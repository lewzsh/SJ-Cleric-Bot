Lumpy Space Princess| Ugh.  Reduced to marking my camp with bear sweat. Those bears did not want to give up that sweat,  but it keeps the rodents from nibbling my lumps while I sleep. Ouch! I feel something crunchy! Like fried chicken!  Oh, it is fried chicken!
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, my Glob—forest creature! I'd better eat it real fast!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Get back here!     Aah!  What my life has become!
Lumpy Space Princess| Hello? Oh, my Glob!
Tree Trunks| Oh, wonderful!  Welcome in, LSP. Uh, I want to go through—
Lumpy Space Princess| This place is so clean and nice!
Tree Trunks| You're so kind.
Lumpy Space Princess| Do you have a sink?!
Tree Trunks| Uh, there's one in the kitchen, and—
Lumpy Space Princess| I'll use the one in the kitchen!  
Tree Trunks| I need to tell you all the s—
Lumpy Space Princess| Get me a towel!
Lumpy Space Princess| Help me down!
Tree Trunks|  O-okay, I-I really do need to tell you how to care for Sweet P. Uh, there's a proper procedure for Sweet P's special tuck-in time. You have to be real sweet to him. Pat him gently on the head, kiss his cheeks...
Lumpy Space Princess| What?
Tree Trunks|" ...And give him treats. Sing to him real, real soft and sweet and touch your forehead to his and think the words, ""You are more precious than anything in this world, and I will always, always love you."" Then he'll fall asleep and have sweet dreams."
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, my Glob, I'll do all that! Okay, bye! Have a wonderful time!  Time to get down to the chill-out!
Lumpy Space Princess| What a princess like me deserves.  Aah! Don't hurt me!
Sweet P| I'm Sweet P.
Lumpy Space Princess| I didn't know you were huge.
Sweet P| I'm hungry.
Lumpy Space Princess| Okay, let's check what's in the fridge.  Do you like pizza?
Sweet P| I like pizza.
Lumpy Space Princess|   Get the pizza, Sweet P!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Now I can kick back.   Refrigerators are just great! I never stopped to think how great they are.     Now I'm cold, though.  Oh, what?!  I'm still cold.   Rich-person indoor fire is just so great.  I'm feeling all toasty! Must be time for toast!  I'm waiting... Waiting... Waiting... All done!   It's not black and crunchy like when I throw bread into my campfire.
Lumpy Space Princess| This music's way better than owls' hoots.
Lumpy Space Princess|  I deserve this.
Lumpy Space Princess| No! You're an animal! You can't come inside!  
Sweet P|  I'm ready to be tucked in now. Hello? Will you be sweet to me?
Sweet P|  Sweetness must be out there in the night to guide my sleepy boat right. 
Marceline| Yo!
Lumpy Space Princess| Hey, Marcy!
Marceline| LSPita bread, what's up? 
Lumpy Space Princess| Just chillin' in my awesome bubble bath!
Marceline| Did you break into someone's house again?
Lumpy Space Princess| Ugh! I have a new life now and a career.
Marceline| I didn't know you had any skills.
Lumpy Space Princess|" Success isn't about skills. It's about being cool. These people just randomly approached me, like, ""Hey, we will totally pay you to hang out in our sick mansion and feed our baby"" or whatever."
Marceline| Well, good for you, dude.
Lumpy Space Princess| I mean, I feel like a totally new person now that I'm finally getting what I deserve.
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, my Glob, what is that?!
Lumpy Space Princess| Aah! 
Marceline| LSP? Mm.
Raccoon|  
Lumpy Space Princess|   Take this, you dandruff! 
Raccoon| LSP.
Lumpy Space Princess| Huh?
Raccoon| You don't belong here in the world of decent people. You belong in the woods with...  garbage animals!
Lumpy Space Princess| Noooooooo!
Sweet P| Will you be sweet to me?
Sweet P| Will you kiss my cheeks?
Sweet P|  Will you give me treats?
Sweet P|  Blech! 
Sweet P| Will you be sweet to me?
Banana Guards| Wee-Ooo! Wee-Ooo! Wee-Ooo! Wee-Ooo!
Lumpy Space Princess| Agh!    
Raccoon| Look what you've done, LSP.
Lumpy Space Princess| Huh?
Raccoon| You made it gross. Everything you touch turns gross!
Lumpy Space Princess| Uh...
Raccoon| Just like you!
Lumpy Space Princess| Aah!
Raccoon|  You don't really think you deserved any of this, do you? You're a rat, just a giant rat that wandered into somebody's nice house.
Lumpy Space Princess| I'm a good person! I take care of babies!  Look! Baby Sweet P?   Baby Sweet P! Oh, my Glob, I lost the baby! I lost the baby!  I'm a bad person!
Raccoon|  Just accept that you're garbage!
Lumpy Space Princess| Hi-yah!  Baby Sweet P! 
Lumpy Space Princess| Have you seen a big, fat child around here?!  Have you seen my enormous baby?!  If only I'd cooked the pizza!
Lumpy Space Princess| I could've eaten some, too! I'm so stupid!  You got to help me! I lost some old couple's baby 'cause I didn't do the sweet things! I just wanted a bubble bath, and... How did I lose something so bi-i-i-i-g?! 
Banana Guard| Ma'am, you're gonna have to come with us.
Lumpy Space Princess| Baby Sweet P!  Give me that donut! 
Banana Guard| No!
Lumpy Space Princess| I'm not a bad person! I'm not a bad person!
Lumpy Space Princess| Huh?
Banana Guard| Hey, big baby!
Lumpy Space Princess| I found you!
Sweet P|  LSP!
Lumpy Space Princess| Sweet P! I'm so sorry! I should've been sweet to you! Here, okay, um... Pat very gently on the head... Kiss on both cheeks... Mwah! Mwah! Treat. 
Sweet P| Mmm! 
Lumpy Space Princess| Uh, and sing something sweet.  ♪ Butter cakes, cupcakes, and ice cream cakes small baby bums and the friendship of puppies ♪  You are more precious than anything in this world, and I will always, always love you.
Lumpy Space Princess| Aww!
Tree Trunks| We're ho-o-me!
Lumpy Space Princess| Shh! He's asleep.
Tree Trunks| Why is Sweet P's blanket on the wall—?
Lumpy Space Princess| Shh!  Mr. and Mrs. Pig Trunks, I have some good news. Sweet P has grown so attached to me that it would be cruel for me to leave him, obviously. So... Yes, I will accept the position as your live-in nanny!
Lumpy Space Princess| Huh?
Raccoon| Partake of the chicken. 
Lumpy Space Princess| Chicken...  
Lumpy Space Princess| This is good chicken!
Tree Trunks|  Maybe we can get, uh, Neptr to sit. I don't know.
Sweet P| Mama? I had that dream again—the one where I'm a comet boy.
Tree Trunks| Oh, really?
Sweet P| Yeah, coming back to Ooo over and over, and there was a fake comet, a beard man in a spaceship.
Tree Trunks| My, what an imagination...
Sweet P| The comet... approacheth.
Jake|  Hey, man. 
Finn|  What's so funny?
Jake|  Oh, you know, just takin' this garbage bag of butter...  ...into the house. 
Finn|  Dude. That's not that funny.  EAAH!!
Jake|  HAHAHAHAHA!
Finn|  Ohhh, butter pranked! I can't believe I didn't see that coming!
Jake|  Heh, yeah, I'm a genius.
Finn|  You have offended my honor, sir, and in so doing, you have awoken the pranking demon that sleeps in my pits! The demon is coming for you, mortal. It is going to prank you... so... HARD!
Jake|  Whatever. I'm gonna take a day long nap. 
Finn|  That's right, suckah! Go nap it up, for when you awake, the pranking demon will be upon you!   Aww, man! Nothing's better than throwing a big bag of butter at someone!  Gotta think! What's... a better prank... than butter?! Answer me, book! What's better than butter?! A unicorn.  A treasure hunter!  A battleship!  A pie!  A young girl in lo—Wait! Book, rewind!  That's it! I'll throw never-ending pies at Jake's face forever! 
Finn|  It's never-ending pie-throwing time! C'mon, dude! Turn on!  Why isn't it working?!  I'll never make a prank better than Jake's garbage bag full of butter. 
Neptr|  Ouch!
Finn|  Holy stuff! It talked! Wow-cow-chow!
Neptr|  Greeting, creator!
Finn|  Oh, whoa! Hey, man!
Neptr|"  My name is Neptr, which stands for ""Never-Ending Pie-Throwing Robot."""
Finn|  Oh, perfect! You're exactly the kind of robot I was trying to make!
Neptr|  Creator, I am eager to commence the creation and propulsion of pies forever, but my pie-hucking appendage is... malfunctioning, and my oven lamp is cold, and my tank treads do not roll! They only do skids! Why, creator?!  Does it please you to watch me struggle?!
Finn|  Neptr! Don't say stuff like that! Look, I know we just met, and you're probably goin' through a lot of personal stuff right now, but I really like you, Neptr, and I'm not gonna rest until you're working properly and throwing hot pie on my best friend's face. Together, we're gonna prank the poots out of Jake!
Neptr|  Haha! I'll always love you, creator!
Finn|  I know you will, Neptr. Now, all we need is more lightning power so you can be operating at full capacity! And I think I know just the dumb-hole who we can get some from.
Neptr|  Ooh, what beautiful piles of sugar!
Finn|  Heh. No, Neptr. We call that snow.
Neptr|  Snoooow??
Finn|  UNH!  Did y'all smack me into that mountain on purpose?
Balloons|  Yeah!
Finn|  Take note, Neptr. These guys are grade-A pranksters. You guys hang out in case we need a daring escape!
One Balloon|  I got his wallet. 
Finn|  Just gotta sneak around until we find his lightning bolt stash.
Neptr|  But, creator, is not breaking and entering wrong?
Finn|  No, we're pranking and entering, which is awesome!
Neptr|  Sneaking! We're sneaking...
Finn|   Shush, Neptr!
Neptr|  Sneaking...
Finn|  Shh!
Neptr|  Sneaking...
Finn|  Neptr, you're gonna get us caught!
Neptr|  Sneaking!
Ice King|  Is that you, honey?  How was your day at work?  Terrible! How could I possibly stand to be apart from you, the Ice King?!  You see, Gunter, that's how it would go if I actually had a wife.
Penguin|  Wenk.
Ice King|  Game time!  Kill the frog! Kill the frog! C'mon! Oh, he's right in front of you! Lower! L— Stupid lady. Kill it...
Neptr|  Creator, if we get caught, I want you to know that I will always love you.
Finn|  Shh! You already told me that! And we're not getting caught! We're gonna get you working so you can prank Jake! He could wake up from his nap at any second!
Jake|  I might wake up at any moment! Naaaah, I'm still asleep.
Ice King|  No, no! That frog is casting magic missiles on my babe! 
Finn|   Quickly! While he's distracted!
Ice King|  No, c'mon, get out of the—UGH! Move!
Penguin|  Wenk!
Ice King|  Baaaugh!  This game cheats anyway!  LOOK WHAT YOU DID, GUNTER!!
Finn|  We're home free, Neptr.
Penguin|  Wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk wenk!
Ice King|  What are you on about? You're starting to infuriate me... It's almost like you're trying to alert me—warn me about... I don't know, an intruder or something? Perhaps he's lurking in this very room, just outside my field of vision!
Penguin|  Wenk wenk wenk wenk.
Ice King|  Well, knock it off!!
Neptr|  What'll we do, creator?
Finn|  We're gonna prank 'im, Neptr. Hardcore.
Ice King|   Hmm. You're looking kinda fat, Gunter! Look at these arms! Fat fat fat! Daddy's little fattie! Oh, you'll never get a prom date with all that chub on your face, you know!  Ooh! Oh, blast these melty ceilings!
Finn|  Hee hee hee hee!
Neptr|  Creator, you have shown me the joys of pranking! I cannot wait to throw pies infinitely at Jake's face!
Finn|  The ceiling really is melty!  Whoa! Whoa! 
Ice King|  What was that?
Finn|  WAAAAH!
Ice Toads|  Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!
Finn|  Figs!
Ice King|  Huh? An intruder! Maybe a beautiful princess like in my poems.
Finn|  We've gotta find that lightning as fast as—
Neptr|  Creator! Lightning!
Finn|  It's a lightning-shaped door! And we're gonna smash right into it! Hold on, Neptr! I got a plan!
Neptr|  That was a great plan!
Finn|  Nah, that wasn't my plan. We got lucky!
Neptr|  Are those my tickets to the gun show, creator?
Finn|  Mm-hmm. You're gonna be fully functional just like I promised.
Ice King|  Whoa, ice-o-pede! Finn?! Oh, why can't you ever be a princess?! Ice-o-pede, attack!  Ice-o-pede, no! Aaah!
Finn|  Let's grab some lightning and get outta here!
Ice King|  Hahaha! Finish him off, my semi-loyal pet!  An innocent bystander?! ZAP!
Finn|  Neptr! NOOOOO!  NOOOOOO!—Oh, yeah. That's what we wanted to happen.
Neptr|  Neptr is fully functional! Yay! 
Finn|  Neptr! Yeah!
Ice King|  Crush him! Crush him like you crushed me!!
Neptr|  Creator?
Finn|  Neptr! The pies! Pies!
Neptr|  Oh, right!
Ice King|  Come on!
Finn|  What was in those pies?!
Neptr|  Just boysenberry. Hahaha. And also... poison.
Finn|   Neptr's acting... different.
Balloons|  Quick, Finn! Jump!
Finn|  Heh heh. You guys got me.
Ice King|   Something about that robot I tried to kill fills me with... deep longing.
Finn|  Thanks, guys. Your blood-oath is fulfilled.
Balloons|  Yay! To the mesosphere!
One Balloon|  Finally we can die!
Neptr|  I am troubled, creator. Troubled by a sudden urge to... collect princesses.
Finn|  Neptr, that's a heavy unsettling thing to say, but pull yourself together. We're about to prank Jake!
Neptr|   Uh-huh. Sure.
Finn|  One... two...
Ice King|   THREE!
Finn|  Run, Neptr!!
Neptr|  Oooh!
Finn|   Hah! Hah! Hah!  Aw, man.
Ice King|  I've come to take my son.
Finn|  Your son?!
Ice King|  Come to Papi, son. I won't attack you... unless provoked.
Finn|  He's not your son! If anything, he's my son!
Ice King|  It was my power that activated his full potential. Zzz. 
Neptr|  Oooh...
Ice King|  When you were struck by my lightening, you also became infused with my private particles. He wants to be with me, Finn!
Finn|  No way! Neptr wants to help me prank Jake!
Neptr|  I am torn! I am processing a love for both princesses and pranking!
Ice King|  Don't worry, son. I'll show you the life you deserve! 
Finn|  No! Neptr!
Ice King|  Yes! Now that we've entered my imagination zone, allow me to tantalize you with this!  Princesses! As my son, you will carry on the tradition of capturing ladies!
Neptr|  Tell me more, Papi!
Finn|  No, Neptr!
Ice King|  I want a son who can do better than I. One who can succeed where I... have failed. You can mate with robot princesses!
Neptr|  Can I still prank with Finn after?
Ice King|  NO!! I'll show you what will happen if you hang out with Finn!
Imaginary Finn & Jake|  Yeah! Pootin' on Neptr to the max!
Neptr|  Haha! Yeah, I love Finn's pranks!
Ice King|  NOOOOO!!  I'm through playing around, son. Who do you choose?
Finn|  Come on, Neptr. Choose me, buddy. Choose pranks.
Neptr|  I... uh, I... choose... Ice King!
Finn|  WHAT?! You've gotta be flippin' kidding me!
Ice King|  He made his choice! Get over it, crybaby!
Neptr|  I'm not finished. I choose Ice King... to prank! Hardcore!
Ice King|   WHHHAAAAT—  Aah! My face!  I birthed you and I can un-birth you!
Finn|  NEVER!
Ice King|  OOF! 
Neptr|  Sleep well, Papi. In your Imagination Zone full of beautiful princesses.
Finn|  You wanna prank Jake?
Neptr|  It's why I was created.
Finn|  Haha, okay. Let's gooooo!  Jake! Wake up!
Jake|   Ahhh, hey, du—AAAAAH!
Imaginary Neptr|  Sun is going down. Shall we capture princesses now, Papi?
Ice King|  No, let's just stay here a little longer, son.
Imaginary Neptr|  I love you forever, Papi.
BMO|  Haha! Take that, Master Chen!
Finn|  JAAAAKE!
Jake|  What?
Finn|  Jake, did you hide my sock?
Jake|  No, man, I told you,
Jake|  I don't do that kinda stuff anymore.
Finn|  So, what? It just magically disappeared?
Jake|  I don't know...
Jake|  Maybe.
Finn|  Is that just a cute way of saying you took it?
Jake|  No!
Finn|  Why don't you just help me find my sock?
Jake|   Oh, Finn lost his sock! Everybody stop what you're doing and help Finn find his precious sock!
BMO|   It looked like a tough case to crack. But I hate to see good friends fight.
BMO|   So I decided to take the case.
BMO|   Hmm... 
BMO|   Ronnie!
BMO|   It looked like I had a guilty mouse.
BMO|  
BMO|  Huh!
BMO|  Hello, Ronnie.
BMO|  What do you want, BMO?
BMO|  Where is Finn's sock?
BMO|  I don't know what you're talking about, BMO. I didn't do nothin'. Leave me alone!
BMO|   I knew that lipstick anywhere. 
BMO|   How is Lorraine?
BMO|  You stay away from her! She is with me now, do you hear?
BMO|  Calm down, big guy. Me and Lorraine are dinosaur bones.
BMO|  Good, 'cause I would be so jealous.
BMO|  Just tell me where the sock is, and I will let you go.
BMO|  I don't know, man.
BMO|  What if I put some knuckle in your eyeballs? Would that help you think?
BMO|  Ok! Ok! Umm...
BMO| It looks like a grape juice stain on his sock; check the pantry.
BMO|   Of course I didn't trust Ronnie, but I had no other leads.  Maybe the grape juice had some secrets to tell me. Or maybe Ronnie was just pulling my hair. 
BMO|  
BMO|   Just as I thought, not even opened. I fell right into his trap.
BMO|    Let me out, you! I'll get you! Piece of... you! Ronnie!  Officer Davis! Thank goodness. I... 
BMO|  BMO, what are you doing here?
BMO|  Looking for Finn's socks, same as you.
BMO|  We got this to under control.  Stay out of police business, or you will be the one behind bars.
BMO|    I didn't listen to that cop. I needed to find Ronnie, and I knew just the lady who could lead me to him.  She looked as beautiful as ever.
BMO|  Where is the sock, Lorraine? 
BMO|  What makes you think I know? 
BMO|  I saw your lipstick on his fur, so don't act so cute. 
BMO|  Sounds like someone's jealous, no?
BMO|  Don't count on it, Lorraine. Now tell me where Ronnie is.
BMO|  Ha! You think it was Ronnie? Maybe if he was man enough to steal a sock, I wouldn't have to spend my nights with Bebe.
BMO|  Bebe? So you're saying Bebe is man enough?
BMO|  What? No, you're putting words in my mouth. Bebe doesn't know anything about Finn's sock.
BMO|   Finn's sock? How did you know it was Finn's sock? I never said whose sock was stolen, Lorraine.
BMO|  Uh... uh... I heard it on the TV news.
BMO|  No dice, sweet beak. Officer Davis has this case under tight wraps.
BMO|  Oh, fine, Bebe stole the sock. Oh, BMO, can't you just forget about it?
BMO|   Sorry, lady, forgetting ain't in my job description. Ha ha ha!
BMO|  Does that mean you still remember... us?
BMO|  ... Hahaha! Same old Lorraine.
BMO|  Well, don't tell Ronnie about me and Bebe.  You know how he gets when he's jealous. 
BMO|   Bebe owned Bebe's, a dance club downtown.  He yells at ladies!
BMO|  Wake up, brainiac.
BMO|  BMO? Uh...uh...auh!
BMO|  Where is the sock, Bebe?
BMO|  Uh ... I don't know nothing about socks!
BMO|  Don't play dumb, Bebe!  Don't play dumb with me!
BMO|  
BMO|  I talked to Lorraine, Bebe. She sold you out, dumb dumb!
BMO|  No! She-she wouldn't do that! It wasn't me, I swear! It was Ronnie!
BMO|   Ronnie? But why?
BMO|  I don't know, man! I don't know!  Oh, Lorraine! 
BMO|   I'm gonna go wash this shmutz off my grabbers. When I get back, you better start talking sense!
BMO|    It wasn't adding up. Why would Ronnie swipe the sock? And why would Lorraine finger Bebe?  Sure, he's a dirt bag born out of a mother, but who's not?
BMO|   I don't really get it.
BMO|   Maybe it was time to cut my losses.
BMO|  Come on, Bebe, let's get you cleaned up. Bebe?
BMO|  Bebe!  Dead. This doesn't look good. I'd better hightail it!
BMO|  Huh? The cops!? It was a setup!
BMO|   Oh no!  Bang, bang! Pew, pew, pew!
Jake| Hey, has anyone seen BMO?  BMO? Where's BMO?
BMO|   Hello?
Finn|   I'm worried about BMO.
BMO|   This is real.
Jake|   BMO!
BMO|   Who's BMO?
Different BMO|  Hello. 
Neptr|  Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey, BMO. Wake up, buddy. Are you alright?
BMO|  Neptr? I feel like I got hit with a Dracula by King Kong.
Neptr|  Whoa, sorry, man. You want some pie or something?
BMO|  Sorry, I gotta run. The cops are after me. Have you seen any down here?
Neptr|  Nah, no one's been down here all day except me, you, and Ronnie.
BMO|  What?! What was Ronnie doing down here?!
Neptr|  I don't know, but now my sensors indicate that some treasure is missing ...about a sock's worth.
BMO|   That's it! That's why Ronnie took the sock To carry stolen treasure in with! He had to whack Bebe to keep him from squealing, then he pinned the rap on me.
Neptr|  Bebe's dead?
BMO|  Listen, Neptr you better lay low for awhile. I'm gonna go find Ronnie . I've got a score to settle.
Neptr|  Hey, BMO. We should hang out more. We're both robots.
BMO|  No, Neptr. I am not like you.
BMO|  Ronnie?
BMO|  Evening, BMO.
BMO|  Don't worry, buddy. You're off the hook. We know it was Ronnie who killed Bebe and snatched the treasure . We found this confession on him after the shootout.
BMO|  Hmmmmm...what about the sock?
BMO|  Forget the sock, BMO. The case is closed. Let it go, buddy. It's over.
BMO|  Maybe he was right. But I just couldn't shake the feeling that, somehow, this case had slipped right through my fingers.  Lipstick? 
BMO|  Lorraine!
BMO|  BMO?
BMO|  Get back here with that treasure, Lorraine!
BMO|  Sorry, BMO. I earned this loot. Those chumps were not framing themselves. See you around, BMO.
BMO|  Lorraine, wait! What about the sock, Lorraine?
BMO|  Oh, that old thing? I hid that where no one would ever find it in our secret, grown-up kissing spot. Remember?
BMO|  It was good to see you again, BMO . Till next time.
BMO|  Till next time, Lorraine.
Jake|  Ya see, man? That was really fun. You don't need two socks to have fun. 
Finn|  Yeah, I guess. But maybe it woulda been more fun with two socks! 
BMO|  Finn, Finn! I know where your sock is!
Finn|  Huh?
BMO|   It was in your pillow this whole time! See?
Finn|  Whoa haha!  Right on, BMO!
BMO|  Ronnie the mouse stole it, but Lorraine chicken set him up to kill Bebe, but the flatfoot busted Ronnie, and Lorraine skedaddled with the loot, but BMO solved the case!
Finn|  Yay, BMO! Yay! Yeah!
BMO|  Yay, BMO!
Finn|  Yay!
BMO|  Yay, BMO!
Jake|  Our chicken's name is Lorraine?
BMO|  She's red hot like pizza supper .
Princess Bubblegum|  In the Kingdom of Ooo there is a galaxy of flavors, but only one taste sensation is amazing enough to kill for—the Royal tart.   Royal tarts are very rare. They are only eaten at the most sacred gathering in Ooo—the annual Back-Rubbing Ceremony . The tart is so legendary that countless thieves will risk their lives for just one bite. 
Princess Bubblegum| My head will be decapitated if the tarts don't make it to the ceremony. I only trust one guy to deliver them... the Royal Tart Toter.
Finn and Jake| Whoa!
Jake| He's magnificent!
Princess Bubblegum| He used to be, but he's gone mad and old. So he can't deliver the tarts anymore. Cinnamon Bun offered to fill the position, but he's kind of... half-baked.
Cinnamon Bun| Hey Princess! Here I go!  I'm stuck.
Finn| Princess, let us deliver the tarts.
Princess Bubblegum| Are you sure Finn? This is really important.
Finn|  Princess, I have never been more sure of anything in my whole life!  I'll do anything it takes to keep you alive and safe. We won't let you down.
Princess Bubblegum| Well... I accept your offer.
Princess Bubblegum| Welcome to the Tartorium!
Finn|  Wow.  They're so beautiful.
Princess Bubblegum| No, boys. Those are the reject tarts, full of imperfections.  These are the perfect tarts...  safely packed into one of my anti-gravity tote chambers.
Finn and Jake| Tote sweet!
Princess Bubblegum| Now, I want you to tote those tarts through that tunnel.  The Royal Tart Path takes you directly to the Royal Congressional Hall in the Bad Lands. The path is really safe and well protected, but keep your eyes open for any sign of danger, okay?
Finn| Mmm hmm.
Jake| Yep.
Princess Bubblegum| Good. Now here's your map. 
Finn|  Hey Princess, what are all these bubbling chemicals all over the place?
Princess Bubblegum| That's paralyzing potion, Finn! Don't touch it. It'll paralyze you forever! 
Finn| Oh. 
Princess Bubblegum| Thank you, boys. And remember, my head is on the line! 
Jake| All right, let's hit it. 
Finn| Wait. I got a sick plan! 
Finn| Go!
Cinnamon Bun| Okay.  Bye! Bye-bye! Bye-bye! Bye!
Finn|  Goodbye! You'll be fine! Hahaha!
Jake|  Bye! Goodbye!
Jake|  Heh, that was fun, but why'd you do it?
Finn|  Look, everyone expects the tarts to on that Royal Tart Path. Cinnamon Bun will be our decoy while we take the one path no thief expect a tart toter to take the Desert of Doom!
Jake|  I guess this is it.
Finn|  Huh, not as scary as I thought it'd be.
Jake|  Yeah, man, mostly just looks empty. I mean, what thief would ever hang out here? There's nothing to steal!
Finn|  You know, I think my plan might be kinda brilliant. I mean, I'm not saying I'm the brilliant, but it's a pretty brilliant plan, I think.
Jake|  True, true. This place is perfect for toting tarts.
Finn|  Yeah, and the Back-Rubbing Ceremony is right over those mountains.  This tart tote is gonna be a total tart walk.
Jake|  Heheheh, yeah. Ohh, wait! Hold up!
Finn|  What is it?
Jake|  Shh.  It's a campfire—close by.
Finn|   Does it smell like a tart thief's campfire?
Jake|  Maybe.
Finn|  Better check it out—can't be too careful. 
Taddle|  D-d-don't burn it now, Grimby.
Grimby|  Hush.  I ain't gon' burn it.
Finn|  Crud! I was sure we'd be safe in the Desert of Doom!
Jake|  What? Whatcha sayin'?
Finn|  Those are dirty tart burglers!
Jake|  I think they're just dirty hobos.
Finn|  No, man, they are cold-blooded tart destroyers and we have to get them before they get us.
Jake|  Why?
Finn|  They're gonna kill Princess Bubblegum by stealin' our tarts!
Jake|  Oh, yeah.
Taddle|  But how come JJ gets to hold it, Grimby?
Jake|  Rawr! 
Finn|  Yeah, go on, get! We'll mash you up crazy!  You! Listen up and tell your friends the next time you wanna steal one of our tarts—!
Grimby|   You got tarts?
Finn|  You know we do! And the next time you want to steal one—!  You picture this guy right here  chewin' on your brain!  What the—?!  That thing's gettin' the tarts!
Finn|  Son of a—.
Taddle and Grimby|  We eatin' good tonight! 
Jake|  Uh-oh, man, he got, like, five or six!
Finn|  But... my brilliant plan.
Holo-Pendant|  Incoming transmission from Princess Bubblegum.
Finn|  What the—? 
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey, Finn.
Finn|   
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm just checking in using the holo-pendant. How are my tarts doing?
Finn|  They're, um... th-they're—
Jake|  They're radical! No tart problems here!
Finn|  Uhh, yeah! Right! Everything's, uh—bazoobs! Oh, look, something is eclipsing the sun. It's so dark now. 
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn? Finn! Oh, well, I'll see you soon enough!
Holo-Pendant|  Transmission complete.
Jake|  I think the plan went awry.
Finn|  No! All this was just some freak bad luck, but we still got some tarts and the princess is still safe.
Jake|  Oh, yeah, and who knows what kind of freaky things would have happened if we took the Royal Tart Path?  Heheh, old Cinnamon Bun's probably got his hands full.
Cinnamon Bun|  Bye! Goodbye! Bye-bye!
Royal Tart Path Guard 1|  Hello!
Cinnamon Bun| Hello!
Royal Tart Path Guard 1|  Shall I hold that for you, sir?
Cinnamon Bun|  Okay. 
Royal Tart Path Guard 2|  Shall I hold that for you, sir?
Royal Tart Path Guard 1|  Okay.
Royal Tart Path Guard 3|  Shall I hold that for you, sir?
Royal Tart Path Guard 2|  Okay.
Royal Tart Path Guard 4|  Shall I hold that for you, sir?
Royal Tart Path Guard 3|  Okay.
Royal Tart Path Guard 5|  Shall I hold that for you, sir?
Royal Tart Path Guard 4|  Okay.
Royal Tart Path Guard 6|  Shall I hold that for you, sir?
Royal Tart Path Guard 5|  Okay.
Royal Tart Path Guard 7|  Shall I hold that for you, sir?
Royal Tart Path Guard 6|  Okay.
Royal Tart Path Guard 8|  Shall I hold that for you, sir?
Royal Tart Path Guard 7|  Okay.
Finn|  You know what? Even though it totally wasn't our fault, it's probably for the best that we lost those tarts. 
Jake|  Huh? How?
Finn|  Well, it's like a reminder to really stay sharp and play it extra safe.
Finn|  For instance, take this scary cavern, here. No sane person would ever bring a tart down there. So...
Jake|  So no thieves!
Finn|  Exactly.
Jake|  You are on a roll today, buddy!
Finn|  P.U.!
Jake|  Yeah, P.U.!
Finn|  Jake?
Jake|  Yeah?
Finn|  Hey, man, did you just, like, sniff my butt?
Jake|  Uh, just now?
Finn|  Yeah.
Jake|  No.
Finn|  Huh. Alright.
Jake|  Hmm. Hey, Finn?
Finn|  Yeah, Jake?
Jake|  Did you just, uh, lick me—all the way up my arm?
Finn|  No.
Jake|  Hmm. Strange.
Finn|  Jake, let me see those matches.
Finn & Jake|  
Jake|  Uh-oh! Man, we got got! There's only two left!
Finn|  What?!
Holo-Pendant|  Incoming transmission from Princess Bubblegum.
Finn|  Aaaaah!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hello?
Finn|  We blew it, man! My plan sucked—it sucked all along—but I was blinded by my hubris! Now PB is gonna get got, and it's all my fault!
Jake|  Whoa, whoa, take it easy, buddy. We've still got two whole tarts left. PB is gonna be fine.
Finn|  You really think so?
Jake|  Yeah, why not?
Butterfly|  Hey! Keep off them tarts!
Finn|  Huh?
Butterfly Bandit|  I said back off of them tarts! Are you an imbecile?!
Finn|  But I—
Bandit Butterfly|  Right the bazoobs now! 
Jake|  Finn, he's got a laser gun!
Bandit Butterfly|  Yeah! That's it. Alright,  now I gotta book it to Nana's for brunch! See youse later!
Finn|  It's over. PB's gonna get croaked.
Jake|  Mmm, yeah—or... we could smash in there and stop Congress from chopping her head off.
Finn|  You're right! Jake, let's go save Princess Bubblegum!
Backrubbers|  Chop! Chop! Chop! Chop!
Finn|  NOOOOO!!!!
Finn|  Aaaaah! ... Huh?
Princess Bubblegum|  Another perfectly chopped tart!
Princess Bubblegum|  Let the annual Back-Rubbing Ceremony begin!
Finn|  Dude, they were just slicing tarts!
Jake|  And there's Cinnamon Bun over there!
Cinnamon Bun|  Hey!
Finn|  He must have delivered the decoys...
Finn and Jake|  the ones we poisoned!
Finn|  Nooo!
Finn|  Princess, don't eat that tart!
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay! Jeez, Finn, I won't eat that tart. I'll eat this other tart instead!
Finn|  No, Princess, no!
Finn|  The princess has been paralyzed!
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm not paralyzed! I'm gripped with the flavor!
Finn|  That means we must have been carrying the poisoned tarts all along!
Finn|  Yep! All part of my master plan.
Jake|  Psht! Whatever, man. Heh heh.
Princess Bubblegum|  Excuse me! What is this about poisoned tarts and alternate plans?
Finn|  I-I—alright, here it comes.  I had a brilliant plan to tote the tarts along a dangerous path, but I mucked it up.  You oughtta give this toter job to Cinnamon Bun. He's the real hero.
Cinnamon Bun|   Yeah! 
Finn|  I'm sorry for not following your instructions and for lying to you about it.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, Finn, I forgive you—'cause I lied to you, too! They weren't going to decapitate me; I just said that so you guys wouldn't eat the tarts!
Finn|  Oh!
Princess Bubblegum|  So I guess we're even.
Finn|  Uhh, yeah, I guess so.
Royal Tart Toter|  Ladies and gentlemen! The Royal Tarts have arrived.
Backrubbers|  
Princess Bubblegum|  The old Tart Toter!  Nobody move! He can't see or hear, but he can feel your movement.
Royal Tart Toter|  Hello? Eat my tarts? This cosmic dance of bursting decadence and withheld permissions twists all our arms collectively, but if sweetness can win—and it can— then I'll still be here tomorrow, to high-five you yesterday, my friends. Peace.
Finn|  Sheesh!
Finn|  Get it, get it!
Finn|   Yah!
Jake|   Oooooooh!
Jake|  Get him out!
Finn|  Don't you ever let me catch you here again!
Finn|  Whoo-hoo! Ya ha ha ha ha!  Agh! Ow!  Ooooooow! Agh agh mee duh!
Jake|  Did he get you with his poison stingers?
Finn|  No, I got a splinter from the door.
Jake|  Let me see. Wow, that's a tiny splinter.
Finn|  But it hurts! I'm gonna need some...  ...finger protection! Thanks, Choose Goose.
Choose Goose|  I am Choose Goose. Come back for some juice! Ha ha ha ha ha!
Finn|  Man, I am so protected right now!
Knight 1|  That is mighty thick. Go on, hit me! 
Finn|  Hey guys! Check this out! Dude, hit me!  Oww!  On my armor!
Jake|  Oh. 
Finn|   Click-click!
Knight 1|  That is but a thimble! This  is real armor! 
Finn & Jake|  Wha?
All Knights|  Sir Slicer! 
Sir Slicer|  Who is the one that bears the thimble? 
Jake|  This dude. 
Sir Slicer|  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Oh, you foolish boy. Without full body armor, you're weak! You do not look  Click-click! Ha ha ha ha. Yah! 
Finn|  Choose Goose, I need more armor.
Choose Goose|  I've got something for you -- a metal shoe! Don't ya know you might stub your toe?
Finn|  Uhh, no, Choose Goose. I need...
Choose Goose|  Look here hun. Choose this one to protect your buns !
One knight|  Protect his butt! Protect his butt!
Finn|   No, Choose Goose. I want--
Choose Goose|  Don't be meek. What if you fall down and scrape your cheek?
One knight|  Look at his butt!  Look at his butt!
Finn|   Choose Goose, I want the most  Click-click armor you have!
Choose Goose|  Ooh, have a look! 
Finn|   I'll take that one! 
Choose Goose|   Wonderful! I'll need a trade of equal value. I'll take the head of your dog friend! 
Jake|  Say what?
Finn|  No way! Choose Goose, this stuff is overpriced!
Choose Goose|  No money for me? How about a poem for free?
Finn|   A poem?
Choose Goose|  If you can decipher the poem and complete the trials, you will receive the magical Armor of Zeldron. It is foretold to be totally  Click-click! 
Finn & Jake|  Skadow!
Choose Goose|   Your quest begins in the marsh over the hill.
Finn|  Ah, yes! I'm gonna get that armor!
Jake|  Yeah, man, you're gonna do it! 
Sir Slicer|  Good luck exposing your soft, vanilla-strawberry skin to the elements, dork! Haaaaaaa! Later, losers! 
Finn|  Ja!  He's just jealous that I'm gonna have cooler armor than him!
Jake|  Yeah, what a bumbleberry!
Finn & Jake|  Whoa! 
Jake|  What's the poem say?
Finn|"  ""The sun nibbles on the clouds, and gum drop tears rain down."" I don't get it..."
Jake|   Hmm... It means that we have to cross that swamp.
Finn|  How'd you understand that?
Jake|  You don't just read the poetry to understand it. You got to  feel it. Trust me, dude-- I'm smarter than everyone. Now get in there!
Finn|  You're not coming?
Jake|  No way, man. This armor thing is your deal!  I'll wait for you on the other side.
Finn|   This place will be a piece of... 
Old Lady|  Aah!
Finn|  Aaaaah!!! Oh, my gosh! I'm so sorry!  Aaaaaaaaah!!!
Old Lady|  Oh, no! 
Old Guy|   My most private parts peeped by a boy!
Finn|  Huuuh!!! 
The Mom|  Aah! Pervert!
Finn|  I'm not a pervert! 
The Mom|  You should be ashamed of yourself!
Finn|  I'm sorry! I'm sorry!  Aah!
Man|  My privates!
Finn|  I'm sorry!
Man 2|  My privates!
Finn|  I'm sorry!
Jake|  You okay, man?
Finn|  No! 
Sir Slicer|  Ha ha ha ha ha!
Finn & Jake|  Wha?!
Sir Slicer|  What's the matter, crimson cheeks? Feeling a little embarrassed in the swamp of embarrassment?  You're so red, you look like a tomato. Ha ha ha ha! 
Finn|  Aahhhh! We'll see who's embarrassed when I get that armor! What does the poem say?
Jake|"   Hmm... Ooh! ""The meadow weeps as morning sings of milk and honey and things to come."""
Finn|  What does that even mean?!
Jake|  It means we have to silence the echoing in the woods. 
Finn & Jake|  Huh! 
Finn|  Aw, man! I don't know how to silence that!
Jake|  All right, I'll handle this one, dude. 
Finn|  No. This is my burden.
Jake|  Then just make her think it's her idea. That's how you make the ladies do what you want.
Finn|   Hey, Monster Lady! Hey! Stop crying!
The Animal|  Huh?
Finn|  Stop crying because that's what you want to do!
The Animal|  Hu ha huh? 
Finn|  Huh?! Ahh!!! Ahh!!! Ahh ahh ahh!!! Ahh ahh!!! 
The Animal|  Oho... 
Jake|  Ha ha ha! She thinks you're her red-faced baby or something. I think she wants ya to nurse, dude! 
Finn|  Noo!!!
The Animal|  Aaa! Ooh! Mmm! 
Jake|  Huh?
Sir Slicer|  Minstrel? 
Minstrel|"  ""He's Finn the blushing baby / His cheeks are bright and red! / Be sure to make fun of him before you go to bed!"" "
Sir Slicer|  Grandfathers will sing that to their grandchildren for generations to come.
Finn|  Grandfathers will not sing that to their children! 
The Animal|  Oh!
Sir Slicer|  Armor,  Click-click. 
Finn|  Just wait till I have the Armor of Zeldron!
Jake|  Yeah! Just you wait, weirdo!  Uh, Finn? Uh-oh. 
Finn|  Jake? You okay? Huh? 
Finn & Jake|  Yeah!
Finn|  Awesome!
Jake|  Yeah!
Finn & Jake|  Whoa! 
Finn|  Finally!  Yah! 
Ghost Man|  Hello!
Finn|  Begone, ghost! I'm here for the armor!
Ghost Man|  First, you have to beat my high score in a game of Drop Ball 
Finn & Jake|  Drop Ball?
Ghost Man|  Drop Ball is an extremely addictive, high-intensity game designed for people everywhere. Here, let me show ya.  Hut! One point.  Two points. Three points.
Finn|  This game looks awful.
Ghost Man|  Oh, no. I absolutely disagree!
Finn|   Dude, let's just kill him and get the armor.
Jake|  How? He's already dead.
Ghost Man|  Here. It's your turn. Now, I don't want you to be intimidated, but my high score is six!
Finn|  Guh! Just -- just toss it on the ground. 
Ghost Man|  No, no, no! You're doing it all wrong! Let me show you how the pros do it!  See? It's all in the technique. Now, I'm gonna put a little finesse into it, just to shake things up. 
Finn & Jake|  Whoa! 
Jake|  Finn, its so beautiful!
Finn|  Yeah -- guess all the embarrassment was worth it. 
Orb|  Greetings, young traveler. We know what you seek, and you shall receive it.  Behold -- the Armor of Zeldron! It will protect you from evil, even ghosts. 
Finn|  Huh?! Aah!!  No! Dude, this is lady armor!
Jake|   Click-click!
Orb|   Click-click!
Finn|  No! Not Click-click! No more embarrassment!  I don't need armor! 
Ghost Man|   You did not watch my Drop-Ball technique!
Finn & Jake|  Huh?
Ghost Man|  I give you firsthand tips that no one else knows, and this is how you thank me?! I absolutely disagree with that!  Raarg!
Finn|  Now what?
Jake|  Put on the armor! It'll protect you from evil, even ghosts!
Finn|  Never! Yaaaaaaah! 
Monster Ghost|  
Jake|  Hey! 
Monster Ghost|  Huh?
Monster Ghost|  Mama?
Jake|  Uhh... Yeah!  Listen when your mother is speaking to you!
Monster Ghost|  Yes, Mama.
Jake|   You should be ashamed of yourself -- a boy your age sitting in this cave alone for thousands of years. You need to go outside and get some sunlight!
Monster Ghost|  But I...
Jake|   No back talk! Outside! Now!
Monster Ghost|  
Finn|  Whoa.
Person|  Oh, thank you, Finn and Jake! You've freed me from the addiction of Drop Ball! 
Jake|  No problem, dude. I couldn't have done it without  the power of embarrassment!
Finn|  And I learned I don't need armor to be -- 
Sir Slicer|  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Look at you losers. Finn, you don't have any armor, and your friend is dressed like a lady! Ha ha ha! So not Click-click! 
Finn|  Well, at least I don't spend my day following a kid around! Get a life, dude! 
Person and Jake|  Ha ha ha ha
Jake|  Good one, Finn.
Person|  Yeah ha ha.
Sir Slicer|  Well, I've... just been in the same areas today. 
Person & Jake|  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Person|  Yeah, right!
Jake|  Whatever!
Sir Slicer|  Be quiet! I -- I am more Click-click than all of you!
Finn|  Come over here and say that to my fist!
Sir Slicer|  Okay, I will!  Whoa! Er... Ugh, this armor's too heavy! Ah, no problem. I'll just prop myself up on this stick.  Aghhh! Splinter!
Finn|  Hey, Sir Slicer, maybe you can use this!  Here you go! 
Sir Slicer|  Oh!
Finn|  Free of charge!
Jake|   Come on, dude, let's get out of here.
Finn|  Ha ha!  Okay, buddy. 
Jake|   Wa-hoo!  Dude, this armor is totally Click-click!
Jake|  Remember last time we were out this way? It was right after you messed things all up with Flame Princess.
Finn|  Yeah, that sucked. But then we found the Dungeon Train, remember? That was awesome.
Jake| No, it wasn't.
Finn|  Sure it was. Anyway, Flambo's brother's map says the weird cave should be like, right over... Ah! It's right here.  Come on, Jake.
Jake| Okay, hold on. Let me get out my sidewalk chalk. I want to write all over the walls in there.
Finn| What? You can't use that stuff in here. This is like an ancient, sacred temple.
Finn| Oh, well, now, that's just great. You don't put traps in the foyer! The foyer is a safe space. Man, not even Jake could smash through this mess. But maybe there's a back door or something.
Finn| Uh oh! Options. Better leave a little trail in case I get lost. Bread-crumb style. Plus, for if Jake gets in and tries to track me down. Too bad I don't still have that sidewalk ch... Oh!
Finn| Okay, well, scratch that. Now I really hope there's another way out.
Finn| Hall of Egress. Egress, egress.
Finn|  What's 'egress' mean?
Princess Bubblegum|  Exit.
Finn| Egress means exit!
Finn| Great. What am I supposed to do now? 
Finn| Wait. Hey. Hey, I just smashed you. I... Ah... Magic door, okay. Right, but if I...
Finn| Well done, Finn. You solved the magic door. That ought to have done it, and... Oh. This door is too tricky for me. Guess I better give up, right? Wrong, wrong! Let's try that again.
Finn| Hmm. Smooth like metal. Floor's smooth too. What have we here? An errant thread!  It must lead back out. Bread-crumb... Oh, trap door?  Spike trap. Better head back and regroup.
Finn| Fiendish. Anyway, don't let's do that again.
Finn| And right then straight. And... Hey now. Hold the phone, there should be a left turn here. Letters? E... G... 'Egress'. It spells 'egress'. This way! And here's another one, and another...  Whoa!
Finn| Okay. So, every map I make is wrong. All the exit signs led to traps. Plus the braille, the hieroglyphics, and the tape recorder message too. It's  almost like the maze is trying to tell me something. Something confusing, whatever! Who needs anyway with your stupid signs and messages? I'm Finn Mertens, ya heard? And I don't need no nothing! Watch me. 
Jake| Finn? Fi-inn!
Finn| Jake! Jake, I'm coming!
Jake| Finn? Where are ya, buddy?
Finn| Jake!
Finn| That's a little disappointing. Still, though. I'm in the homestretch here.
Finn| Jake!
Jake| Finn! There you are.
Finn| Yeah. Sorry to pop up, then disappear again like that.
Jake| Again? You just got here, son.
Finn| I did? Shoot, man. This cave has got me straight scrambled up and down.
Jake| What cave?
Finn| What? Oh. Uh oh.
Finn| Well?
Jake| Well, I followed your map, but there's just a bunch of grass here.
Finn| What? Let me see! 
Finn| Dang it.
Finn| So, yeah. Everything I did to try to make sense of the maze or to play it safe totally backfired, but when I got fed up, and started just charging in willy-nilly, I was able to get to the end and find you.
Jake| And then the whole thing disappeared. But I wonder how come I don't remember any of it.
Finn| I don't know. I'm just hoping, maybe if I sleep it off, maybe I'll be better in the morning.
Jake| Okay, well... Good night, buddy.
Finn| Thanks, Jake. Good night.
BMO| Are you awake?
Finn| Yes.
BMO| Are you gonna open your eyes now?
Finn| Maybe.
BMO| Are you scared?
Finn| No.
BMO| Then do it.
Finn| On three.
BMO, Finn| One, two, three,...
Jake| So, been almost a month now. What do you think? You wanna try opening 'em? It's beautiful day. Plus, I need someone to tell me if this hat looks cool.
Finn| Man I told you. If I open 'em now, it'll just be the same. I got to wait till something's different.
Jake| Yeah, that makes sense, I guess. So, um, I got you a little something, a little present.
Finn| Wow, thanks man!
Jake| You're really gonna thank me. Gotcha!
Finn| No!
Finn| Yeah, you've done it, like, 30 times now.
Finn| It's like programmed into your DNA or something.
Jake| Well, shoot, man. If I wanna do it that bad, it must be kinda right, right?
Jake| Look at it from where I'm sitting. All this funky pizzazz that only you can see, that's like the literal definition of a hallucination, either all that stuff is a dream or like, I'm a dream. And I ain't no dream, ya heard?
Finn| Yeah, I know, I heard. It's just that, well...
BMO| Hyah! Open up!
Finn| Oh, Jake, I know you mean well, but I guess I got to see this one through on my own.  I'll see you around, buddy.
Finn| Huh? What the... How long has this been going on? Someone's apt to track me down, bread-crumb style, e.g. Jake. Can't let him catch me. No more threads to follow. No more egress.
Finn| Hmm. It's cool in here... Ain't nothing wrong with that. Deep too. That's good. Ain't nobody gonna be looking for me down. Ugh!  Egress! Egress! Egress! Egress!
BMO's voice| Something's different.
Princess Bubblegum's voice| Hurry, Finn. At the seashell's center lies, the cornucopia's smallest door.
Jake| Whoa! That must have been some cave!
Finn| No comment!
Jake| You're totally slow dude, speed up them gams.
Finn| Auh... I'm not used, uh... to running on all fours! Oahh!
Jake| Ready to admit it's harder than it looks?
Finn| I'll never admit anything to you. Hey where'd you go?
Jake| Heh heh heh.
Finn|  Whoa aoh oh! Umpf! Okay I admit it's, it's harder than I thought.
Jake| Actually you did pretty good! Hey check it out!
Finn| Whoa!
Jake| Looks like a giant dead turtle.
Finn| I think it's some kind of city of...
Hag|  Thieves! It's the City of Thieves! Be warned boy! All who enter the city are destined to be come thieves themselves!  Even you.
Finn| I would't become a thief lady! I'm a pretty good guy.
Jake| Yeah, get your glasses on grandma, this kid is pure. In fact he's about to help that little crying kid. 
Finn|  Oh, whoa!
Hag| Be warned!
Finn| Enough lady!  Hey little girl, are you okay?
Penny|  Please, don't steal anything from me!
Finn| Whoa! We wouldn't do that. We're heroes.
Jake|  We want to turn your frown all the way around. 
Penny| Ahh! 
Finn|  Jake!
Jake| I'll face the other way, but I'm gonna keep doing this.
Finn| So what's wrong?
Penny| Oh, it was terrible. I was trying to sell my flowers out here in the desert, when these two thieves came and stole my whole basket! Then ran into the city.
Finn| The city?
Hag| ...of Thieves!
Jake| Oh boy.
Hag| Heed my warning boy enter the city, and you'll come out a thief!
Finn| Never.  I'll get this girl's flowers back-
Penny| My name is Penny.
Finn| I'll get Penny's flowers back, and come out of that city as pure as the driven snow. Let's go Jake!
Jake| Yeah! We're gonna purify that city!
Finn|  Cool.
Jake|  Crud.
Big Guy| My ring!
Finn|  Stop thief!
Finn|  Stop!
Big Guy|  My ruby!
Finn|  Stop, baby! Don't steal!
Finn|  Don't steal, Mr. Turtle!
Penny|  Finn, it's hopeless to try stopping a thief here. Everyone steals from each other. It's redoodoodiculous!
Finn|  Penny! Never say that!
Penny|  Redoodoodiculous?
Finn|  No! The whole thing you said. About hopelessness. 'Cause I'm gonna get your basket back from whoever took it. And then I'm going to  beat my purity into them!
Jake|  And then I'm gonna beat your purity outta them.  And then beat a sandwich into them!  And then beat them to the punch! And then punch 'em!
Finn|  We can beat these thieves while we search for Penny's flower basket!
Jake|  Okay.
Finn|  Hey turd-le ! I'm gonna kick your butt! Also, have you seen this little girl's flower basket?
Jake|  You're going down, turtle!
Jake|  Woah! I want jets!
Finn|  Come back, Crossbow Guy!
Crossbow Guy|  My crossbow!
Penny|  Hey, my basket! That's my basket!
Finn|  Don't worry, Penny. We'll get it right after I deal with this guy!  Stealing's wrong, doofus!
Penny|   This is fun, Finn!
Two-Headed Thief Head 1|  My bro!
Two-Headed Thief Head 2|  My body!
Cyclops|  I'm gonna steal your flower basket, wizard!
Wizard Thief|  Pancake, pancake, pancake.
Two-Headed Thief Head 2|  Ow, brotha'!
Cyclops|  My glasses!
Phil|  My jammies!
Phil|  My glasses!
Finn|  There it goes!
Finn|  I will smite thee, goblin thief!
Goblin Thief #1|  You stole that basket from me!
Goblin Thief #2|  No I didn't!  Hey! Gimme that! I stole it first! I'll use my sword on you!
Goblin Thief #2|  Hey! 
Finn|   You there! It's time to step into the purification chamber, son!  Hey!
Finn|   How are we supposed to get that basket back if it keeps being stolen?! 
Jake|  Hey! We can steal a new one from that guy!  He's got lots of flower baskets. And boots! I'd like to steal me one of them pairs of boots, especially.
Finn|  No, Jake. We can't steal. We have to stay pure!
Jake|   Okay.
Penny|  I have an idea! My mom used to tell me that there's a King of Thieves who lives in the center of the city, and everything that gets stolen from little girls ends up at his tower. Maybe we'd find my basket in his treasure chest!
Finn|  That's a great idea, Penny!
Penny|  There's one thing, though. The tower that he lives in is surrounded by a magical barrier. Which magically keeps thieves out.
Finn|  Have you forgotten?! We three ain't thieves! We're pure! Right, Jake?  Jake?
Jake|   Just gotta steal these boots...
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|  Huh?
Baskets & Boots owner|   Hey! Go away!
Finn|  What are you doin', man?
Jake| It's the city, it's getting to me. Help me, Finn!
Finn| I'm here for ya buddy. 
Jake| Thank you Finn, thank you.
Finn|  Nooo!  I won't let you become a thief! 
Finn|  Bells. That way, I'll hear you if you try to steal again.
Jake|  Oh. Hmm. 
Penny|  The King of Thieves' tower is right up here.
Finn|  Woah.  You read to pass through, Penny?
Penny|  I'm too afraid! Is it okay if I wait out here?
Finn|  Sure. C'mon, let's go, Jake!
Jake|   Comin'! 
Finn|  Jake, where'd you get those boots?
Jake|  Huh, what? What boots?  Oh, no! I stole! The city! It took advantage of me!
Finn|   Jake, you're a thief now! You won't be able to get in anymore!
Jake|  Yes, I can.  Oh. 
Finn|   It's up to me, now.
Penny|  Legend says you'll find the loot in the King of Thieves' chest. Good luck, Finn! Oh, yeah, and that high window is the only entrance.
Finn|  Hmm. Alright, wish me luck!
Jake|  She already did, man.
Finn|  Oh, yeah. Right.  Great, now I gotta climb down?!  Huh?  The King of Thieves!  Sorry to trespass, I just... Uh, hello?  The chest! In it's in his chest! Thanks! 
Jake|  You see, if you have too much earwax, you won't be able to hear anymore.
Finn|   I got it, guys!
Penny|  The chest! Gimme that! 
Finn|  Huh?
Jake|  Woah, woah, woah. Easy, kid.
Finn|  What?!  Is you basket under all that gold?
Penny|  Of course it's not! I set you up to steal this chest of gold! I couldn't get past the barrier 'cause I'm a thief!
Finn|  But you're just a cute little girl!
Penny|  And, I'm a thief!
Finn|  Well, if this isn't yours, I'm gonna return it right now!  Huh?  Why can't I...?
Penny|  Because you stole something in the city! Now you're a thief!
Finn|  No!  No!!! What have I done?! What have I become?!
Penny|  You've become a thief, stupid! 
Finn|   My hands. They're all dirty. Covered in the dust of a criminal act! I'm a thief!
Hag|  Oh, what did I tell you, boy? This city will get you, no matter how pure you think you are!  I was right.
Jake|  Hey, that's enough from you, Hag!   Finn?
Finn|  Don't touch me! I'm impure, man! Unfit to be a hero! Unfit to be your friend.
Jake|  Come on, Finn, keep it together!
Finn|  No, Jake. This is a one-way path, down a jacked-up road. And I gotta walk it... alone.
Jake|  I'm not gonna leave you alone in the city. You're my buddy. Besides, I stole these boots. These super-big style boots. So I'm just as dirty as you are, Finn. We gotta walk this filthy path together!
Finn|  Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengeance on Penny.
Jake|  Cowabunga! 
Finn|  Cowabunga, indeed.
Penny|   Mmm. Yes. Yeah.  Wha? Is someone there?! 
Finn|   It's me, Penny. The hero whose purity you stole! And I'm here to enact my revenge upon you! 
Jake|  Hi, Penny.
Penny|  Finn, please don't punch my lights out! I'm just a poor, homeless baby girl.
Finn|  I trusted you, Penny. You made me steal. And you took my purity. You ruined me!
Penny|  I'm sorry, Finn.  Let me give you some uh, gems, or some gold, or uh, have some  knife in your neck! 
Jake|  Watch out, Finn! 
Finn|  Thanks, dude.
Jake|  Yeah, dude.
Penny|  You may have soiled my purity, but I think you can still come out clean.  C'mon, Jake! 
Penny|  No! No! 
Jake|  Nice work, dude.
Finn|  She's purified!
Penny|   I feel...clean! Like all the filth of the city and wrongdoings are gone! Thank you F and J! I haven't felt like this since I was young!
Finn|  You're welcome.
Jake|  Woah, dude!  The soap got on us, too!
Finn|  We're clean!
Finn and Jake|  Yes! 
Finn|  This good deed we did has purified us once again. We're virgin islands! 
Penny|  Finn, thanks for the second chance to live a pure life.
Finn|  And you know what that means, Penny. No more stealing! 
Penny|  Never again.
Finn|  Well, I think it's time for us to get the math out of here.
Penny|   I'm going to miss you, Finn!
Finn|  I'll miss you, too.
Penny|   G'bye!
Jake|  Woah, dude. Why are you naked? 
Finn|   PENNY!
Finn|  Our secret mission to capture the Ice King is underway. Though I probably shouldn’t say stuff like that out loud.
Ice King|   Who is it?  Zap zap zap zap zap zap zap!  Ooh, someone left me a gift. Peanut brittle? But I'm on a diet. 
Jake|  Should have stuck to your diet!
Ice King|   Oahh! Finn, you have destroyed my faith in canned peanut brittle! Zap!  Oh, no, my crown has all my powers in it!
Finn|   Wrap attack!
Jake|   How about I swaddle you up like a sweet baby.
Finn|  We finally captured the Ice King!
Jake|   Why'd we do this again?
Finn|  Princess explained it all when she sent us on the mission, remember?
Princess Bubblegum|  Go capture the Ice King, and bring him to me.
Jake|  Hmm… That didn't really explain anything.
Finn|  I'm sure she's got a good reason.
Finn|  Where is everybody?
Jake|  Yeah, this place is deserted, except for that guy.
Princess Bubblegum|  Ich bin hier, Finn. 
Princess Bubblegum|  It's me, the princess. Did you bring him?
Finn|  Sure did.
Finn|  So, what did the Ice King do to—
Princess Bubblegum|   Ah-bababap! No time! Now quickly, with me!
Princess Bubblegum|  Ttubllaw!
Stonesy|  What's the password?
Stonesy|   Oh, you got me! 
Finn & Jake|  Secret door!
Princess Bubblegum|  This stairway leads to the dungeon where we'll toss that lousy Ice King!
Finn|  What awful thing did he do to get tossed in there?
Princess Bubblegum|  Chhh, he didn't do anything. Not a thing.
Finn|  Wha?
Princess Bubblegum|  It's a long story, Finn. You see, the Ice King…
Manfried|   Princess Bubblegum, you're needed at once in the Grand Hall.
Princess Bubblegum|  No! I need more time! 
Manfried|   Gosh, I'm sorry.
Princess Bubblegum|  Alright, alright, I have to go. You two just guard the Ice King until I return  and be prepared to make him howl with pain.
Finn|  You got it, princess!
Ice King|  Oh, this is a total rook!
Jake|  Settle down, prisoner! We gotta record your belongings. One magical crown,  probably stolen.
Ice King| I didn't steal it! I made that item! …Made it with the magic that I stole! So hand it over, or I'll strike menacing poses at you! 
Finn|  Cool it, inmate! 
Ice King|  These bars can't hold me forever! Hey there's only like two of 'em. You fools have no business guarding prisoners.
Finn|  Oh, yeah?! Well how 'bout these helmets we found? And we got the Oculus of Rehabilitation!
Ice King|  Hmm?
Oculus|  Be better!
Finn|  And the shelf of penitence!
Ice King's crown|   I'm sorry…I'm so sorry…
Ice King|  How about you just hand me my crown. I'll create some ice bars.
Jake|   Okay!
Finn|  No, Jake! It's a trick.
Ice King|  I'm toying with you, ha ha, psychologically. 
Finn|  Finished!
Ice King|  So what am I being charged with?
Finn|  Umm…
Jake|  Five counts of jerkateering. Ha!
Finn|  Yeah, what does it matter?
Ice King|  Gah! Of course it matters! The way things work is first, I transgress your meaningless rules and then you maliciously persecute me!
Finn|  That makes sense. You do bad stuff, we punish you.
Ice King|   Fool! You have disrupted that order, for—are you ready for this?—I have committed no recent crime!
Finn|  Really? Umm…
Ice King|   I'm rockin' your worldview!
Finn|  Jake, he is starting to convince me we're doing a bad thing.
Jake|  Dude,  be calmed by my saliva and think of all the terrible things he's done.
Finn|  Yeah… yeah! You're still a jerk that deserves to be in jail.
Ice King|  Oh, yeah? You know who really deserves to be in jail? I will show you the true jerks!  Behold! 
Finn|  Uhh, it's too dark.
Ice King|  Behold!  Wha, Behold!  Behold the true jerks!
Finn|  The jerks are us? Jake, am I going crazy? It seems like the Ice King is right about this. But if he's in the right, that means we're in…
Jake|  The Candy Kingdom!
Finn|  No, it means much, much worse.
Finn|  On your feet.
Ice King|   Is it time for my hour in the yard, boss?
Finn|  No, we're letting you go. We decided that it's wrong to imprison you.
Ice King|  This is a trick, huh?
Finn|  Get out of here before I change my mind!
Ice King|   There must be someone waiting outside to beat me. Ooh, is that my crown over there? 
Jake|   I'm glad that's all taken care of.
Finn|  No, quite yet.
Jake|  Awww…
Finn|  Sorry, but since we're the bad guys this time, we gotta go to jail.
Jake|  This sucks.
Ice King|  Hey!
Ice King|  Get out of my room!
Finn|  You're still he—  …Just get out of here, man!
Ice King|  So, you're really breaking me out?
Finn|  Like I said, it's wrong to imprison you.
Ice King|"   You mean, you believe me? Oh, can it be? Has all the hatred between us transmuted into something more? A friendship? A best friendship.  Knucks?  Oh, ho ho, slaps in disgust, eh? Let's call them ""Slappy D's""! Okay, see you later, my bosoms!"
Finn|  I am no man's bosom.
Ice King|"  Cast ""Detect Secret Door""!  Success!  Wa ha ha ha!"
Princess Bubblegum|  Sorry for the delay.
Jake|  Man, there are a lot of secret door around here.
Princess Bubblegum|   And now, Ice King, prepare to howl with  pain?
Finn|  Wow, she's so proud we did the right thing, she almost looks enraged.
Princess Bubblegum|   Where is the Ice King?
Ice King|  Finally! Freedom and friends FOREVER!!!
Princess Bubblegum|  What... have... you... DONE?!?! 
Finn|  What have we done?
Princess Bubblegum|  I'LL SHOW YOU. 
Finn|  AHHH!!!
Starchie|  Heah, even old Starchie's sick.
Princess Bubblegum|  A plague of Freezer Burn Flu.
Finn|  Ice King did this?
Princess Bubblegum|  Well, yes and no.
Princess Bubblegum|   It happened 3 days ago.
Ice King|  Hey, hey, Princess, check out my new trick!  It's snowing it's snowing for you!
Princess Bubblegum|   We don't think he was trying to spread disease, but soon the entire kingdom was infect by his beard flakes.
Princess Bubblegum|   Through my research, I quickly discovered that the only way to cure my people was to obtain the pained howls of the Ice King himself.
Princess Bubblegum|   But when I pleaded with him directly…
Princess Bubblegum|  Please, I beseech your aid. In the name of common decency!
Ice King|  So let me get this straight… You're hitting on me.
Princess Bubblegum|  No!
Lady Rainicorn|  으으, 웃기시네! 너는 우리 공주님과 판결 상대도 안 될 그런 가치없는 놈이야! 
Ice King|"  I think I heard the word ""Virile"" in there. Oh, she is definitely hitting on me."
Princess Bubblegum|  No!
Lady Rainicorn|  말도 안 돼! 
Ice King|  Be gone, you biddies!
Princess Bubblegum|   He had his chance to help and he did nothing!
Ice King|  Oh, my gosh, she came to me this time.
Princess Bubblegum|  I had no choice but to try and take his wails by force.
Jake|  By getting us to beat the tar out of him.
Finn|  I can't just beat up the Ice King for nothing. That's against my alignment.
Princess Bubblegum|  I know, I know. You're right. 
Finn|  But I'll get him to give up those howls. Voluntarily. I swear it.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, thank you, Finn. I… 
Finn|   Shhhh…
Jake|  Dude, how are we gonna get those howls?
Finn|  Oh, I gotta plan to trick him, but you won't like it.
Jake|  That sounds ominous. I don't like it!
Finn|  Ice King, come forth!
Ice King|  I'm coming forth! Hee hee, is that the voice of friendship I hear?  So, are you fellas ready for game night?
Finn|  Game night? Well, that's weird.
Ice King|  What? Why?
Finn|  You do know how friends act, right? You've had friends before.
Ice King|  I… yes?
Finn|  Yeah, so you know how friends are always howling in pain for each other.
Ice King|  Yeah… right! Everyone knows that! 
Finn|   Will you howl for me, pal?
Ice King|  Oooh, of course, friend. Awoo-hehehehe! Oh, I've got the sillies! I couldn't possibly without giggling uncontrollably. I'm just so giddy about you being here!  I'm a banana!  Don't slip on me!
Jake|  We're out of options. Let's just beat it out of him.
Finn|  No, Jake! We…
Ice King|   Wait a sec, there's a bug on you, friend. Smack! 
Finn|  Grrr… Biscuits, now's my chance!
Ice King|   You know, I carved these game pieces from my own teeth.
Finn|  Boo hoo, boo hoo, boo hoo, boo hoo…
Ice King|  Huh? Crying?!
Finn|  Boo hoo. You hit me, Ice King. I don't think I could live any more knowing my best bosom hit me.
Ice King|  I was only saving you from poo poo palms!
Finn|  I'm dying because I know you care not for me. 
Ice King|  No! No, my…my bosom! What hath I done?! My friend!  My only friend.
Jake|  Hey, what about me?
Ice King|  Why?! Why?! WHY?!!!
Starchie|  Starchie's feeling healthy again!  A bit too healthy if you ask me.
Princess Bubblegum|  They're all getting better! Finn and Jake did it! Ich bin so glücklich, ich könnte, ich könnte…  
Ice King|  WHY?!!!… Ah, well. Gunter! Dispose of Finn's carcass.
Finn|   Harumph.
Jake|  Good job! Those wails must have reached all the way to…
Finn|  Did you see how fast he dropped my lifeless body? That's just mean.
Jake|  Finn, if I came across your lifeless body, I'd clasp you dramatically for a kajillion years.
Finn|  Thanks, man.
Jake|   Hey, why wait?! Play dead, Finn!
Jake|  Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?! Heh heh heh heh. Why?!
Finn & Jake|  Adventure time!
Candy Children|  Whoa-a-a!
Candy Child| That was awesome!
Candy Child 2| Lets go over there!
Candy Children| Whe-e-e-e!
Candy Child 3| Come on! Come on!
Candy children| Wow! Yay! Whee!
Candy Child| Whoa-a-a!
Finn| Hmm. Why would I need to learn about caterpillar families? I don't get it.
Jake| Well, they look like they're having fun.
Finn|  Real leaves aren't made out of candy. They always have a gross, bitter taste.
Candy Child| Whee! 
Candy Child| Terry eats all the caterpillars!
Candy Child 2| Mmm! Ah, it's so good!
Finn| Ugh. That's gross, too. There's no way real caterpillars are delicious.
Jake| You think? I bet they taste great if you're a boid.
Princess Bubblegum| The caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird. The big bird then dies, and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues. This is a law of nature we call the food chain.
Princess Bubblegum| Isn't that fascinating?
Candy Child| Yo, Princess Bubblegum, do birds play football?
Princess Bubblegum| No, Terry. They don't. 
Candy Child|  That's weak, Ma'am.
Candy Child 2| You guys, this is lame.
Finn| No way I'm eating a bug's butt. Those kids are right. Whats the big deez about the food chain, anyway? Lets hit the snack bar and eat something yummy.
Finn| Hey, this is pretty fun!
Jake| Hey, have you noticed we are birds now?
Finn| I'm hungies.
Jake| Look over there. That oasis looks pretty good to me.
Jake| Bon appetit!
Finn| Oh, dude, you ate those?!
Jake| Come on, man. We're sweet, sweet birds, and we get to eat worms. This is a unique experience.
Finn|  Uh, how did I get so mad chubs? I only ate one grub.
Jake| Dude, you've been eating grubs for hours.
Finn| What?!
Jake| Yeah, you're a beast.
Finn| Help me, Jake! My body's too bloated to fly!
Jake| Hide!
Finn|  There goes my din-din. Why am I hungry again?
Finn| Jake!
Jake| Who are you?
Finn| It's me, Finn.
Jake| Dang, when did you get so big?... And old?
Jake| You feeling okay, bro?
Finn| Jake, we are good friends. So let me just say you look awesome right now.
Jake| Ha, really?
Finn| Yeah.
Finn| You're looking tasty.  Hey, why don't you take a seat in my mouth?
Jake| Why? That's... weird.
Finn| It's okay. It's okay. Just give it a try. It's a new experience, right?
Jake| Wow, you have a lot of saliva.  You must have a broken pipe, old timer. It's comfy, though.
Jake| Whoa! Did you just try to eat me?!
Finn| No...? But if I did that'd be okay, right?
Jake| You are trying to eat me.
Finn| I'm just following the Law of Nature.
Jake| What're you talking about?
Finn| I don't know. I just feel that way. 
Finn| Aw, Jake, you're missing out... by not getting eaten... by me.
Jake| Sorry, man. I'm not into it.
Finn| So alone. So hungry.  The Law of Nature... has claimed this... bod... 
Finn| Yay! What a big turnout. Top notch! To decompose stuff! Yeah-h-h! We are so pumped! Yeah!  What's that smell?
Finn| Wow. It looks amazing! Yay! Yay!
Finn| Party time!
Finn| So good! Awesome. This bird went bad so well!
Jake| You took it too far, man. I'm a dog, and I eat all kinds of horrible things. This is disgusting.
Finn|" Come on, think of it as a conversation starter—like, ""The other night, I ate the grossest thing I've ever tasted."" You know, it's interesting. "
Finn| Whew! I'm full.
Finn| Whoa! Aah!
Finn| Whoa! Aah! Whoa! Aah! What's going on?! Whoa!
Finn| I think we're safe now... and also caterpillars.
Jake| We're still in a bind, man. No food, no water.
Finn| I'm hungry.
Jake| I'm thirsty.
Jake|  Hey, look.
Jake| It's another caterpillar.
Jake| Huh? You okay? 
Finn| She's beautiful.
Jake| She's just a caterpillar, dude.
Jake| Looks like she's gonna faint.
Jake| You see?
Jake|" Huh. ""Love is Blind""—that must apply to all species."
Jake| Oh, I see. Your name is Erin, and there's a famine near your town, so that's why you're out here searching for an oasis.
Erin| Yes, I have to hurry and find food. Otherwise, my family won't survive.  But I don't know if I can go on... 
Finn| Hold on, Erin. Food! Water! Shade! Where are you?!
Jake| Over there—the oasis!
Finn|  Yummy!
Jake| Really? You like leaves now?
Finn| So good, dude.
Finn|  Your eyes.
Jake| Hey, hey, hey, move over a bit. I got a rhythm going here.
Erin| I've never been this happy.
Jake|   This oasis is pretty romantic, huh?
Erin| Sure, I guess.
Jake| So, how many kids you want to have?
Finn| Uh,  d-d-do you want to get married?
Erin| Yes!
Jake| And will you, Finn, take this caterpillar to be your wife, even if she becomes a flower or a bird or a bacteria, to love and to cherish till death do you part?
Finn| Y-y-y-yes.
Jake| You may now kiss the bride.
Finn| This way, Erin!
Caterpillar| Hey, is that my butt? Man, it's been a while!
Erin| Finn!
Finn| When we're reborn as caterpillars, I'll marry you all over again!
Erin| That's beautiful, Finn! But when we're bacteria, I might see other people!
Jake| Hey, why are you eating caterpillars?
Finn| My eyes are open.
Princess Bubblegum| The caterpillar eats the leaf. Then the bird eats the caterpillar. Then the big bird eats the little bird then dies and its remains decompose into rich, fertile soil. And from that soil, a new plant bursts to life. And then the caterpillar eats the plant again. And so the circle of life continues.
Candy Child 2| Eh, so what? Let's go play.
Candy Child 3| Yeah, weirdo.
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn? Finn? Finn! Where are you? I need you to try this!
Finn|  I'll be there in a sec! 
Jake|  What's the status?
Finn|  Good, man!
Jake|  Nice! Seal the deal, bro!
Finn|   Okay, man! Whatevs!
Jake|  You can do it, you hear me?!  I'm playin' BMO—call me later, bye! 
BMO|  How's Finn's date?
Jake|  I think it's goin' good.
BMO|  Unlike your game, boiiiii!
Jake|  Where's the key to the tower, BMO?! Tell me! AAAGH!
Finn|  Okay, Finn. She's 13; you're 13. Just have fun! Be yourself.  Wooooo!
Finn|  What's that? Are you trying to make yourself 18 again?
Princess Bubblegum|  Nah. This is an instant bath serum. It makes you sweat cleaning agents.
Finn|  I don't bathe. I want that!
Finn|  WAAAUGH! Hot, hot, oh—WAAAAUGH! Oh... so spice! So spice!
Princess Bubblegum|   YOU'RE so spice!
Manfried|  Bwaaa bwaaa bwaaaaaa!  Announcing the arrival of the Earl of Lemongrab!
Cinnamon Bun|  Heh hah hah- AAAAUGH! Oof! Ha ha ha!

Princess Bubblegum|  Wait, wait! You can't give orders like that! I'm in charge here, Lemongrab!
Earl of Lemongrab|   TOO YOUNG! TOO YOUNG TO RULE THE KINGDOM!

Finn|  What the huh?
Earl of Lemongrab|  MMMM!  HAH!  I am next in line to thee throne! Sooo... I will be in charge... UNTIL PRINCESS BUBBLEGUM turns... 18 again!
Finn|  That's bunk! Right, Preebos?
Princess Bubblegum|  No... He is rightful ruler under kingdom law. It's complicated.  I created Lemongrab.
Finn|  
Princess Bubblegum|  He was the first of my experiments gone wrong...
Earl of Lemongrab|  Nnnnnnuh!
Earl of Lemongrab|  Gaaaaaah!
Earl of Lemongrab|  EEEEEEAAAAAAGH!
Princess Bubblegum|  
Princess Bubblegum|  ... And now that I'm younger than him, he inherits the right to the throne.
Earl of Lemongrab|  IF ANYONE NEEDS ME I'LL BE TAKING A NAP! A...a-a-and CLEAN this place up or dungeon! THREE HOURS DUNGEON!
Starchie|  Who are you talking to?!
Earl of Lemongrab|  THREE! HOURS! DUNGEON!
Starchie|   NNNNOOOOOOOO!!!
Finn|  We'll see you in a few hours... okay, Starchie?
Starchie|   Yeah, right... If Starchie ever survives that long...
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, this is dirt balls! We gotta do something to make him leave!
Finn|  Yeah... like pranking him up his face!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey, yeah! And I have the perfect prank! C'mon, Finn!
Earl of Lemongrab|"   Huh?  ""You... really... smell... like... ... dog buns""...?"
Earl of Lemongrab|  NNNUUUUuuuuuooooooooooOOOOOOOOUUUUUUGGGGHHH!!!
Earl of Lemongrab|  Well, well, well... IS THIS EVERYONE, THEN?!
Peppermint Butler|  Yes, all the castle staff.
Earl of Lemongrab|  Sooo which one of yooou WAS it?! Who did... the THING?!
Upside-Down Ice Cream Cone|  The... thing?
Earl of Lemongrab|   FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU-- —UUUMMMM!!!  THE THING, THE THING!!!
Peppermint Butler|  Hey, man! Calm down!  It's just a prank, man! For laughs!
Earl of Lemongrab|  Prank? F... for... laughs?  Yes, of course... Just a harmless prank... f-for laughs... Ahhh...  HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAH- OH! HAOAHOAHAOAHOAHAOAHAOHAO
Peppermint Butler|  Heh, heh...
Earl of Lemongrab|   HAHAHAOAHAHAOAAHA-  Twelve years dungeon.  All of you—dungeon! Seven years, no trials!  C'mon... LET'S MOVE IT!!!
Princess Bubblegum|   I don't think that worked out too math, Finn.
Finn|  What? No, no! He just needs some more prankin's to finish the job! He'll leave the kingdom. Let's try it my way this time, okay?
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay!
Earl of Lemongrab|  OOF!
Earl of Lemongrab|   Cough, cough!  Oooooh...  Ha, ha-ha... GOOD ONE!  Keep 'em coming! I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE!!! Ho... ha... Ah-ah-oooow!
Finn|  I got a new plan!
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, yeah? What?
Finn|"  We'll work together and use that serum you made. The one that was ""Ah! So Spice!"" And spice-bomb him non-stop 'till his butt falls out! How's that sound?"
Princess Bubblegum|  
Finn|  Hoooo! 
Peppermint Butler|  Thank you for releasing me early from the dungeon, Master Lemongrab.
Earl of Lemongrab|  I determine what is early, and what is late, Mr. Peppermint! 
Peppermint Butler|  Yes, Your Earlness.
Earl of Lemongrab|  Also... I don't know where food comes from! 
Peppermint Butler|  My Lord, food comes from Ma--
Earl of Lemongrab| AHHHHtatatataNO!! That's why I am royal and you are servile!
Finn|  You ready to pour the stuff?
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeah! I made it super-hot this time!
Finn|  Wait 'till he opens the lid!
Peppermint Butler|  Behold a plate of mashed carrots, flavor--
Princess Bubblegum|  Shoot!
Peppermint Butler|  HHHHAAAAAAA!!! HAAAAAAA! HAAAAAAA!!!! AAAAAAAGHAAA!!!!!
Finn|  Shh!
Earl of Lemongrab|   STOP SCREAMING!!! WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING?!
Peppermint Butler|  Because I'm excited by this meal I made!
Earl of Lemongrab|  Me, too. I'm excited, too.
Earl of Lemongrab|  HHHHUUUUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
Peppermint Butler|  He's eating the dirt! SPICE IT NOW!
Peppermint Butler|  He's heading for the orchard!
Earl of Lemongrab|  Apple!
Earl of Lemongrab|  Mmmm!
Finn|  Heh, heh... heh! 
Earl of Lemongrab|  OOOOOONE MILLION YEEEEEEEARS, DUNGEON!!!!
Finn|  Maybe if we... set his butt on fire.
Princess Bubblegum|  No, Finn... There's only one way. I just didn't want to have to do it. If I change myself back to my real age, I can reclaim the throne.
Finn|  What? No! I mean... you can do that?
Princess Bubblegum|  
Finn|  Then... why did you wait so long?
Princess Bubblegum|  Because being 13 again is... Bloobaloobie!
Finn|  Hm?
Princess Bubblegum|  While being 18 is all plock dumps and wagglezags... I never really get to act like a kid. But, it's okay. Really. My people need me, and that comes first!
Finn|  Yeaaah...
Princess Bubblegum|  First thing we need is more candy flesh to increase my biomass. But I need my lab equipment to engineer it.
Peppermint Butler|  Not necessarily, milady!
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, thank you! Thank you, all! Okay... Next we need a bonding agent.
Finn|  Princess? I think I can help.
Finn|  Finished!
Princess Bubblegum|  There's one last thing we need.  Only the heat from a whopping love hug can catalyze the re-age-ifying process.
Finn|   Are you ready, Princess?
Princess Bubblegum|  Yes, Finn. But... first, I just want to say how much fun I've had hanging out with you.
Finn|  Me, too!
Princess Bubblegum|  And I... I wish I could stay... like this, with you, but--
Finn|  I... I know, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum|  'Scuse, me, Finn.  Yo, Earl!
Earl of Lemongrab|   WHAAAAAT?!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey! You're fired, ya BUTT!
Earl of Lemongrab|  HHHHHRRRRRGGGRRRUUGGHHH!!!!!
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm so glad everything's back to normal. Thanks for all your help, Finn.
Finn|  Oh- you're welcome! But... uhm...
Princess Bubblegum|  What is it, Finn?
Finn|  Well, ah... Do you... do you wanna hug some more?
Princess Bubblegum|  What? Finn, you silly! That was, like, five years ago! You really gotta move on.
Finn|  Oh- yeah, yeah... Sorry...
Princess Bubblegum|  Such a silly boy.
Finn|  Hello?
Jake|  Hey, man! What's the status?
Finn|  Bad news, man... I... I got dumped.
Jake|  Awww. I'm sorry, Finn. But look, man. Lemme share with you a little secret on how to win the heart of a princess. It's not easy, but ya have to be persistent. You might have to defeat a demon lord, and warp through several worlds.
Jake|  But once you do, you walk up the wizard stairs, and produce your magic key you got in a water world and unlock the chamber door. Then, walk right up to the princess, and give her a smooch.
Jake|  Yesss!  Does that make sense?
Finn|  Yeah, man. I see what you're sayin'. Thanks, Jake.
Jake|  Mmm-hmm.
Finn|   Go up the wizard steps.
Normal Man| Hey, how's it going up there? Have you made visual confirmation with Glob?
Tiny Manticore|  Shut... you... This is freaking har—!
Normal Man| Come again? You're breaking up. Make sure you tell Glob it's me who sent you. Tell him we're coming for Grod, Grob, and Gob, also! I believe in you, little guy!
Tiny Manticore| You can keep your little guys in your—aarrgh! What the freak am I doing?!
Normal Man| Come again?
Tiny Manticore| Nothing. Never mind.  Oh, crud. There... he... is!
Glob| Who's that? Dark off.
Normal Man| Whoa!
Tiny Manticore| I... got... you! 
Glob| Uh-oh, don't pass out, man. Hey, wake up. Hey.
Tiny Manticore| What?
Normal Man|  Pull up! Pull up!
Tiny Manticore| Oh, right.  I did it! I have your brother, Magic Man!
Normal Man|" It's ""Normal Man"" now."
Tiny Manticore| Yes... powerless... Normal Man.
Normal Man| Bring him here, Tiny!
Tiny Manticore| No.
Normal Man| Wh—Wh—Huh? What is this?
Tiny Manticore| It's a classic double-cross, bozo!
Glob| Brother, tell this animal to put me back in space.
Tiny Manticore| You messed with me for years! Now it's my turn to mess with you! 
Finn| Hey, Jake. You need help with demma Eggs Benedict inna demma hollandaise sauce?
Jake|  Get over here, dude.
Finn| Yo, no dogs on the table. Shoo! Get down, boy! Whatcha see, boy? Show daddy.
Jake| I do see something, but you're making it weird.
Finn| Sorry bro. What's going on.
Jake|  Look.
Finn| Whoa. Hey, you! scram!
Jake|  Yeah, beat it Magic Man!
Normal Man| Oh, hey.
Jake| Got him!
Finn|  Uhh.. is he dead?
Jake| Nah, he's magic.
Finn| Dude, he lost his powers, remember?
Jake| Oh, right.  Uh-oh.
Finn and Jake| Phew!
Finn| Come on. Let's bring him inside, you murderler.
Normal Man| Finn and Jake! I need your help!
Finn| Why would we help you, Magic Man?
Normal Man| It's Normal Man, and it's not helping me. It's helping my brother, Glob.
Finn|   Whaaaaaa?
Normal Man| That's where Tiny Manticore took Glob -- to the very top of Wild Trap Mountain.
Tiny Manticore| Come on, fool! Come on. Get spanked!
Normal Man| Tiny always liked you guys.
Jake| That's because we freed him from your sick nightmare house.
Normal Man| Maybe he'll listen to you and not hurt Glob. This could be my chance to make things right between us, go back to Mars and run things how we used to, before I threw everyone under the bus.
Finn| Like when you made them all go bald or something?
Glob| Magic Man, stop this nonsense immediately.
King of Mars| Aah! Magic Man! As soon as I break these magic bonds, you're going straight to Ooo on that bus, you hear me?!
Magic Man| Magic Man! Have some of these bangers, why don't ya? Bang! 
King of Mars| What's that? Oh, no! Aah!
Magic Man| Just a few more laps and I'll break the jerk world record.
Normal Man| You know what, guys? I'll just go up there and let Tiny margle me off a cliff. It'll be good for Glob to see his trash brother eat it finally.
Jake| What do you think about that?
Finn| No. Glob's your brother, and brothers always care about each other, even if one of them is a terrible deuce breakfast like you. So let's stretch up this thing and talk it out with Tiny.
Normal Man| WAIT! It's called Wild Trap Mountain for a reason. Look. Normal-size manticores. Carnivore plants. Camouflage rock beasts. Mind-control parasites. Archer bandits that'll shoot you straight out of the sky. This one quiet dude nobody messes with. A dragon ghost. Red ants. Weekend survivalists. Waking dream demons. That squirrel that hates you, Jake.
Jake| Who?
Finn| We get it. We got to stealth it up there.
Normal Man| Oh, ouch, my knees.
Finn| Shh!
Luke| Hey, Jonah.
Jonah| Hey, Luke. What's going on today?
Luke| Freaking nothing yet.
Jonah| I know. I just want to kill and eat someone already.
Jake| Phew! Well, we got past those guys.
Finn| Easy greasy. You doing okay, Normal Man?
Normal Man­| Easy grea‐‐
Finn­| What?
Jake­| Aah!
Squirrel­| I know that voice!
Finn­| Charge!
Camouflage Rock Beast­| Surprise, you're dead!
Finn­| Go, go,go, go, go, go!
Jake­| Finn?
Normal Man| Parasite!
Finn­| What the heck?
Jake­| To the top! Wait!  Almost there!
Normal Man­| Don't bother that guy.
Normal Man| Wow.  Ouch! Freakin' red ants!
Red Ant­| Get off my mountain!
A weekend survivalist­|  Aah, my dreams! I'm having daymares!
Jake­| There's the top!
Squirrel­|  Jake! It's me!
Jake­| Who?
Jake­| My eyes! Sorry.
Normal Man­| Ahh! Tiny Manticore! Please! Don't hurt my brother!
Glob| This guy is really freaking me out.
Tiny Manticore­| Yes! Hello, Normal Man. Come and greet the dawning of your grimmest day! How ironic that you, who once trapped me, are now about to royally bite it. You stand at the mercy of my boomerang and flamethrower!
Normal Man ­| I know I really messed you up, but Glob has nothing to do with this. Kill me instead. I'll let you do it.
Tiny Manticore­| Why do you sound so insincere?
Normal Man ­| That's just my voice.
Finn­| Normal Man's telling the truth.
Jake­| Yeah!
Tiny Manticore­| Finn and Jake? I respect you guys a ton, but I have trained for this vengeance for months! I must seize this sparkling moment full in grasping hand!  Boomerang!
Normal Man| What's even a boomerang? Oh, my gosh. I've been calling them something different my whole life.
Tiny Manticore­­| I'm sorry, Jake! I'm just doing me right now. We're still cool, though?
Finn| Not no more!
Jake| Kick his tiny butt.
Normal Man| Aah!
Normal Man| Gah! I hate this mountain.
Finn­| Boomerang!  Watch out for when it ‐‐Oof.
Tiny Manticore­­| Two boomerangs! Could it be? My moment approacheth? Steady hand, steady heart.
Glob| Look out, dude.
Tiny Manticore­­| Whoa! Can I just have this?
Finn| Uh‐oh. Hang on like hot snot, Normal Man!
Normal Man| Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Tiny Manticore­­| Let go! We're going to fall. I'm not very big. I ‐‐ Uh...Okay. Upon reassessment, this is actually a great situation for me!
Tiny Manticore­­|  Farewell, Magic Man! By my hand, I soar free!
Finn­|  Boy‐yay‐moy! Jake!
Jake­|  What? I'm coming! I got to save the dude.
Finn­| No planes! Never planes!
Normal Man| Glob, are you okay?
Glob| Why did you rescue me?
Normal Man| I wanted to bring you back to Mars. They need a ruler up there, and I wanted to apologize for being such a beanshow for hundreds of years.
Glob| Whoa. What? Maybe you really have changed.
Tiny Manticore­| Yeah, right! I'm following to watch you die.
Glob| You know what, though, Magic Man? I've been doing a lot of thinking up in orbit. I shouldn't have shut you out when you got exiled to Ooo. In some ways, I, too, was a total beanshow.
Normal Man| I guess neither of us were perfect brothers.
Glob| Although you were much, much worse.
Normal Man| So, what now? Are we straight up just going to die?
Normal Man| I guess so. Sorry.
LSP­| So, your profile said you were into music. That's crazy, so am I!
Lemongrab| It's stressing me out that there's food on a blanket! I have to go home. This was nice. You're running away from intimacy! You don't know you'd get hurt!
Normal Man| Tiny? What are you doing?
Tiny Manticore­ ­| I could not go through with my vengeance. It wouldn't have accomplished anything. Also, you and your brother are really sweet together.
Normal Man| You're hard to track. But okay!
Finm­| We'll get down ourselves, guys. Don't even sweat it!
Tiny Manticore­­|  But, yeah, let's hang out sometime. I'm getting a phone soon.
Normal Man| Bye! Ready to go home?
­| Whoa, dang.
Normal Man| Oh, the people of Mars are gonna be so glad to see you. It really feels good to be good, you know? Maybe that's my new catchphrase. I don't know. Is that dumb?
Glob| It's a good catchphrase. You'll do okay up there. 
Normal Man| Ahh! Glob, what are you doing?!
Glob| My days of ruling Mars are over, but you got this, man.
Normal Man| All right. Well...
Gob­| Oh, my Gob. Where were you?
Glob| I was with Normal Man. He's cool now.
Gob­| Whaaaaa?I don't believe it.
Normal Man| Hey, guys. I'm back.
Martians, in union| Magic Man!
Martian 1­| Oh! He came back!
Martian 2| Oh, I can't believe it!
Normal Man| It's okay. Calm down.
Martian 3, who is a giant starfish­| Calm down?! You turned me into a giant starfish!
Martian 4, who is a flaming garbage­| You turned me into a barrel of flaming garbage!
Martian 3­| What horrible trick do you have planned now?
Normal Man| I don't really do tricks anymore. Hmm. Okay. Here's a trick. It's a hat but inside it are... brownies!
Martian 4­| I want to eat those brownies.
Normal Man| It's a start.
Wildberry Princess|  My arm!
Turtle Princess|  My face!
Skeleton Princess|  This happens sometimes...
Finn|  Wait... what?!
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, my gosh! How many times do I have to tell you? Somebody broke into my house and stole my lumps!
Finn|  Peebo?
Princess Bubblegum|   Hey, someone stole half of my face.
Jake|  Eeeeeugh...
Finn|  Eh...okay, calm down...
Lumpy Space Princess|  How am I supposed to calm down?! A lumping thief is out there getting fresh with my lumps!
Jake|  Haha, gross.
Finn|  Whoa! Gals... we'll find this crazy freak and return all of your body parts!
Hot Dog Princess|  Thank you so much, Finn!  I should give you a kiss!
Finn|  It's... it's okay, Hot Dog Princess! We'll be right back.
Ice King|"  I said, ""I don't know!"" I have nothing to do with this!"
Jake|  Stop lying! We found your fingerprints at the crime scene!
Ice King|   What? Really?
Jake|  Uuh... no.
Ice King|  Oh, well...then...why would you say that?
Finn|  Ice King, we know you did it!
Ice King|  Finn, I'm as concerned as you are. There's some sicko out there... What if he comes after my princess?
Finn & Jake|  Your princess?
Ice King|  Yeah... let me introduce you to my new wife.  Oh, wait...you mean I'm the guy stealing all the p— Yeah, okay, I get it now.
Princess Monster Wife|  What happened to them, husband?
Ice King|  Hmmm... mmm aah! They're sleepy. They are our limp sleepy children! Come on wife, let's have a nice family meal.
Princess Monster Wife|  Okay.
Ice King|  Wife, you sit here. Isn't this nice?
Ice King|  Uh oh... I mean, that's good!  Oops! How fun! You're so fun!
Princess Monster Wife|  Hahahahaha!
Ice King|  Aww... marriage is fun!
Ice King|  See, when you wash and I dry, we get done faster! Then tomorrow night we switch!
Ice King|  Here, let me show you a trick, my darling. See, you let it soak and we'll wash it in the morning.
Ice King|  Enough chores... come along, dear. I want to show you something special...
Ice King|  Here it is. I hope you like it...
Princess Monster Wife|  Is there something wrong with me? The way I am...it's not normal... is it?
Ice King|  Oh... pretty baby wife. You're the most normal thing in my whole life. We're like two normal jelly beans sitting at the bottom of the jar, floating in a sea of olives, waiting for somebody to guess how many jelly beans are in the jar... which I mentioned.
Princess Monster Wife|  I don't think I understand...
Ice King|  Just look into my eyes and know that everything is okay.
Ice King|  Are you feeling normal yet?  Okay.  See that? We're normal, just like the normal people are.
Princess Monster Wife|  Oh...
Jake|  Lady don't take my pizza....
Finn|  What's h— Oww... 
Finn|  A mo-mo-mons-mo.....
Jake|  Finn? What's— Are you saying Mama? Where'd you— 
Princess Monster Wife|  Hi there!
Jake|   Monster!
Ice King|  Oh... don't mind the kids! It's just a phase!
Princess Monster Wife|  I need a glass of water.
Ice King|  Ooh, I'll go get—
Princess Monster Wife|  No, it's okay. I'll get it.
Princess Monster Wife|  You are not normal! You are a  monster!
Ice King|   Hey, hey, hey....
Princess Monster Wife|  Monster! A monster!
Ice King|  What's going on in here? Nobody's a monster! All I see in this room is a young, kind-hearted, intelligent, hot-looking ice king, and his beautiful princess bride! That's you, sweetie...
Princess Monster Wife|  I don't feel beautiful. I feel like a freak!
Ice King|  I will prove to you that you are beautiful!
Ice King|  To me, my penguins! Gunter, Gunther, Gunder, Goonder, come on! Gunter, Goonthy, Gonter, Ginthy, follow!
Ice King|  Don't rearrange the chairs please. You're all gonna clap and cheer or I'm gonna smack your buns.  Whoo! Yeah! ...
Finn|  If we look at her with these mirrors, her ugliness will have no effect on us.
Jake|  Where is she? Oh! I think she's right over...
Ice King|  Hey!
Ice King|  Baby, do you want to talk about it?
Princess Monster Wife|  You should just find another princess to marry. I'm unlovable!
Ice King|  Girl, I love you as much as all of the other princesses in the world combined!
Princess Monster Wife|  You don't really mean that...
Ice King|  I'll prove it! See, you have Elbow Princess's hips, and Dr. Princess's heart and intestines, Slime Princess's bottom... You have all my favorite parts of my favorite princesses!
Princess Monster Wife|   I'm just a bunch of stolen parts?!
Ice King|  Oh, the parts don't matter. It's you that matters.
Princess Monster Wife|  But... who am I?
Ice King|  You're my wife! And I will always love my wife no matter what!
Princess Monster Wife|  You'd love me, even without these other princess's parts?
Ice King|  Sure, baby, even without all your fine lady parts. Now give us a hug.
Finn|  Hey, Ice King!
Jake|  Your wife's face can't make us faint anymore!
Ice King|  Don't listen to them babe; they're being negative! Run, my happiness! I'll distract them with ice magic!
Jake|  Ouch.
Finn|  Do you give up?!
Ice King|  Yes! I give up...
Jake|  Finally... let's get those princess parts back to the ladies.
Finn|  Yeah, mans. Wait... where'd your wife go?
Finn|  Huh?
Ice King|  Let me go! Let me go!
Princess Monster Wife's spirit|  Though my parts be scattered, I will always be your wife.
Ice King|  She... she... gave away all my stuff!
Finn|" What... is the meaning of ""soup""?"
Jake| What? I don't know. What's with all the weird quest—?
Finn|" What... is the meaning of ""spoon""?"
Jake| Shoot, man, are you still lady-sad about Flame Princess? Y'know, it's okay if you are.
Finn| Naw, that's all fine. I just been feeling kind of... gray, is all. Like my inside voice has been kinda quiet lately. Not a lot of instructions forthcoming, y'know?
Jake| Yeah, well, sounds like you're sad. Listen, Finn, girls is like horses. When you fall down, it's important that you get right back on again—on a different horse. And there's a lot of fish in the sea. A lot of fish. A penny saved is a penny earned.
Finn| Yeah, I-I guess. Or maybe dating girls is like riding a bicycle.
Jake| Yeah, man, yeah!
Finn| Or, like, if you mess up, you could get really hurt forever, or hurt someone you really care about.
Jake| Eh, well, I suppose. Anyway, I hope this mystery cave we're looking for is as weird as Flambo's brother says it is. Maybe that'll snap you out of the— Whoa! What?!
Jake| What's this train all about? No one said nothing about no train in the way!
Finn| Relax, buddy. We'll just cross after it passes. No big thing, really.
Jake| Oh, yeah.
Jake| It's two hours later now. What the stunk?  Oh, okay.  Hey, the train just goes in a big circle! We can cut right through the middle, blingle, blongle, blungle! Come on!  Wha-hey! You know, I just had another idea! If we just stay put here on the train, we could ride it all the way to the cave.  Blingle, blongle, blungle!
Creature| Gimme! Gimme the loot! 
Finn| Ow!
Finn| Yeeow!
Creature| Gimme! Gimme that hat! 
Finn| Knock it off! 
Creature| Aah!
Creature| Oh, dang!
Jake| Hey, Finn!
Finn| Whoa!
Jake| Look at all the loot that guy dropped while you whipped his butt!
Finn| Dang, look at that sword!  Whoa. Feels kinda right.  Whoosh. Whoosh. Vvsh, vvsh.   Whoa!
Jake|  Pretty fun, huh?
Finn| Yeah, man! It's spicy baby fun!
Jake| You wanna go see what other kind of monsters are on this train?
Finn| Yes! 
Jake|  
Finn| Whoa, Crystal Ants, I think! 
Jake|  Cool!  
Finn| Ha-ha! Yeah!  Die, die, die, die, die, die, die! 
Jake|   Welcome back, buddy.
Finn| Man, look at all this rad loot!
Jake| Yeah, this is a pretty neat train. We should come back again someday.
Finn| Whoa, what do you mean? We just started only, like, three hours ago.
Jake| Heheh, yeah. I'm just gettin' a little bored, is all. All these cars of monsters are kinda all the same. It's a little boring.
Finn| Oh, come on.  It's fun! Just one more car. Come on.  Come on, man!  Come on!
Jake| All right, just one more.
Finn| Ha-ha, yes!
Finn| Hmm? Where is everybody?
Jake| Hey, hey! Empty car—think we beat it, buddy.
Finn| Whoa, man! Boss battle! Let's chew it up! 
Jake| Okay, but this is the last one, okay?
Finn| We'll see!
Finn| Ha-ha!
Jake| Hey, man,  you remember we were going to that weird cave? Bet it's not too late to check it out.
Finn|  Eh, weird cave, weird train—I'm cool here.
Jake|  Okay.
Finn| Hyah! 
Head| Ahhhh, gimme a break!
Finn| Oh? Oh, dang. Boss loot!  Oh, yeah. 
Jake| No, thank you.
Finn| Jake, hurry. Next car!
Finn| Slime crimes! 
Jake| You have fun. I'm just gonna watch. 
Finn|  Hey.
Finn| Ow!  Ow. Cool... acid!
Jake| Hey, also, man, aren't you, like, gettin' kinda hungry?
Finn| Yeah, man. I guess we've been here for a while.
Jake| More than a while, dude. I've already missed my bathroom window!
Finn| Yeah, I guess I could take a snack break.
Jake| 'Kay! Well, we'll go back to the tree house, and I'll make us some lunch. I could make the toaster pancakes you like.
Jake| And maybe I can boil up some hot dogs, or—
Finn|  Look.  Now we don't gotta do that thing you wanted to do. 
Jake|  Aah!
Finn| Hot meat!
Jake| Ants again? 
Finn|" ""Ant"" no thang!  Yah!  Caught with your ""ants"" down! ""Ants"" for nothin'!  Forget about ""ant""!  What's wrong? Feeling antsy? "
Jake|  Dude, this is the ant car. We already did the ant car. We did all the ants!
Finn| Same car,  but those were blue ants. These are red ants.
Jake| Finn, I think we should take off. I think this place is bad news for you.
Finn|" Man, no way. All this feels good.  Like my inside voice is saying, ""Hey, keep it up. This is good stuff.""  Aah! Hey!  Ah! Like when you made those biscuits way back? And I kept eating them until they were all gone. Like that!"
Jake| Finn,  I made those biscuits with so much butter. You were just responding to the butter! This whole place is butter!
Finn| Yeah! 
Finn| Boss fight! 
Finn|  
Boss| My jacket-sta! 
Finn|  Check it out battle moon.
Jake| What?   Finn! This is a future crystal! Look!
Jake| That's you, dude! You're old, you're alone, and you're still fighting on this dumb train!
Future Finn|"  Get ""ant"" of town."
Finn| Whoa. I'm gonna have the best life!
Finn| Oh, Hair Apes!
Jake| Nuh-uh, dude. I'm bored, I'm tired, and I'm goin' back to the tree house.  You can come with me if you want.
Finn| What? No, man! It's better on the train; stuff makes sense here.
Hair Ape|  
Finn| Yow!  
Jake| I'm sorry. If you wish to join me, I'll be in the tree house experiencing the joys of life and not getting attacked by gorillas made out of hair.
Finn| You'll be back.
Jake| No, I won't, Finn.  Goodbye!
Finn|" Hey!   ""Hair"" we go!"
Jake|  What're you doin' up here?
Hair Ape|  
Jake|  Are you gettin' sick of things down there, too?
Jake| Mm-hmm.
Jake| You're not gonna try and zap me, are you?
Jake| I wonder what my kids are doin'. 
Jake| Hey!  I knew it!
Jake|  Gotta find that kid. Hey, Finn!  Fi—oh!  Umm... hey, there, friend. I ain't lookin' for no trouble. Just lookin' for my friend, Finn. Maybe you seen him? About five feet tall, picks his nose, and always kinda smells funny l—
Finn| Hey, hey! Jake, it's me!  I'm just all souped up now.
Jake| Ah, jeez, Finn. I... for a minute there, I thought you were one of those twisted-lost-soul boss guys.
Finn|  Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl.
Jake| Wait, you are! You are one!
Finn| What? Those guys are cool!
Jake| That's it, man! I'm gettin' you off this train whether you like it or not! 
Finn| Jake, stay back. I mean it!
Jake| Oh, please. What're you gonna do? I'm ten times stronger than—
Jake| Ah, gross! 
Finn|  Yoink!   Pff, Jake—tryin' to tell me what to do. Pff, yeah, right. I tells me what to do. Now let's see what we got here.  Apple, apple, chicken, apple...  Oh, yeah, that little orb in which I rule! Let's see that again, orb.  Yeah, that's right. Lookin' right.  Wait a second, who's that sad ward little guy followin' me around?  Jake? All those years—he stayed with me.
Future Jake| Finn, can we slow down? My feet hurt.
Future Finn| What?
Finn| Oh, Jake. Hang in there, buddy. I'ma set this right.
Jake| Finn? Finn, I'm sorry. I'll stay on the train with you, I swear. Just get this stuff off of me.
Finn|  No, I'm sorry, Jake. I messed up, but don't worry. It's all over now.
Jake| You mean we're gettin' off the train?
Finn| Well... you are. I'm gonna keep playin' for a while. I'll meet you back home in a week or two.
Jake| Aw, man, don't you see that's just the train talkin'? It's got its hooks in you! 
Finn|  No, no for real!  My inside is tellin' me it's time. Here,  see for yourself.
Jake| Yeah, man. That's what I'm talkin' about. That... is what I'm talkin' about.
Finn| Wha—?
Finn| Wha—?!
Jake| What? Finn?!
Jake| I'm coming! 
Finn| She's got me! She's got me!
Jake|  Yo, bro, you're sleepwalking again! Wake up! 
Finn| Whoa. Jake? Was I...?
Jake|" Yes, Finn. Again. Every time youse is screaming about ""She's got me!"" and all that."
Finn| She's got... Wha?
Jake| Wait, you don't remember? You just woke up, man! Recall it, baby! Come on.
Jake| That's too much; don't punch yourself.
Finn| Eh, it's gone. I don't know.
Jake|   You're repressin' the memory, dude!
Finn| I'm what?
Jake| You're hiding whatever she is in a mental vault.
Finn| Oh, yeah. The vault. That's where the stuff I can't handle goes. Kerplunk.
Jake| Okay, so you even know you're doing it? 
Finn| Yeah. 
Jake| Listen, we gotta find out who this lady is. We gotta open the vault a little.
Finn| No, sir.
Jake| This is just gonna keep happening, man.
Finn| It's alright. I'm not hurting anybody.
Jake| Finn, for reals.
Finn|  NO!
Jake| Alright. Chill, chill. Don't sweat it, man. It's not even a thing.
Finn| Cool.
Jake| Why don't you clean up the kitchen now?
Finn| Okay. I'm sorry I did that.
Jake| It's alright. It's only, like, the fifth room you've train-wrecked this month.
Jake| Wow, that was fast.
Finn| Yup.
Jake| While you were doing that, I downloaded a new game on BMO.
Finn| There's a cricket in here.
Jake|  Huh?
Finn| What is it?
Jake| I don't know. Lady said it's good.
Finn| Hmmm. She likes those games where you're, like, collecting materials to make stationery.
Jake| Naw, this is different.  It's different.
Finn| A'ight, let's peep it.
Finn| Regression Simulator? Uh, okay.
Finn| Start.
Male Voice| Welcome, adventurer.
Finn| Whoa.
Male Voice| I am the Hypno-Priest. I will be your guide.
Male Voice|  Deep into your subconscious mind. Follow me now, adventurer.
Finn|   The vault.
Jake| Go in there, man! Don't be scurred.
Jake| What do you see?
Finn| I see... my past lives.
Finn| I was a comet...
Finn|  A butterfly...
Finn|  A thing... I don't know what that is. Some kind of shape? Or a doodoo in another dimension?
Jake| Do you remember anything about the scary lady?
Finn| Scary lady?
Finn| Yeah. I was her! Except she was a chubby tiger.
Finn| No, no, no, wait, wait, wait. She was riding a tiger, and she wasn't scary.
Boss| Hey, girl.
Boss| Sniffin' around for that chedda?
Shoko| You know it. Got any work for me?
Boss| I might could, but it's a top-shelf shakedown. Know what I'm saying?
Shoko| I can step to that.
Boss| There's a rival camp down river. The leader's got some magic omelette, you know?  Mmm. You know? The kind you wear around your neck.
Shoko|" I think it's pronounced ""amulet."""
Boss| Oh, don't get fresh with me, girlie. I talk good. Anyway, when I get my hands on that omelet, whoo-hoo! Forget about everything, baby. I'll be the biggest cheese in creation.
Shoko| Sounds cool. I'll take the job
Boss| Shake on it.
Boss| You pull this off, and I'll let you join my gang.
Shoko| Uh... that's okay. I'll just work for coin.
Boss| And, on the other hand, so to speak, if you screw up or chicken out, you're out of the game. Permanently.  Pretend my finger's a knife.
Shoko| Play dead.
Shoko|  Deader.
Banana Guard| Ah! Another attack!
Banana Guard| My leader! Another attack!
Princess Bubblegum| Bring them inside.
Princess Bubblegum| Hey, you're up!
Princess Bubblegum| I thought you might be hungry.
Princess Bubblegum| So, who knocked you out?
Shoko| Bath Boy Gang.
Princess Bubblegum| Ugh! I hate those boys!
Shoko| Yeah, they stole everything I had, but that's okay. My parents always told me that simple possessions aren't the most important things in life.
Princess Bubblegum| Word 'em up.
Shoko|"  They told me ""all you really need is a good computer."""
Princess Bubblegum| Amen. Wait, what?!
Shoko| They traded my arm to some tranch for a computer.
Princess Bubblegum| They what?!
Shoko|  What?
Princess Bubblegum| Parents should protect their children!
Shoko| What? Really?
Shoko| Do you have any kids?
Princess Bubblegum| All the Candy People are like my children, except young Mr. Cream Puff... he's like my boyfriend. Anyway, protecting my people is the most important thing to me. That's why I've got to take down the Bath Boy Gang.
Shoko| You think you can do that?
Princess Bubblegum| I got a plan—a secret, awesome plan. In the meantime, I've gotta cover this radioactive river with candy. Wanna help?
Princess Bubblegum| Thanks for pitching in, Shoko! You can stay here as long as you want.
Bath Boy| Psst! Psst! Shoko!
Shoko| What are you doing here?!
Bath Boy| I'm spyin' on you. Wait 'til I tell boss that you quit the life for a cruddy day job!
Shoko| I'm gaining her trust, you momo. Say... you can help me.
Bath Boy| Huh?
Shoko| Stay away from me you gang boy! Ahhhhh!
Princess Bubblegum|  A Bath Boy!
Bath Boy| What're you doing?!
Shoko| Be cool!
Princess Bubblegum| That was bananamas! Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Shoko| My parents took me to a dojo when I was little... they never came back.
Princess Bubblegum| Wow. Your parents are the worst... hey, come with me. I wanna show you something.
Princess Bubblegum| My secret project is in here.
Shoko| Whoa... what are they?
Princess Bubblegum| The Gumball Guardians. Wanna help me finish them?
Shoko| Yeah!
Princess Bubblegum| That's it! There's just one last step.
Princess Bubblegum| Hello.
Gumball Guardians|  Hello, mother!
Princess Bubblegum| Y'all go guard now, and don't let nobody mess with my stuff!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey, guess what, thanks for helping me make those guys.
Shoko| I like feeling handy.
Princess Bubblegum| I want to repay you for your help.
Shoko| Oh, yeah? You gonna give me that amulet, maybe?
Princess Bubblegum|  No. No, dude, I made you a thing.
Princess Bubblegun| That's it. You can do it.
Shoko| You made me a man servant?
Princess Bubblegum|  No! In the box.
Shoko| Oh, no...
Princess Bubblegum|" What do you mean ""Oh, no""? I made you an arm! It's a dang plug 'n' play, girl."
Shoko| No, it's awesome... I can't believe it.
Princess Bubblegum| That's right, I'm a technical wonder-child.
Shoko| Yeah, I know.  I'm sorry, I gotta go to my room for no reason.
Princess Bubblegum| Okay! I thought we could do some two-arm stuff, but... uh, it's cool!
Bath Boy Gang Leader| Pretend my finger's a knife.
Shoko|  I'm sorry, Princess Bubblegum...
Gumball Guardian| Are you okay, princess?
Princess Bubblegum| Ah, jeez, you're so loud!
Gumball Guardian| Are you in danger?
Princess Bubblegum| No! Don't just guard me! You need to protect everyone!
Gumball Guardian| Okay.
Gumball Guardian| I knew it. Princess, you are getting jacked.
Princess Bubblegum| Wha-hut? Whoa, hey!
Gumball Guardian| Halt!
Shoko| Ahhhhhhhh!
Princess Bubblegum| Get her out of there, quick!
Gumball Guardians| Yes, mom.
Gumball Guardian| Uhhh...
Princess Bubblegum| Alright. Take a break for the night.
Jake| How you doin', buddy?
Finn| The past was to be reckoned with.
Jake| That's cool. Whachu' gonna do about it?
Princess Bubblegum|  Hallo, Bubblegum hier...  atonement? Alright, Finn, I'm on my way.
Shoko| Ahhh... look at that. I got a new arm. That would be cool if I weren't about hit my reset button...
Finn| Hey, hey. This way.
Jake| What was th—aww, no.  Dog-drangit, Finn...
Finn| Okay, here you go.
Princess Bubblegum| Whoa, what?! My amulet?! Wait a second...  Is that...?
Finn| It's me, Shoko! And PB, you're like a bazillion years old. You're not freaking nineteen! What the heck?!
Finn| Weirdo.
Finn| Heh. My vault feels lighter.
Jake| Yeah, you think you're pretty way up there but I can get you! 
Lady Rainicorn| 나 잡아봐봐~ 
Princess Bubblegum| Alright. Let me just add three more drops of explosive diarrhea.
Finn and Princess Bubblegum| Oooo...
Finn| Hey Princess Bubblegum, when we bring the dead back to life, will it be filled with worms?
Princess Bubblegum| No. If my decorpsinator serum works, all the dead Candy People will look as young and healthy as you do.
Princess Bubblegum| Pick up that platter, tough guy.
Finn| Old Mr. Cream Puff?
Princess Bubblegum|  We used to date. 
Finn| Something's happening! Come on, come on...
Princess Bubblegum| Work.
Finn| Algebraic!
Princess Bubblegum| Wait, something's wrong.
Zombie Mr. Cream Puff| Sugar! 
Finn and Princess Bubblegum| Ew!
Finn| Hey, look, the decorpsinator serum is working!
Princess Bubblegum| No, this is wrong. They're not coming back to life--they're still dead! The decorpsinator serum--it's incomplete! 
Zombie Love Heart|  Rah. Must eat sugar!
Finn|  You're grounded, Mister.
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, this is really bad. They're going to be attracted to the Candy Kingdom!
Finn| Why?
Princess Bubblegum| Because the Candy People are made of sugar, ya ding dong!
Zombie Mr. Cream Puff|  Gimme some sugar, baby.
Finn| Chew on this! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Good one, Finn. Quickly, to the kingdom!
Finn|  Get a life!
Princess Bubblegum| All citizens of the Candy Kingdom! Report to the palace, immediately!
Jake| Whoa!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hurry, sweet citizens.
Finn| Alright, you heard the princess, everyone in! Alright, no pushing, come on!
Jake| Dude, what's up?
Finn| The princess will explain everything. Tree Trunks, get those hot buns in here, girl.
Tree Trunks|  Oh, I hope it's not bad news.
Finn| Did we get everyone?
Manfried| All present and accounted for.
Finn| Thanks, Manfried.
Manfried| You're welcome.
Princess Bubblegum| Citizens, we are assembled here in the candy foyer for a momentous announcement. Tonight we are all going to have... a slumber party!
Finn| What?!
Finn| Wait! What about the zom--?! 
Princess Bubblegum| Go ahead and start partying.
Finn|  But, Princess, the Undead--
Princess Bubblegum|  We'll be right back, everyone.
Jake| Whooo!
Princess Bubblegum| Finn, the Candy People can't know about the zombies.
Finn| Wha?!
Princess Bubblegum| If they knew, they would flip out.
Finn|" What do you mean ""flip out""?"
Princess Bubblegum| I mean they would flip out.
Starchie| Princess? It's me, Starchie the gravedigger. I brought you a larger corpse shovel. Oh, Princess? Well, I'll just wait for you here, then. By the mausoleum. With my back turned. And my defenses lowered.
Finn| Candy People explode when they get scared?!
Princess Bubblegum| Not telling the Candy People about the zombies is so important that you need to promise, Royal Promise, not to let anyone find out about the zombies, ever.
Finn| Okay, sure.
Princess Bubblegum| No, Finn. You have to Royal Promise.
Finn| Yes,  I Royal Promise.
Princess Bubblegum| Now I must cloister myself in the lab and finish the equation to my decorpsinator serum. You keep the candy folk distracted and ignorant. Can you do that?
Finn| Yes, your highness.
Princess Bubblegum| Good. Don't tell anyone about the zombies. Never ever. 
Finn| No, wait. Can I at least tell  Jake?
Jake| Tell me about what, dude?
Finn| You know, about the outbreak of zom-- 
Jake|  Alright, what's going on?
Finn| Uhh, nothing at all, buddy! 
Jake| Hey, dude. I think you and Bubblegum are up to something.
Finn|  Ahha ah, what? No, no way.
Jake| Whoa, you guys are up to something. Is it some sort of prank? Can I get in on it?
Finn|"  Who wants to play ""Truth or Dare""?"
Jake| Hmm...
Finn| Ok, Chocoberry, you may ask someone to tell a deep truth or a saucy dare.
Chocoberry| Mr. Cupcake, truth or dare?
Mr. Cupcake| Dare.
Chocoberry| I dare you to take off your wrapper.
Jake|  Hey seriously, man. I'm your bro. Bros are supposed to tell bros everything all the time. What are you and Bubblegum up to? Is everything alright?
Finn| Yep! Fine! Everything is great! Heh, heh.  Except for that. Whoa.
Peppermint Butler| I didn't know he was chocolate.
Mr. Cupcake| Jake, truth or dare?
Jake| Truth.
Mr. Cupcake| Do you prefer chocolate or fudge?
Jake| I can't eat chocolate or fudge 'cause I'm a dog and they'd probably kill me, but hmmmmm probably... neither. Finn! Truth or dare?
Finn| Dare! Haha!
Jake| I dare you... to tell me the truth about what's going on in your mind. What were you and Bubblegum talking about when you were alone together?
Finn|  Umm, ahh, the truth is, ahhh...
Hallucination of Princess Bubblegum| You promised you wouldn't freakin' tell anyone! Oh, you're so cute, Finn.
Finn| Ahhh... the truth is... that I'd rather play Dodge Socks!
Jake| I'm not playing dodge socks 'til you stop dodging my questions. Hey...  Old Mr. Cream Puff? Isn't he dead?
Finn| Hey, give me my sock back! Dodge Socks was a bad idea!
Jake| Whoa.  Look dude, just tell me what's up, 'cause you are crazier than a cannonball tonight.
Finn|  Oh, my goodness! Princess hasn't finished the equation and the zombies are here!
Finn| I, uh, she just want this slumber party to be super fun, and if I did have something to tell you, then I would in a second, and it would make my life easier, unless there was something stopping me, like a promise, but there isn't, so I won't, so it's cool.
Zombie| Sugar!
Jake| What? You lost me.
Finn| Umm... Hey, you know what time it is?
Jake| Adventure time?
Finn| No, time for Seven Minutes in Heaven! You're first.
Jake| Really?
Finn| Lady Rainicorn! In the closet with Jake!
Lady| 뭐? 나? 웃겨 정말. 그래, 좋아. 하자. 
Jake| Okay, okay, alright.  But in seven minutes, I'm gonna come out and make you spill your beans, Finn.
Finn| I can't hear you all the way in heaven!
Chet| Umm, does anyone else hear that?
Finn| What? Hear what? I, I don't hear anything.
Chet| I hear something I don't understand... and it makes me scared! 
Finn| What? No, Chet. Everybody, wait. What noise? You mean this noise? 
Chet| Oh. 
Finn| Yeah! Dance it! Bust it up! Uh! Uh! Uh! Oh!
Chocoberry| What is this game you are playing at now, Finn?
Finn| Uhh, it's... Blockado. Haha, the game of barricades. Come on, let's block all the entrances and windows!
Finn| Alright, this is not a permanent solution. Think Finn, how can you keep everyone from finding out?
Manfried| Find out about what, Finn?
Finn| Manfried, the talking piñata! Your convenient appearance gives me a great idea. Everyone, grab a stick! New game! We're gonna smash some piñatas!
Manfried| What?
Finn| Except for you, Manfried.
Manfried| Oh, thank goodness.
Finn| Now everybody don these blindfolds.  Thanks, Taffy Girl.
Finn| Alright, everybody, get together. I'm hanging the piñatas...  They're all around you. Smash the piñatas!
Finn| Yeah! You guys are on fire!
Chocoberry| Oh, it is so tasty.
Finn| Yes! We did it! My improbable plan worked!
Jake| Whew!
Lady| 안녕! 
Jake| Seven minutes up yet?  Whoa!  What the nuts happened here?!
Finn| Oh, we killed all the zombies that Princess Bubblegum and I raised from the dead.
Jake| Really!?
Finn| Jake? What's going on?
Princess Bubblegum| What? Huh? Oh, Finn! Did you break your Royal Promise?
Finn| Yeah, but, I mean, all the zombies are dead. The Candy People won't freak out. What's the big deal?
Princess Bubblegum| This is really, really bad, Finn. You can't break Royal Promises. Never, ever, never. No matter what, forever.
Princess Bubblegum| The Guardians of the Royal Promise are coming for us.
Finn and Princess Bubblegum| Whoa!
Guardian 1| Finn the Human. You have broken a Royal Promise for which the penalty is trial by fire.
Finn| That's stupid.
Princess Bubblegum| Wait! He's my friend! Isn't there another option?!
Guardian 1| Yes. Because you care for the promise-breaker, we will give him a less hot trial. You must now answer...
Guardian 2| ...Math questions!
Finn| Mathematical!
Princess Bubblegum| Finn, you're terrible at math.
Finn| Awww.
Guardian 1| Now, solve this! 
Finn| Uhh....
Guardian 2| Oh, wait, wait, I thought of a better one. 
Guardian 1| Yes! Two plus two. Solve it or die.
Finn| Uhh. Four, right?
Guardian 1| Oh, correct.
Finn| What's happening, Princess?
Princess Bubblegum| You've defeated the broken royal promise! The Gumball Guardians are resetting!
Finn|" Slamacow! That was tops! Who's not good at math? I was all ""Four!"""
Princess Bubblegum| Four, four... Four, four, four... That's it! The answer was so simple, I was too smart to see it!
Finn| You're welcome!
Princess Bubblegum| '4' is the last figure I need to perfect my decorpsinator serum.
Revived Zombie| Golly!
Finn| Woohoo! Yeah!
Jake| This is messed up, but sweet.
Lady Rainicorn| 진짜로. 
Candy Person 1| Uncle Chewy!
Candy Person 2| Grandma!
Ice Cream Lady| Former dead relative!
Jake| Starchie!
Starchie| Mornin'.
Jake|  Man, you broke a Royal Promise? You're nuts. All you had to do is say that it was a royal secret. I know what's up. 
Princess Bubblegum| I hope you grasp the full consequences of breaking promises.
Finn| Heck yeah! If I break a Royal Promise, I get to fight zombies, throw slumber parties, awake Gumball Guardians and... and...
Princess Bubblegum| Alright, alright.
Finn|  And reverse death itself!
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, you are adorable. But keep your promises, okay?
Finn| I will, Princess.
Finn| Starchie, you're not a zombie.
Starchie| I can't help it. Flesh is delicious!
Finn| You're delicious!
Starchie|  Don't squeeze me! I'll fart!
Finn and Jake|  Swords! Yeah, swords! Whoo!
Tree Trunks|  Oh, men and their swords... You boys, stop horsing around with my apples!
Both Finn and Jake| Aw,Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks|  Now, come on over! I baked y'all an apple pie.
Finn|  Yeah, apple pie!
Jake|  Whooo-hoo-hoo!
Finn|  I'm gonna eat it all before you even GET there! 
Jake|  Noooooo!
Finn|  Apple pie!
Jake|   Don't let him eat it all!
Tree Trunks|   Now, you boys sit down and behave yourselves. Oh!
Tree Trunks|  Shoo, fly! Get off my apple pie! Huh!  A fly landed on my pie. That's no good.  Bye-bye.
Finn|  Why are you throwing the pie away?
Tree Trunks|  Flies wanted it, they can have it.
Tree Trunks|  Anyways, don't y'all worry 'cause the new pie is coming in the wag of a lamb's tail.
Finn and Jake|  New pie?
Finn|  Woohoo! Pie, yeah!
Jake|  Yeah! Wowowowowo
Tree Trunks|  Here you are.
Finn|  Wow.
Tree Trunks|  Come on, go ahead.
Tree Trunks|  What you think?
Jake|  Best apple pie ever!
Tree Trunks|  Oh, Jake, thank you, but that ain't the best apple pie.
Finn|  What are you talking about, Tree Trunks? What can be better than your apple pie?
Jake|  You ate all the pie...
Tree Trunks|  Finn, what would you do if you could do anything?
Finn|  Anything? Well, I'd catch a shooting star, travel to outer space and fight space monsters!
Jake|  I'd carve my face on the moon so the moon would look like my face!
Finn|  What would you do, Tree Trunks?
Tree Trunks|  I would go pick an apple.
Finn|  ...Lame.
Finn|  I'm sorry. I mean, it's just you pick apples every day.
Tree Trunks|  This apple ain't like the apples that I pick. They say it's the apple of apples; rarest kind of all. Legends call it the Crystal Gem Apple.
Jake|  That sounds awesome!
Finn|  Where is it?
Tree Trunks|  I've heard that it grows at the deepest end of the Evil Dark Forest.
Finn|  Whoo! Tree Trunks you gotta go pick that apple!
Jake|  YEAH!
Tree Trunks|  What? Me? Oh, no I'm just a cute little elephant. I'm not cut out for adventuring.
Finn|  Tree Trunks! This is your dream! Think about eating that apple with your own mouth.
Jake|  Or your trunk.
Finn|  Imagine the flavor.
Jake|  And your satisfied face.
Tree Trunks|  Really? You think I can handle the Scary Dark Forest?
Finn|  Yeah, and we'll help you.
Jake|  We love you, Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks|  Okay. I'll do it. Call me... Adventurer Tree Trunks.
Finn & Jake|  Yeah, Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks|  I love being so high up from the ground!
Jake|  Psst, I can take you even higher on my shoulders.
Finn|  No, Jake. She has a weak heart.
Jake|  Oh, yeah.
Finn|  Ewww, why is this ground all squishy?
Jake|  Whatever it is, I'm liking it. Oh, yeah!
Tree Trunks|  I wanna try!
Finn|  Okay. I'm cool with you letting you do whatever you want.
Tree Trunks|  Heeheehee! It's like some cookie dough!
Tree Trunks|  Oh, hello there.
Finn|  Uhh, Tree Trunks, stay away from that.
Finn|  Ugh, you're gonna get it, wall of flesh.
Tree Trunks|  An eye and a mouth. Well, I think I got the perfect thing for him or her... stickers!
Finn|  Careful, Tree Trunks, this thing is evil.
Tree Trunks|  Here's a rainbow sticker, and here's a scratch-and-sniff sticker. Smells just like a pickle. Oh, and this one is a holographic unicorn, but it doesn't have a horn.
Tree Trunks|  Oh, now, whatcha doing?
Finn|  Huh? Tree Trunks!
Jake|  Whoo!
Finn|  You better stay in that tree, baby. Um, Tree Trunks were you putting stickers on that evil monster?
Tree Trunks|  Yes, I thought it needed some tender love and affection. Oh, what a pretty butterfly!
Finn|  Tree Trunks? Ugh. Jake, I just realized that Tree Trunks is old and bonkers. We can't take her through this Evil Dark Forest.
Jake|  Nah, she'll be fine.
Finn|  But the monsters?
Jake|  It's fine. It's fine!
Finn|  Are you sure? 'Cause she has zero adventurer training.
Jake|  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's fine, she'll be fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
Finn|   Maybe it is fine. Tree Trunks?
Jake|  Where'd she go?
Finn|  Tree Trunks!
Finn|  We gotta find her, Jake! Tree Trunks!
Jake|  Where are you, Tree Trunks?
Tree Trunks|  And here's your teacup, and here's my teacup.
Finn & Jake|  Tree Trunks! 
Tree Trunks|  And here's your sandwich. Oops, you dropped it.
Finn|  Tree Trunks, run!
Tree Trunks|  Oh, hey, Finn.
Jake|  Hiya!
Finn|  Time to call your mamas, evil sign posts.
Tree Trunks|  Patience, boys. There's enough tea for everyone.
Finn|  Errr...
Finn|  NO!
Tree Trunks|  Oh, Finn. What a nice hug.
Finn|  I'm not hugging you! I'm trying to save your life! There's too many!!
Jake|  Finn?!
Tree Trunks|  Oh, Finn. That tea party was crummier than a big old biscuit.
Finn|  Errrr. Tree Trunks, I'm all jacked up because of you. Look at my jacked up face!
Tree Trunks|  Are you mad at me?
Finn|  No, I'm not mad. You're too super-cute for me to be mad at you, and you're a top notch adventurer. Now, let's go find and eat the heck out of that crystal gem apple together.
Finn|  Dang it!
Jake|  You go fight—I'll keep Tree Trunks out of trouble.
Finn|  Awesome.
Tree Trunks|  J-Jake I think Finn is getting jacked up again.
Jake|  Yeah, Finn can handle it. He's 12.
Tree Trunks|  I think I know a way to help him out.
Jake|  Uhh, you should stay here, Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks|  But I thought Finn told me that I was a top notch adventurer. And my adventurer instincts tell me to seduce that tentacle critter with my womanly charms and elephant prowess.
Jake|  Uhh, no way.
Finn|  Uh, what are you doing here, Tree Trunks?
Tree Trunks|  I'm helping you by tempting this guy with my body.
Finn|  It's not a guy, Tree Trunks! It's a Snake Armed Ruby Brain Beast!
Tree Trunks|  Even brain beasts get lonely, Finn!
Finn|  Jake! You were supposed to watch her!
Jake|  She got passed me, man. I tried to stop her, but she overpowered me.
Finn|  GET her out of here!
Jake|  Huh?
Jake|  Finn, kill it!
Finn|  I can't find it's magic gem weak spot!
Finn|  Oh, there it is.
Tree Trunks|  I did it! I helped! I'm the sexiest adventurer in the world!
Finn|  Tree Trunks!! You're not an adventurer! You nearly got yourself killed again! Do you wanna die, Tree Trunks?! Is that what you think adventurers do?! Die and make all their friends feel terrible 'cause they couldn't save them?!
Jake|  Whoa, man.
Tree Trunks|  I'm going home now.
Finn|  Ugh... Tree Trunks. Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks|  Don't follow me. Oh, Finn... You shouldn't yell at cuties that just wanna help you. OH!
Finn|  Man, I feel horrible. I was only yelling because I care about her safety.
Jake|  That's what happens when you care too much, dude.
Tree Trunks|  OH!
Finn and Jake|  Tree Trunks! Huh!
Tree Trunks|  Finn, I found the crystal gem apple.
Finn|  Woohoo!
Jake|  You're the man, Tree Trunks!
Finn|  Tree Trunks, I'm a huge butt guy for getting mad at you. I'm a huge fart. I was only upset because... I love you and I don't wanna see you get hurt.
Tree Trunks|  That's precious, Finn, and I'll accept your apology if you let me kiss your cheek.
Finn|  Uhhhh, I don't know, I--
Jake|  Whoa! Let her kiss your cheek, man. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Crystal Guardian Jake|  Whoa! Let her kiss your cheek, man. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
Crystal Guardian Finn|  Uhhhh, I don't know...
Finn|  A crystal guardian! Tree Trunks, stay out of the monster battle this time. I don't want you getting hurt.
Tree Trunks|  Alright, I promise I will.
Finn|  Radical! Back off you!
Crystal Guardian Finn|  Back off you!
Finn|  Stop copying me! Grrah!
Crystal Guardian Finn|  Stop copying me! Grrah!
Finn|  Ahhhh! A-a-oww..
Jake|  Finn! Graw!
Crystal Guardian Jake|  Graw!
Jake|  Ow! Ow.
Finn|  He's copying everything we do.
Tree Trunks|  Hey! It's my butterfly-friend. That's precious.
Jake|  Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks!
Crystal Guardian Jake|  Whoo! Shake it, Tree Trunks!
Finn|  Gem-clam! Let's beat it up while it's copying Tree Trunks! Yaah!
Jake|  Crud, this is barf dude.
Finn|  Oh, man, I'm a total moron! We gotta fight this one Tree Trunks style.
Jake|  I'll get the make up.
Finn|  Hey! Crystal Guardian, are you okay with Tree Trunks taking a bite of that apple?
Jake|  I'm okay with it.
Crystal Guardian Jake|  I'm okay with it.
Jake|  And I'm stupid.
Crystal Guardian Jake|  And I'm stupid.
Jake|  Heh-heh, you heard the guardian, TT. Bite that thing.
Tree Trunks|  Okay!
Finn|  Whoo! How's it taste, Tree Trunks?
Jake|  Yeah! How is it?
Ice King|" Get back here, worm! What?! The last chapter of ""Cosmic Kissing""? My stirring lyrical interlude from ""Fionna Goes to the Market""? The epilogue from ""Flame Prince Breaks a Sweat""?!  Who gave you permission to edit my fan fiction?! Prepare to be punished! But first... what'd ya think?"
Gunther| Wenk!
Ice King| Great critique! 
Gunther| Wenk.
Ice King| I don't need an editor. I'm my own editor -- editor-in-king!
Ice King|" Ooh! My custom tape! Remix!  ""Sunlight gleamed through the window as Fionna sat patiently at the breakfast table."" "
Cake| Hah! Check out my sweet flippin' moves.
Fionna| You're a real ace in the kitchen.
Cake| Roar! Ha ha! Cooking is fun! Here come the flapjacks!
Fionna| Know what's better than cooking?
Cake| No!
Fionna| Wha?!
Cake| These are narrative flapjacks. Darlin', don't you see the brilliant comedy laid out before you? You wouldn't eat Act II before Act I, silly. Now try starting with the dockworker having a moral crisis.
Fionna| Okay. This...one?
Cake| Fionna, this character doesn't serve any thematic purpose until much later in the meal.
Fionna| Sorry, Cake, but these just look like formless blobs of sweet flapjack to me.
Cake|" Mmm... It's true. Maybe if I based them off real people, do some ""life cooking"" -- nonfiction flapjacks! Let's go griddle up portraits of the entire kingdom! Got to get my supplies together. My portable griddle... Mmm. Some peppermint eggs... and the twice-cursed flour! Got it! Ready for stories and flapjacks?"
Fionna| Heck yes!
Flour Demon| You're wasting me on breakfast!
Fionna and Cake|  No one asked you, Flour Demon.
Ice King|" That was like a cookbook... written by a genius. On to the next chapter -- ""A Game of Gumball."""
Fionna| Prince Gumball would probs make a great flapjack model. Sometimes he gets so absorbed in his work that he doesn't move for days.
Cake| Ooooh! I can break out the pink sea salt and --
Fionna| Hey, there's Gumball!
Prince Gumball|  Is it here? No. No. Ah! Just what I need! The periodic table of candy elements! If I use this one and this one here... Ha ha! The perfect strategy! Hyup!  Butterscotch Butler, the butterscotch Scottish butler, I challenge you!
Butterscotch Butler|  Again?
Prince Gumball| I've gathered all the necessary strategy and tactics to finally defeat you!
Butterscotch Butler| To play, one must know strategy, yes. But to know victory, one must also know their opponent!
Prince Gumball| Opponent?
Butterscotch Butler| Their dreams... ...their ambitions.... ...their rrrregrets... ...and their fears!
Prince Gumball| M-My mortality!
Butterscotch Butler| King me.
Fionna| Maybe we should find someone a little more relaxed.
Prince Gumball| How?! How did you know?!
Butterscotch Butler| Huh? Oh. You leave that lying around everywhere.
Cake| Yes! Still not quite right.
Fionna| How about this for some inspiration?
Cake| Pancakes and flapjacks are nothing alike!
Fionna| Aw, Cake.
Cake| It's just that flapjack literature is such a niche genre, and none of my flapjacks are turning out any good.
Fionna| Come on, Cake. We've still got 10 minutes before the library closes. It's Flame Prince!
Cake| What's that fire hazard doing in the library?
Turtle Prince| Hmm? Oh, no! Oh! I love that author! Have you read her newest book? I-I could, uh, find it for you.
Flame Prince| Oh. Uh, n-nah, that's okay. I'll just start with this one. Thanks, though.
Turtle Prince| Uh -- Aah!
Flame Prince| Oh. Sorry about that. Uh -- Uh -- W-w-w-- W-w-w-- Eh... No, no, no, no, no! Hot, hot, hot!
Flame Prince| Wow. I am not graceful today.
Turtle Prince| N-Not the first editions! Ow, ow! Ow, ow, ow! Easy... Unh! Gah! Huh?! Leaving, yes?
Flame Prince| Yeah. I'll borrow this one, please.
Turtle Prince| Of course! I'll just need you to sign it out.
Turtle Prince| I'm sorry. I have a duty to serve the library's patrons, but I'm also sworn to protect the books. I can't in good conscience let you take it home. But maybe I could read this book to you?
Flame Prince| Listen, I just came in here to use the bathroom, man. I thought you had to, like, check out a book first to pee. Actually, I don't even have a library card.
Marshall Lee| Lumpy Space Prince! Lumpy Spaaaace Priiiince! Come on. You've been coughing for five days. Just take one tablespoon.
Lumpy Space Prince| Uh... B-Bumpy Space Prince? Uh, there's no one here by that name.
Marshall Lee| Then who am I talking to?
Lumpy Space Prince| Uh, this is Ja-- Jack. 
Marshall Lee| Huh. Well, if you're Jack, then I'mmmm... MMMMichael Dean. Yeah. And I'm looking for this beautiful prince. I got to give him this...magic potion! See, he was cursed by this evil snot gnoll.
Lumpy Space Prince| Really?
Marshall Lee| The snot gnoll transformed him into a totally disgusting mucus monster.
Lumpy Space Prince| What?! No, I'm not!
Marshall Lee| Did you hear that?
Lumpy Space Prince| Huh? What is it?!           
Marshall Lee| It's -- It's --  It's the snot gnoll! Aah! Uh-oh! It's coming towards your tree, Jack!
Lumpy Space Prince| I'm stuck!
Marshall Lee| I'll protect you, beautiful prince! Step off, snot gnoll!
Lumpy Space Prince| Get him, Michael Dean!
Marshall Lee| Gah! It got me! Ugh!
Lumpy Space Prince| No!!
Marshall Lee| I got one last hit in! I-It's running away!  I think this is the end for me.
Lumpy Space Prince| Rally, Michael Dean!
Marshall Lee|  It's...too late for me, beautiful prince. Take the potion.  Take it and live. Live!
Lumpy Space Prince| I won't let your sacrifice be wasted. 
Marshall Lee| See? No more coughing.
Lumpy Space Prince| Hey, yeah. Actually, I do feel better. 
Marshall Lee| Wow. Maybe that was the wrong potion.
Lumpy Space Prince| Much better!
Ice Queen| Lounged atop their comfortable sense of ennui, Flynn the human being and Jacques the raccoon listened to the Ice President read his fiction.
Ice President|" ""Lynn the person looked at Janet and asked, 'Am I my feelings? Do I exist because I can't stop feeling?' Janet the fox answered her. 'Feelings are action, and like all mortal action, they are doomed to failure.'"""
Ice Queen| Flynn and Jacques sighed. They totally got it. The end! What do you guys think? Too philosophical?
Ice Queen|  Out of my way!
Cake| Blazin' blueberries -- comin' through!
Ice Queen| You're ruining my literary reading!
Fionna| Oh, hey, Ice Queen. Do you want Cake to make your flapjack portrait?
Ice Queen| Why, ye-- No! I mean no! Why don't we table this for now, so I can... destroy you!
Cake| Hang on to your turkeys, because I'm about to make the toughest flapjack ever. Some purple chicken milk... dramatic cornmeal... And the tears of this reflective turtle.  You will outlive everyone you love. Cry for me, little mama! Here, Fionna!
Fionna| Tasty! Hey, Ice Queen, I really liked your story. The imagery was tight.
Ice Queen| Can you bElieve it was my first draft?!
Fionna| No way!
Cake|" Gotcha! I call it ""Portrait of an Author."""
Fionna| I really did like her story, though. I wonder how that Ice President got elected.
Ice King| Talk about life imitating art. Gunter, did you see what Daddy did? Did you guess the secret theme?
Gunther| Wenk!
Ice King| No! You're way off! Fionna and Cake were at the breakfast table. Gumball consulted the periodic table. Flame Prince set fire to the table of contents. The...purple thing had a tablespoon of syrup. And Ice Queen...did a tabley thing, too, probably.
Gunther| Wenk!
Ice King| They're not like regular stories. They're shorter. I'll call them...grabl-- No -- tables!
Gunther| Wenk.
Cuber| I'll never look at tables the same way again.
Lumpy Space Messenger| Sir! My sir! A message from their majesties. 
Finn & Jake| King and Queen Lumpy Space!
Lumpy Space Queen|  We can't find our baby girl!
Lumpy Space King|  She's been missing for days!
Finn| Whoa, stop your crying, you two. We'll help you find your daughter. We'll find her using Jake's muscles.  Dude, show off your muscles!
Finn| Whoo!
Lumpy Space King|  No more tears, Boobly-Bear.  Please, take her these sandwiches we made. She loves these sandwiches. Thank you, boys.
Finn| Whoo!
Finn| Dude, I know where Lumpy Space Princess is. She's in the woods eating beans.
Jake| Mmhmm! This is gonna be easy as... uh... mm...
Finn| Easy as childbirth!
Jake| Yeah, okay.
Fat Villager| Please, please help me. A monster is terrorizing our village and has eaten up all the crops.
Finn| Why were you up here in this tree?
Fat Villager| I thought I saw some food, and I was hiding from the monster.  You must help. 
Finn| Hmm. I guess we can help this guy real quick and then get back to LSP.
Jake| Where's your village?
Fat Villager| Umm, I don't remember.
Fat Villager| Howard remembers. Hey! It's Howard! Howard! You remember where the village is?
Howard| Yeah, I marked it on the map, but  it's only half.
Howard| Well, we're all ready.
Fat Villager #2| We can't leave yet.
Fat Villagers| Aw.
Howard| Alright, now we're ready.
Fat Villager #3| What's in the basket?
Jake| Sammiches!
Fat Villagers| Food! Food! 
Finn| Wait! You can't eat this food! It's not ours to give!
Fat Villagers| Aw.
Finn| Now, show us the way to your town.
Fat Villager #4| Too tired from hunger. Carry me?
Finn|  Okay. 
Fat Villager #1| The monster lives in that windmill, but we're too scared to go near it.
Finn & Jake|  Nothing scares us!
Jake| Be alert. Anything could pop out of there and rip our faces off. 
Finn| Whoo. 
Jake| Be careful, Finn.
Finn & Lumpy Space Princess|  
Finn| It's you!
Lumpy Space Princess| Finn, what the junk?
Jake| It's you!
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, sandwiches! 
Jake| LSP, what the heck are you doin' here?
Finn| Are you in here making out with the monster?
Lumpy Space Princess|  No... I am the monster.
Jake| Whaaaaat?
Lumpy Space Princess| It's a long story.
Lumpy Space Princess| It all started at my lumpin' parents' house.
Lumpy Space King| Daughter?
Lumpy Space Princess| Yeah?
Lumpy Space Queen| How are the sandwiches?
Lumpy Space Princess| They're lumpin' delicious, Mom.
Lumpy Space King| You know, you could enjoy your mom's sandwiches every day if you came back more often.
Lumpy Space Princess| No. You can have them delivered to me at my apartment.
Lumpy Space Queen| We want you to move back home, sweetheart.
Lumpy Space Princess| What?!  You invited me here under false pretenses?! 
Lumpy Space King| Wait, sweetheart. We're just worried about you.
Lumpy Space Princess| Ha! Y'all don't think I can make it on my own? I'll show you! I'm running away!
Lumpy Space Princess| I stormed out and left Lumpy Space forever.
Jake| Oh, and then you found this windmill.
Lumpy Space Princess|  No. Something else happened first. Keep listening.
Lumpy Space Princess| I was so cold, and I was so very hungry.
Lumpy Space Princess| Uh! Oh, Glob! Maybe I can... make a shelter out of these nuts!
Lumpy Space Princess| It's not fair.
Lumpy Space Princess|" I was rescued by a family of wolves. The mama wolf was all like, ""We must take care of her, as if she were our own."" And Papa Wolf was all like, ""This is a special child who needs special love because she's gonna be great when she grows up."""
Finn| So these were talking wolves?
Lumpy Space Princess| No, they were normal wolves. I knew what they were thinking because of their body language. Stop interrupting, Finn.
Lumpy Space Princess| I found a home where I could act like myself.
Lumpy Space Princess| They took care of me.
Lumpy Space Princess| I knew that if my parents could see me now, they'd be jealous of how lumpin' awesome I am.
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, my Glob!
Lumpy Space Princess| But then, the drama started.
Lumpy Space Princess|   Stephanie, Sue, can you guys keep a secret?  Okay, here's the secret I just saw Jessica making out with Mark... behind Tony's back! Stephanie, are you even listening? 'Cause I'm kinda freaking out right now! Tony's gonna come back from hunting any minute now, and—
Lumpy Space Princess| Hi, Tony! Oh, my Glob. Guys, what are we gonna— oh.
Lumpy Space Princess| So, should we say something to Tony?
Lumpy Space Princess| You guys!  TONY, JESSICA'S CHEATING ON YOU!
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob.
Lumpy Space Princess| Look, I'm sorry. I know it's none of my business. I know, I—
Lumpy Space Princess| Because I think Tony has a right to know, Stephanie!
Lumpy Space Princess| Nuh-uh, Miranda, I do not like Tony.
Lumpy Space Princess|  No, Jessica! Don't cheat on Tony with me!
Lumpy Space Princess|  
Lumpy Space Princess|  Ah!  Oh, Glob!  Oh, no! Aah!    Oh, Glob.
Lumpy Space Princess| I came upon a tribe of villagers.
Lumpy Space Princess|  
Female Fat Villager|  Monster!
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, I'm so hungry! 
Male Fat Villager| Monster! 
Lumpy Space Princess| Ah! 
Another Fat Villager| Monster! 
Lumpy Space Princess| Anyway, then I found this windmill, and whenever I get hungry, I dress up like the monster and I go eat all the villagers' crops.
Finn| LSP, you're stealing!
Lumpy Space Princess| Don't say that.  You're makin' me feel bad. 
Lumpy Space Princess| Thanks, Finn.
Finn| LSP, if you wanna feel better, you should apologize to the farmers and make amends.
Lumpy Space Princess| Really?
Jake| Yeah, that'll work.
Fat Villager| Monster! Monster! Monster! Monster!
Lumpy Space Princess| No. No, wait!
Fat Villagers|  Monster! Monster!
Lumpy Space Princess| I'm not a monster! I was just pretending to be a monster.
Fat Villagers| Uh?
Lumpy Space Princess| I'm sorry that you're starving because I ate all of your crops, even though you're all still really fat, and I probably helped you lose some weight.
Fat Villager| Did she just call us fat?
Lumpy Space Princess| Don't get all bent out of shape! I'm just being honest!
Finn| LSP!
Lumpy Space Princess| What?
Finn| That apology was terrible!
Fat Villager| Look, the monster eats while it apologizes! Let's kill it!
Lumpy Space Princess| Please don't kill me!
Fat Villager| We have to!
Finn| Well, you don't have to.
Jake| Yeah, you could just let her go.
Fat Villager| If we let her go, she'll keep eating our crops, and we'll starve!
Lumpy Space Princess| Why don't you just get your parents to buy you more crops?
Fat Villager| We are parents! Those crops were for our children!
Lumpy Space Princess| You guys are parents? Just like my parents...  
Finn| LSP, are you okay?
Lumpy Space Princess| Yeah, Finn, I'm great. Here,  I want you to have these sandwiches.
Fat Villagers|  Sandwiches.
Lumpy Space Princess| Yeah, they're really good. They're made with a lot of love.
Finn| It's working!
Lumpy Space Princess| I saved the village!
Lumpy Space Princess|  And that's how I saved the village! 
Lumpy Space King| Well, we're just glad you're home.
Lumpy Space Princess| Whatever.
Lumpy Space King| And thank you, Finn and Jake.
Finn| No problem.
Jake| Yeah, we didn't really do that much.
Jake|  Here, try throwing this one.
Jake|   Here's one called Caturday Surprise.
Finn|  Throw it!
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeah, go on, get out of here!  Unless you feel like a fist cookie, you better keep runnin'!
Finn|  What the heck is goin' on?
Jake|  I have no idea. But it's probably best to stay out of it.
Finn|  Yeah. Hey, look.  This one looks stupid. Let's see how it flies!  Aw, lame. 
Jake|  Uh-oh...
Princess Bubblegum|   Duke of Nuts!  What have you done?!
Duke of Nuts|  Oh... 
Finn|  Oh no! She thinks that nuts guy did it. We gotta go clear up what happened!
Dr. Ice Cream|  Don't worry, my dear. I'll have you fixed up in no time!
Finn|  Princess!  Are you OK?
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeah, I guess if green and bald is okay.
Jake|   Oh boy. I'm sorry! I can't stop now.
Dr. Ice Cream|  My dear, not to worry! The medicine milk in this suit will have you healed lickety-split! In just five days you'll be back to your beautiful bubblegummy self.
Princess Bubblegum|   Five days?! The Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty is tonight! 
Finn|  Uh... hey, Princess. There's something I should tell you about that bottle that hit you in the face.
Princess Bubblegum|  I already know, Finn! The Duke of Nuts has always been a bad guy. But now that he's done this, I'll never forgive him! And it's not just because I hate the Duke! I'd never forgive anybody who did this to me! I'd hate them!
Finn|  Yeah but-
Princess Bubblegum|  FOREVER!
Finn| Forever?!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finally. I have a witness to his misdeeds!
Jake|  Two witnesses!
Finn|  Jake!
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh Finn, my flawless, flawless champion, bring the Duke of Nuts to justice. The justice of a cold dungeon! 
Jake|  Heheh. She's completely bonkers.
Finn|  What do I do? If I tell her I threw it, she'll hate me forever!
Jake|  Don't worry!  That won't happen. We're gonna catch that Duke!
Finn|  But we're the ones who threw the bottle!
Jake|  Dude, look. The Duke of Nuts is bad guys.
Finn|  How do you know that?
Jake|  Think about it. If Bubblegum hates him so much, then he must have done some rotten stuff. I mean, maybe he even threw a bottle and turned someone ugly before.
Finn|  Maybe you're right.
Jake|  Maybe I am!
Finn|  Alright, just this once, we'll be vigilantes!
Jake|  Nah, we're more like cops. Crooked cops! 
Finn|  Princess! I won't rest until the villainous duke is captured!
Princess Bubblegum|   Oh, thank you, Finn! 
Finn|  Woah. Okay, and by then, hopefully you'll have taken care of...this. 
Finn|  Look yonder! The Duke of Nuts castle!
Finn|  Duke of Nuts!
Jake|  How are you?
Finn|  By order of Princess...
Finn|   Um, Princess...  
Duchess of Nuts|  Hello, Finn. Are you here to arrest the Duke?
Finn|  How did you know?
Duchess of Nuts|   The nuts told me...for I am the Duchess of Nuts!
Jake|   Oh... should've asked if these were, like, her eggs or something.
Duchess of Nuts|  I know of my husband's crime against the princess. A crime that you personally witnessed! And why would you lie? Huh?
Finn|  Yeah, why?
Duchess of Nuts| Oh but he was once such a wonderful man! He'd pet dogs, kissed babies; we'd lie together underneath the cashew bush. He even taught under-privileged nuts how to dance. But somehow he's gone rancid! These nuts tell me he must be executed. Would you like to hear what my nuts have to say?!
Finn|  That won't be...um...necessary.
Duchess of Nuts|  Listen! Listen!
Jake|  Woah!
Finn|  I don't get it, Jake. How can the dude be evil if he pets puppies, kisses babies, and lies with his wife?
Jake|  What?! You believe that? She is nuts. Listen, man. Let's just go back and face the music. Who cares if Bubblegum hates you forever? It's no biggie. Tons of people hate me!
Squirrel|  Why, Jake? Why won't you print my letters? I...I...I HATE YOU!
Finn|  Hmm.   It's him! The Duke of Nuts!
Finn|   I'll break left! You take the right! 
Jake|  I went left too!
Finn|  Wha-?  You're way smaller than I thought you were!
Jake|  Dude. That's not him.
Marquis of Nuts|  No one will harm the Duke of Nuts! I will kill whoever seeks to arrest him!
Duke of Nuts|  No! Please! This has gone far enough!
Jake|  That's the Duke of Nuts.
Marquis of Nuts|  But I vowed to kill whoever did this to you. They can't take you away, Dad! 
Duke of Nuts|  Who's the toughest little nut? That's you.   One second.
Finn|  Man, I don't know, Jake. Why would Princess Bubblegum hate him if he's such a nice guy?
Jake|  Just because he's a good father, doesn't necessarily mean he isn't a villain.
Finn|  That doesn't look like a villain.
Jake|  I can probably think of a reason why that's villainous if you gave me enough time. Maybe.
Finn|  Ugh! Maybe we should just confess. But then, Princess Bubblegum will hate us forever.
Jake|  Hey man, it's not that bad being hated.
Squirrel|  C'mon man, pick it up!
Squirrel|  You son of a bleeblop!
Duke of Nuts|  Oh! Sorry to make you wait. I made these daisy crowns for you guys as a- as a token of gratitude for waiting.  Oh...sorry I....I have to sit down for a second. I know this is an odd question, but you wouldn't happen to have any pudding on you, would you?
Finn|  Actually yeah, I think I have one in my pack.
Duke of Nuts|  Oh, thank goodness.
Finn|  I think I have a spoon in here too- wha-?
Jake|  What happened to the cup?
Duke of Nuts|  Oh, I'm so embarrassed! Now you know my shame. I can't stop eating pudding.
Finn|  What?!
Duke of Nuts|  I don't tell people because I hate making them worry, but yes, I have a rare condition. A pudding deficiency. And I always end up eating all of the royal pudding supply whenever I go to the castle.
Finn|  So that's why Princess Bubblegum hates you!
Duke of Nuts|  Yes, but I didn't turn Princess Bubblegum green and bald! I would never do such a thing!
Finn|  Gah! Of course you wouldn't! You're too nice a guy. I'm the one who threw that bottle. I was gonna tell her, but then-- she started talking all crazy-- she said she'd never forgive me and I-- I didn't know!
Duke of Nuts|  Hey, it's okay. People make mistakes. It's all part of growing up and you never truly stop growing.
Finn|  Now you're making me feel even worse by being so nice about it.
Duke of Nuts|  Maybe I should just confess the crime and end all of this.
Finn|  Wait...I think I might have an idea that will save everyone's reputations.
Finn|  Halt!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn! Did you find the duke yet?
Finn|  Not yet, but you are in grave danger, Princess. There is an assassin in these very woods, dead set on stopping you from reaching the Grand Meeting. In fact, what's that rustling in the bush??
Jake|   Rustle. Rustle, rustle.  I'm an ambush! Halt!
Finn|  What's going on?!
Jake|  Oh,  Did I come out to early?
Finn|   What are you here to do, stranger?
Jake|  I've come for the princess. I'm an assassin!
Princess Bubblegum|  Um, guys?
Finn|  Stand back! I will stop him! Hi-yah!
Jake|  Hi-yah!
Jake|  I will kill you! And raise your children as my own!
Finn|  Hi-yaah!
Jake|  Hah!
Finn|  Remember, it's just acting, Jake!
Jake|   Sorry, dude!  Now, to kill you up. But wait, surely this cannot be the fair Princess Bubblegum! Where are her pink, flush cheeks? The long gooey hair?  Clearly, the princess travels elsewhere.  Later, Bubblegum!  Get out there, man!
Duke of Nuts|   I don't know if I can do this.
Jake|  Go, go, go, go!
Duke of Nuts|  And that's how I, the Duke of Nuts, by disfiguring you beyond all recognition, humbly saved your life.
Jake|   Yeah, alright!
Finn|   Yeah!
Princess Bubblegum|  What was the point of this little play again?  And why isn't the duke clapped in irons?!
Duke of Nuts|  She's right. Innocent or not, I should accept what's coming to me.
Princess Bubblegum|  Peppermint Butler! 
Finn|  Oh, no!
Duke of Nuts|  Nuttin's going my way today.
Finn|  No!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn?
Finn|  The duke didn't throw that bottle! Ahh- Princess, I have something sucky to confess. I'm the one who threw the bottle.  I'm sorry, but I knew if I told you, you'd hate me forever!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hmm...well, I could never stay mad at you forever. And you seem genuinely penitent.
Finn|  I don't even know what that means, but thank you!
Princess Bubblegum|   But that doesn't douse my hatred for the duke!
Finn|  Yeah, what's up with that hate?
Princess Bubblegum|  That jerk always empties out my pudding pantry!
Finn|  Aw, shucks. He just can't control himself around pudding. He goes cocoa-nuts for it! Because he has a pudding deficiency!
Duke of Nuts|  It's true, your majesty. I'm sorry for my medical condition.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, my, you poor man! Of course you're forgiven!  Yeah, I don't believe a word from him.
Finn|   I'm really sorry about making you temporarily ugly, Princess. Especially before the Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. I wish there was some way to make it up to you.
Princess Bubblegum|  Maybe there is, Finn. Maybe there is... hey! 
Finn|   Hmm, what? You said maybe.
Turtle King|   Call to order the sesquicentennial Grand Meeting of Ooo Royalty. I now call upon the delegate from the Candy Kingdom. Princess Bubblegums?
Finn|  Ahem! It would be presumptuous indeed to present myself against the distinguished princess to whom you have listened.
Jake|   Buy a lady a drink?
Finn and Jake|   The Marquis of Nuts?!
Marquis of Nuts|  Yes, but I didn't come alone!
Squirrel|  Remember me, Jake?!
Jake|  ...nope.
Jake| Pussy cat! Come here!
Jake|  Hey!
Jake|  Help!
Finn| Don't worry! His spells never last long.
Jake|  Who are these guys? This is a great fight!
Finn|  Yeah! You never fought them? They come out every day at four o’clock on the dot.
Jake| I guess that's because I meet Lady Rainicorn every day at four o'clock on the dot. Oh shoot! I'm late!
Finn|  You should stay, man. At five o'clock every day, I chop both their heads off, and they grow them back for the next day.
Jake|  Aw, man, that sounds awesome! I do want to stay and fight those guys, but I also want to hang out with my girlfriend.
Finn|  Boo!
Jake|   I should probably go. I'll see ya later, buddy. 
Finn|  Bye! Hyaaaaaaaaah! 
Jake|   Oh!
Jake|  Sorry! Sorry I'm late. Finn and I were fighting this shark and science cat, and I lost track of time. Anyway, I’m here now, M'lady, and I have brought to you half an orange.
Lady Rainicorn|  Ooh! 고마워!  
Jake|  Nice! Now make that green! 
Jake|   Ha ha ha! Yeah, that's good.
Lady Rainicorn|   자러 가야겠다. 
Jake|  Sleep! But we were supposed to play viola together!
Lady Rainicorn|  미안해. ]  니가 늦게 왔잖아. 
Jake|   Yeah. Sorry again for coming so late.
Lady Rainicorn|  잘 자.   Jake
Shelby|  Hi Jake.
Jake|  Oh, hey, Shelby.
Shelby|  Why you looking so down in the dumps?
Shelby|  No response, huh? Guess you're good.
Jake|  I'm fed up, Shelby!
Shelby|  Hmm?
Jake|  Whenever I hang out with Lady Rainicorn, I miss out on fun times with Finn.
Jake|  And then when I hang out with Finn, I'm missin' out on Lady Rainicorn!  Oh!
Shelby|   Hey, Jake, why don't you just hang out with both of them at the same time?
Jake|   And then I won't miss anything! Shelby! My problems are solved.
Jake|  Ah, isn't this great? This is totally great.  Isn't it?
Finn|  Yeah.
Jake|   Isn't it?
Lady Rainicorn|  맞아.  
Finn|   What? What did she say?
Jake|  She said she also thinks it's great.
Finn|  Oh.
Jake|  Yeah.
Jake|  Hmm...  Hey, did you know that you both have an awesome sense of humor?
Finn|  We do?
Jake|  Yeah! Anybody have a joke?
Finn|  Oh, I have a joke!  Okay,  okay. Knock knock.
Lady Rainicorn|  누구세요 
Jake|"  She said, ""who's there?"""
Finn|  Diarrhea!
Jake|  쟤가 설사래. 
Lady Rainicorn|  어, 나도 들었어. 뭐야, 하나도 재미없잖아.  
Finn|  Did she say diarrhea who?
Jake|"  Uh, no. No, she didn't say, ""diarrhea who?"" She didn't... say it. Lady, how 'bout you tell a joke?"
Lady Rainicorn|"  글쎄.. 뭐가 있었을까? 아! 우리 완전히 다 벗고 상추밭 미친듯이 뛰어다닌 거 기억 나?  그 농부 아저씨 완전 맛이 갔었지!  That farmer got crazy mad!"")"
Finn|  What's the joke?
Jake|  Uhh... well, the joke doesn’t translate very well.
Finn|  Man, I- I might leave. Is it okay if I leave? I kind of want to go fight something.
Jake| Noooo! Don’t leave.  If there was only some way you two could talk to each other directly.  Oh, dude! I just remembered! There's a universal translator device at the bottom of Lake Szelezon!
Finn| The lake guarded by evil Lake Knights?
Jake|  Yeah, I can't remember why I threw it in there. Let's all go and get it!
Finn|  Whoa   Jake! You’re inviting Rainicorn? No offense, but isn't she a little too sweet for deadly adventure?
Jake|  Trust me, Finn, she’s the Rowdy Queen. She can do anything!
Finn|  Hmmm. Alright! Trust pound!
Finn|  Underwater camouflage!
Finn|  Lady! You are incredible! You should adventure with us all the time!
Jake|   All according to plan.
Lady Rainicorn|  고마워, 나도 재밌었어. 
Finn|  Uhhh, what?
Jake|   Here's the translator.  Let’s see here.  The voice options are... Old man, nerdy alien, ooor nightmare?  Try sayin' something toots!
Lady Rainicorn|   ... and then I ate all the peaches in the orchard, and that farmer was sooo angry!
Finn|   I like this voice!
Lady Rainicorn|   
Lady Rainicorn|   ...and that's the end of my story.
Jake|   Well, at least with old man option we can understand him, I MEAN HER! I mean you sugar!
Lady Rainicorn|  Hop on my back and I'll give you a ride home!
Finn|   Whatever you say grandpa!  Hai-yah!
Lady Rainicorn|  Come on my darling. Wrap your legs around me.
Jake|   I remember why I drowned that translator now.
Finn|  Hey grandpa, how are you able to fly if you don't have wings?
Lady Rainicorn|  Well, light travels from the sun. Then bounces off of our planet and then back into our eyes so we can perceive color.
Jake|  Whoa! 
Lady Rainicorn|  My body can intercept that light and dance around on it. 
Jake|  Lady! It's a little rocky in the back seat here!
Finn|   Shmow!  That forest wizard is giving away free power rings!
Lady Rainicorn|  Do you wanna try gettin' some Finn?
Finn|  Yeahs! 
Jake|   Laaaadyyy!  Fiiiiinn!  Lady!   Lady! Finn!  Y'all around here?  Dang it! 
Finn|   Whoa! Did you see that!? This is like the funnest thing ever!
Jake|   There you are!  Where were you guys?
Finn|  Wait a minute, you didn't fly down with us?
Lady Rainicorn|  We thought you were behind us the whole time!
Jake|  Noooo!  I fell off your tail end!  I was shouting your name!
Lady Rainicorn|   Ooh! Honey pot, we probably couldn't here you because of the cloud density.
Finn|  Jake! Check out these power rings! 
Jake|  Whoa. That's cool! You got ten of them?
Finn|  Yeah! Lady got some too.
Jake|   Oh, that’s cool.
Finn|  Uh, You want one of mine? I’ve got so many.
Jake|  Yeah! Thanks man!
Finn|  Oh. Wait, I can't take them off. I guess they're cursed.  Still pretty cool though.
Jake|  Yeah, they're awesome. 
Finn|    Alright this time I’m gonna destroy you Rainicorn!
Lady Rainicorn|  Oh, okay.  That sounds nice.
Finn|  Oh I got the sword!
Jake|  Hey, Lady, you wanna go play music together or somethin'?
Lady Rainicorn|  Oh, oh. Uh, I would, but I-I'm in the middle of this game.
Jake|  Oh.  Hey Finn. After this next game do you wanna go adventurin' with me?
Finn|  Lady and I are going to a party in the Cloud Kingdom tonight.  You should go to that with us.
Jake|  Humph! Humph Humph Humph!  
Finn|  Jake stop sighing you're messing up my game!  Jake!  What’s goin' on with you!
Jake|  Mmmm, Nothin'!
Finn|  Awww dang it! Man, Lady, you’re too good at this! Hey, It's time to party with clouds! Jake, you comin'?
Jake|  No!
Finn|   Dude, I thought you wanted to spend more time with me and Lady together?
Jake|  I do. 
Finn|  Then come on.
Jake|  No YOU go ahead!  And YOU have fun with MY girlfriend!
Finn|  Uhhh...  We're gonna head to the party, but you should meet us there and stop acting weird. 
Jake|   
Jake|    They should be back by now! 
Cloud man|  Hello Cloud Kingdom.
Jake|  Uh, yes, hello. Um, I’m lookin' for Finn the Human and Lady Rainicorn.  Hello, can you hear me? Hello.
Cloud man|  Yeah, they left a while ago.
Jake|  A while ago?!
Jake|   What the-! 
Finn|    Yeah! Now make that orange!  And make that purple!  Wow Lady! Hanging out with you it the best!
Lady Rainicorn|  I like you too Finn.
Jake|"  Nooo  oooooo! My girlfriend... in the arms of my best pal!  Well, TWO can play at that game, sweet cheeks!  Let's see... ""Doug, Todd, Jerry, Dennis, Reggie, Peter, George, Larry, Luke, David, Benton, Mike R., Mike H., Mike A., Gareth, Jennings, Mr. International, Mr. Outrageous, Captain Majesty, The Flying Lettuce Brothers, Pete the Punk""...  Tiiffaanyy!  PERFECT! Muhuhaha! "
Finn|   Man, I wish Jake was here having fun with us.  Hey, where’s that music coming from?
Jake|  Yeah, yeah, louder.
Lady Rainicorn|    Jake what are you doing?
Jake|  Oh, hey guys. I'm just sharing a tender moment with my beautiful friend Tiffany.
Finn|  Stop! You're making Lady jealous!
Jake|  Well I’m trying to make you both jealous!
Finn|   Why would I be jealous of Tiffany?
Jake|  Becaaause, Tiffany's a boy! 
Tiffany|   Jake's MY best friend now! FOREVER!
Finn|     Yaaaaaaahhh!  Home wrecker! 
Lady Rainicorn|  Jake, what's going on with you?
Jake|   I guess I'm just jealous of how much you and Finn like each other.
Lady Rainicorn|  I'm hanging out with Finn because you wanted us to get to know each other better.
Jake|  I know. Gaah.
Finn|   Get out of my life Tiffany! And never come back 
Tiffany|   No! Jake will be mine!
Jake|  I'm sorry I'm an idiot baby. Forgive me?
Lady Rainicorn|  Oh sweet potato, I love you BECAUSE you're an idiot. You make me feel like a genius!
Jake|   You make me feel like I'm huggin' an old man. It's time to get rid of this piece of crud. 
Lady Rainicorn|   이게 더 좋아? 
Jake|  Yeah! Waaay better! 
Finn|  Beat it Tiffany! Go on! Get!
Tiffany|  You'll never defeat me! I will! Be Jake's best friend! Because I'm! Tiffanyyyy  Ahhhhhh!
Jake|   I'm sorry I was an idiot. Forgive me?
Finn|  Shut up man, I don't wanna hear that stuff.  Lemme get in there.
Jake|  Let's never be stupid again.
Finn|  Wait! Let's always be stupid! Forever!

"""Victor Marilyn"""| Hello there, young lady. I heard you lay down some serious rhymes earlier.  My card.
Flame Princess|  Victor Marilyn? 
"""Victor Marilyn"""| I'm a talent scout by trade and, uh...  and I'd love to book you for a big-time rap battle next week Rap Fest Aid.
Flame Princess| Whoa. I've never heard of Rap Fest Aid.
Finn| It sure sounds like the big time.
"""Victor Marilyn"""| But before I can book you anywhere, I'm gonna have to have you sign some waivers and release forms. Boilerplate stuff. Don't bother reading it.
Flame Princess|  Okay. 
"""Victor Marilyn"""|  Okay! I'll get this paperwork processed, and we'll be in business. 
Finn| Toronto!
Toronto|  Yes, it's me! And I'm making my move from second banana to top dog. As stated in the contract that you just signed, if you lose Rap Fest Aid, the Fire Kingdom becomes my property.
Flame Princess|  What?!
Finn| Aw, don't worry. Look at this mug. You could out-rap him any day of the week.
Toronto| Oh, you won't be facing me. You'll have to beat the most gifted rapper of our time. Son of Rap Bear! See you in a week. 
Finn and Flame Princess|  Son of Rap Bear?
Finn| I wonder if he's any relation to Rap Bear.
Flame Princess| Rap Bear lives in there?
Finn| It's surprisingly nice.
Finn| Knock knock.
Rap Bear|  Who's there?
Finn|  Rap Bear. What happened?
Rap Bear|  My son and I were having Sunday dinner. We were lightly rapping back and forth. It turned into a rap battle. He threw out rhyme after rhyme. I couldn't keep up.
Finn| You got beat by your own son? Are his rap powers that much greater than yours?
Rap Bear| Yes. Why are you asking about my son?
Finn| Flame Princess is going up against him one on one in a freestyle battle.
Rap Bear|  That kid will take you apart.  He rapped my legs off.
Finn| Rap Bear, Son of Rap Bear's father, said his son, Son of Rap Bear, would be at tonight's open mic.

Flame Princess| Son of Rap Bear is right. I just rap about rapping. I haven't traveled the world or done anything really. Finn! Let's go on some adventures!
Finn| What?
Flame Princess| It would really help me build up some quick life experience.
Finn| I don't know if life is like a test you can cram for.

Finn| That was good!
Flame Princess| I thought trying new things would make me new and interesting, but I just feel like a hack.
BMO| Maybe there is an interesting thing about you that you just don't realize. Like how Neptr only just found out there is a face on his can, and now he thinks the can is his conjoined twin.
Neptr| I don't expect you to understand the bond I share with my family.
Flame Princess| Family...
Flame King| No room for the body. Let's make him swim.
Flame Princess| Knock knock.
Flame King| Is that you, Bun Bun? Aah!
Flame Princess| Hi Dad.
Flame King| You're not here to put me back in lantern jail, are you?
Flame Princess| I guess I wanted to talk.
Flame King| Oh.
Flame Princess| It seems like lot's changed since I last saw you. Maybe we actually have a shot at putting the past behind us and, I don't know, being normal with each other.
Flame King| I know exactly what you're saying. I've totally gotten over being in lantern jail, so we're good.
Flame Princess| Well, I was kind of hoping you could acknowledge hurting me, like-
Flame King| Phoebes, come on. It's better to be thankful for what you have now; an awesome chipmunk dad! ... Uh, I'm gonna put on some music. You're totally welcome to listen, or not. Totally up to you.
Flame Princess| So you won't even apologize?
Flame King| Ugh. Drama.
Toronto| What's up, Rap Fest Aid?!  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the battle for the Fire Kingdom! To my left, we have the Flame Princess.
Toronto| And to my right, the reigning champion, Son of Rap Bear!
Son of Rap Bear| Yo.

Son of Rap Bear| She's choking!
Flame King|  Hi, Phoebe!
Flame Princess| Huh? Dad, you came to see me rap?
Flame King| No, I had no idea you were in this. Isn't that crazy? Don't feel bad about losing, though! He's way out of your league!

Toronto|  The winner is Son of Rap Bear!
Son of Rap Bear| ♪ I thought I was the Glob of rap, rivaled by none ♪♪ But I'm more like bubble wrap 'cause she squashed me for fun ♪
Flame King|  She's actually not bad.  Hey, honey! You're actually not bad!
Jake|  Ommmmm... 
Finn|   Jake! What am I supposed to be meditatin' about?
Jake|   Don't know. I'm thinking of pillows stuffed with spaghetti.
Princess Bubblegum|  Clear your minds.
Princess Bubblegum|  I have to go check on something!
Finn|  Can we go with?
Princess Bubblegum|  ...Perhaps you are ready to go with.  Guys, you'll need to put these on.  Pull back your hat.
Jake|  Neat!
Princess Bubblegum|  Stay close to me. . Peppermint Butler appears and blows a huge bubble which engulfs the trio.]
Finn|  Whoa!
Princess Bubblegum|  At the heart of this tree is an ancient evil, held in a prison of amber—the Lich.
Finn|  What's that sound?
Princess Bubblegum|  He's casting spells—trying to get in your head and control your bod... but these gems are protecting our minds from his influence. If we lost the gems, we'd be defenseless.  He would have full control over us.
Finn|  That's freakin' nuts!
Princess Bubblegum|  Beyond Iceberg Lake lies the ruins of the Lich's tower, where he was converting the planet's life force into unholy power to destroy all of Ooo... but before he could, the Legendary Billy attacked him and pummeled him into the resin of this tree.  I—WHAT THE NUTS?!
Finn|  Dude, be a big sword!
Jake|  Oh, okay! I'll try!
Princess Bubblegum|   Quickly! To the other secret room!  There's only one known weapon that can harm the Lich.  The Gauntlet of the Hero.
Voice|  BIIILLYYYYYYY!!!
Jake|  Billy's big ol' beef fingers!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, you have but one chance. While the Lich isn't at full power, you must smite him with this gauntlet!  His only desire... is to destroy life.   If you fail... he'll kill everyone.
Finn|  No. That will not happen.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, and there's something else that I want you to have. The Lich's lair is supposed to be cold. ...I just don't want you to get sick.  Take this sweater. I made it myself.  I'm not great at knitting, but please wear it. I care about you, Finn.
Finn|  I love it.
Jake|  Me, too!
Ice King|    Hey hey hey!  So... I've been thinking about this a lot lately and, well, uh... phew, gosh, I'm so nervous... Finn, and Jake, will you give me your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum?
Jake|  What is wrong with you?!
Ice King|   What's wrong with me?!  No!  Not the latch!
Princess Bubblegum|  Quickly now, Finn! Track the Lich by his trail of death.
Finn|  Here I go!
Jake|  Here I go!
Princess Bubblegum|  Be safe!
Jake|  This is our first fate-of-the-world deal!
Finn|  Yeah, man! We gotta shut this fool down hardcore!
Jake|  Running this fast makes my stomach hurt!
Finn|  Run through it, man!  We gotta get beyond Iceberg Lake before the Lich!
Ice King|  Oh, my! How clumsy of me!
Finn|  What the heck, Ice King?!
Ice King|  Hey, wait, you guys! I'm serious about Bubblegum! Look, I wrote her name all over my arms and legs! 
Finn and Jake|  Yugh!
Ice King|  Guys! It's not fair! She always hangs out with you, and it's not like you wanna marry her!
Finn|   Why are you following us?! 
Ice King|  Whoa!  I told you already. I want your blessings so I can marry Princess Bubblegum!  Come on, guys, give me permission to marry her! I'll... I'll do a little dance for you!  Hmm? You like this?
Finn|  No!
Ice King|   Oh, come on! If you bless our wedding, then maybe she'll really love me.
Finn|   Ice King, go away, man.
Ice King|  I will! When you bless our wedding!
Finn|  No thanks, guy. Hmm? How does this gauntlet  work?!
Jake|  Whoa!
Finn|  I can't turn it off!
Jake|  Punch it in the eye!
Finn|  Phew!
Jake|  Let's blow this stand!
Ice King|   I tried to do this right, but you've driven me to this—driven me to bad doing.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, Finn and Jake, please be okay.  Please be okay... please be okay...
Ice King|  Eh... stupid thing... come on... eh...
Princess Bubblegum|  Ice King?! Get outta here!!
Ice King|  I didn't want to do this, but by not blessing our wedding, Finn and Jake have forced me to kidnap you.
Princess Bubblegum|  That's insane!
Ice King|  I know! But I'll show them... I'll show them how they've hurt us!
Princess Bubblegum|   NO!!
Jake|  There! Out over the lake!
Finn|  After his butt!
Jake|   I'm your dingy dog!
Finn|  Here! I'll help paddle!  Hey. It's me.  Aw, come on. I'm sorry I punched you in the ball.
Jake|  Waaaah!
Finn|  Ah, yeah, haha! Closing in... Gonna get you, man!  Closer, Jake!  Closer... closer...
Ice King|  Ah!
Finn|  PRINCESS?! NO!
Ice King|  Oh, no.  Oh, gross. This water stinks.
Finn|   ICE KING!!
Ice King|  Look! Look what you've made me do to her!
Princess Bubblegum|  Guys! Don't let the Lich reach his well of power!   Oh, no!! He's made it!!
Finn|  Don't worry, Princess!
Ice King|  Hey, where're you guys goin'? What's goin' on?
Finn|  I don't have time for this!
Jake|  Then let's go!
Finn|  My pack!!
Jake|   It's okay!
Ice King|   Man... I-I wanna go after them, but... that hole looks scary, doesn't it?  Well! Holes are holes! 
Finn|  The Lich!
Jake|   He's gettin' his powers back! Weird!
Finn|  No!  Prepare thyself... to get smote in the name of Bubblegum!!
The Lich|   Shhhh...
Ice King|   Yep! Holes are holes! NYEH!! 
Jake|  Look out!!  That's it! I'm gonna bark 'im!
The Lich|  Finn...
Finn|  Oh, no.
The Lich|  Finn...  Come...
Finn|   STOP!!! 
The Lich|  Aren't you cold... Finn...?  Walk into the well... Finn... Aren't you cold...?
Finn|  NO, I'M NOT!! I'VE GOT A SWEATER ON!!
The Lich|  You are a joke to me!! 
Finn|   This sweater... It's keeping me safe!
Princess Bubblegum's voice|  I care about you, Finn...
Finn|  This is it. The ultimate weapon against evil—the power of... l-l-l-l...llliking someone a lot.  LICH!!!
Jake|  Finn!! Buddy!!
Finn|   Jake?  Jake!
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, Finn... you did it!
Ice King|  We did? Hey, yeah, we did it!! Oh, you guys! This experience has brought us all so much closer together! Princess, I'm sorry for all of this. I love you, and I've decided to set you free.  Go free!!
Ice King|  Uh... Whoops, I've got the dropsies!
Right Guard| I'm scared it'll come back tonight.
Left Guard| Me too.
Right Guard| Can we hold hands?
Left Guard| I need my hand to hold my spear.
Right Guard| Why don't you use your other hand?
Left Guard| Oh, that's a good idea. 
Right Guard| But... I need this hand to hold my spear.
Left Guard| Use your other one.
Right Guard|  Aw, it won't reach.
Left Guard| Oh no.
Right Guard| Wait! 
Left Guard| Oh-
Both guards|  Oh!
Left Guard| Hooray.
Right Guard|  This is less scary because now I won't see the monster coming.
Left Guard| Wow. You know, I just noticed these things have rings on the end. It must be for blowing bubbles. 
Banana Guard| Huh?  It's back!
Banana Guard| Huh?
Jake| Surprise!  Finn, get in here! 
Finn| Hmm. Okay. Yeah!  Sic em, Jake! Ha! 
Jake| Feeling good, buddy?
Finn| I'm good. But this chump's about to get slain!
Jake|  Slay him quick. He's got crazy devil strength!
Finn| No prob. Here comes the slay...
Fern face| Don't kill me, Finn.
Finn| Um... Here I go!  Mathematical!
Jake| Finn, are you doing the thing?
Fern face| I'm your friend. I'm you.
Finn| Jake, maybe you should slay this guy?
Jake| Aw, dude, you are doing the thing again!
Fern face| I'm you!
Jake| Slay him!
Princess Bubblegum| Thanks again for coming out to coach. The jamboree's always a big morale boost for the troops.
Finn| Yeah. It's, uh, a nice distraction.
Princess Bubblegum| Hmm. So how are you holding up after all the Fern stuff?
Finn| It's been a rough month, PB. I know Fern was an angry guy who tried to kill me, but I still feel awful about the way he went. It's really messing with me.
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, Finn, I'm so sorry. Death is no laughing mat-  Banana guard number 216?! Oh my glob, he's dead!  This is a banana fudge massacre!
Banana Guards|  Princess?! Princess?!
Princess Bubblegum| Guys, what happened?!
Banana Guard| A terrible monster kidnapped squadron five!
Another Banana Guard| It looked like a banana, but it peeled other bananas!
All|  Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Traitor, traitor!
Princess Bubblegum| A banana and fudge monster?! That's candy tech. Okay, who's behind this?  Finn! I need you and Jake to guard the barracks tonight. If this creep comes back and lays a finger on my guards, you show no mercy.
Finn| Um... Yeah, I'll... do my best.
Jake| Finn! Finn, stop showing mercy!
Finn| Oh, no! I dinked it!
Finn| Jake, I'm sorry! I- I couldn't do it!
Jake|  Love you forever, man, but your guilt's hurting the team dynamics.
Finn| I know. I'm gonna go make it right! 
Jake| Cool. I'm gonna make peace with my aging body.
Finn| No mercy this time, banana boy! I don't care why you're doing this or if you have a... a tragic past.  I don't care! I'm hard like that.
Fern face| Don't kill me, Finn.
Finn|  Nope!
Finn| Oh, gross!
Finn| What the heck is my problem?!
Finn| Aw, fudge!
Finn| Huh?! How'd I do that?!
Huntress Wizard| Um, it's getting away.
Finn| Aah! Oh, Huntress Wizard!
Huntress Wizard| Hey, Finn.  Come on! After that booger!
Finn| Thanks for the save, HW.
Huntress Wizard| Mm-hmm.
Finn| You're chasing that grabby banana too, huh?
Huntress Wizard| I'm hunting it. It's an invasive species that's been destroying the local ecosystem with its nasty hot fudge. It's name is the Grumbo. It's a name that I made up just now... because you can't hunt what you can't name.
Finn| Yeah, makes sense.
Huntress Wizard| Hmm.
Finn|  So how you been?
Huntress Wizard| Finn, I saw you falter back there. Why did you hesitate before you dealt the final blow?
Finn|  It keeps happening since I aced Fern. Every time I'm about to wail on some monster, I remember seeing Fern go kaboom... and the guilt paralyzes me. I can't seem to final blow anybody.
Huntress Wizard| I see. Okay, let's vanquish your mental block. Because I'll need your help to defeat the Grumbo. It's a two-huntress job.
Finn| The second huntress is me.
Huntress Wizard| Yes.
Huntress Wizard| The trail goes gold here. I mean, the fudge is still hot, but that squirrel dude just ate most of it.
Finn|  What? No! Ugh, I should have struck when I had the chance! Or not struck Fern when I didn't have the chance? Ugh! I don't even know anymore.
Huntress Wizard| This is just me talking, but it sounds like Fern was already headed down a dark road. Sounds like he was a bad version of yourself that you had to destroy in order to become an even tighter version of yourself. Does that sounds about right?
Huntress Wizard| Looks like we got some hot fudge on our hands. Okay, let's review our roles. When I take out its legs, you strike the underbelly. Got it?
Finn| I can do this. I'm 90% sure I can do this. Gonna slice right through that sweet Fern face.
Huntress Wizard| Shh!
Huntress Wizard| Ready?
Finn|  Yes.
Huntress Wizard| Duck - I guess.
Finn| Huh?
Huntress Wizard| Bicycle kick!
Huntress Wizard| Now, Finn! Coop-degrassi!
Finn| Okay, time to final blow it!
Fern face| Finn, don't you love me?
Finn|  Uh, can we maybe switch roles?
Huntress Wizard|  Not again.
Finn| Oops! Oops. Oops. Oops!
Finn|  HW, let's come back and try tomorrow!
Huntress Wizard|  Okay...
Finn| Huntress Wizard, get out of the way!
Finn| Think, think, think!  Okay, if I can't fix my mind, I gotta fool it.  Attack. Attack. Attack.
Fern face| Finn, help me.
Finn| I'll save you, buddy.
Finn| I did it. Sorry I almost got you killed.
Huntress Wizard| It's cool. It's totally cool. I knew you just needed a push. That's why I very smartly pretended to throw myself in harm's way. 
Finn| No, actually, that's not what did it.
Huntress Wizard| Yeah, right. We both know you're totally in love with me.
Banana Guard| Finn? Are you here to rescue us? Oh, glob! There's someone else here too!
Another Guard| I don't have my peel! Don't look, don't look anyone! 
Finn| It's okay, guys. Huntress Wizard is into natchy living.
Huntress Wizard| Weird. These Grumbo remains are 100% artificial candy flesh - like straight out of a lab.
Finn| I wonder who made him.
Mysterious character| Who indeed? Who is the brilliant puppet master working tirelessly behind the scenes, completely unfazed by this minor, minor setback?  Why, it's me - Uncle G. Ready yourself, Princezzin! Your boy hero will be no match for my next creation.
Finn| Jake? BMO?
Jake| Hey, man, what you doing?!
Finn|  Dude!
Jake| Don't worry, bro. We won't tell anyone about the private time you spend with your wad of Princess Bubblegum's hair.
Finn|  You guys knew?
Jake| Finn, we're roommates. Which is why I'm gonna share my beloved keepsake with you.
Jake|  Babadadaa! My old baby blanket.
Door Lord| Hmmm! Hmmhmmhmmhmm!
Finn| Who are you?
Door Lord| Hmm hmm hmm hmm!
Door Lord| Hmmhmmhmm.
BMO| Noooo!
Door Lord| Hmmhmm!
Finn| Come on!
Finn| I'll get your kid back, toy!
Door Lord| Hmmhmmph!
Jake| That guy must do crazy squats.
Princess Bubblegum| Get back here, you thieving Door Lord! You butt!
Finn| Come on, Bubblegum!
Princess Bubblegum| Finn?
Finn| Marceline! Are you okay?!
Marceline| Yeah.
Finn| Don't worry. We'll get him.
Finn|"  No!  What?  ""This door shall yield to no command save for a song from a genuine band."" What is this gripagrap?!"
Princess Bubblegum|  It's the door of the Door Lord, Finn. We used to lock them up, but they kept breaking out. 'Cause they're Door Lords.
Marceline|   They broke out because you let them live.
Princess Bubblegum|  
Finn|  Hmm? The door said it will open for genuine band. Let's try and music this door open as a quintet.
Jake|  Can I be the jerk it the band? 'Cause that's an important part of a band's success.  Hmph.
Marceline|  I know how to get through this door. We're gonna lay down a chill jam.
Finn|  Hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Marceline|  Just keep it cool. Got that princess?
Princess Bubblegum|  Hmph. 
Jake|  Let's see if you hacks can keep up with my raw talent!
Finn|  It's working! Look at the door!
Marceline|  ...To bury you in the ground... and drink the blood from your... Ugh!
Marceline|  Stop staring at me! Ugh, you threw me off!
Finn| Come on, everybody! Don't stop now. The door was responding to our music! I wonder what it liked or what was missing.
Jake|  Well, I know what's missing. Talent. I'm getting out of here, you hacks! Talentless hacks! 
Marceline|  Yikes.
Finn|  Maybe to be a genuine band we need to be nicer to each other and hang out as buds.  Let's take a noodle break. Come on, it will help!
Finn| No! Wait, don't go, too!
Marceline| I'm just gonna get stuff to cook that.
Finn|  Cook?
Princess Bubblegum| That was sweet what you said about being buds.
Finn| Mm-hmm. Thanks.
Marceline|  I'm back yo! Come here, baby. 
BMO|  Oh.
Princess Bubblegum| For our next attempt, I wanna be the lead.
Finn| Yeah! Sounds cool, my bud.
Jake| Hmph!
Finn| Jake, you're back!
Jake| Shut yo' face. I came back for the music.
Princess Bubblegum| BMO, execute Sound Structure Alpha.  Marceline, begin playing triplet quavers in mixolydian mode.
Marceline|  Alright, fine.  Wait, what's a quaver?
Princess Bubblegum| Now, Finn, vibrate your uvula by dampening and undampening your larynx.
Finn| Wha?
Princes Bubblegum|  Go like this, silly.
Finn|  Oh.  Whaaaa...
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, okay. Jake, are you gonna join in?
Princess Bubblegum|  Everyone, just stick to my blueprints.  
BMO| Oohh...
Finn|  One more time?
Princess Bubblegum| I may have, um... miscalculated.
Marceline| Ha! Looks like you aren't as perfect as you thought. Guess you can't judge me anymore.
Princess Bubblegum| I never said you had to be perfect!
Finn| Alright, time out, guys.
Finn| Princess! Princess, wait!
Marceline|  Whatever,  Ugh! I'm outta here, too! 
Finn| Marceline?
Jake|  You've all forgotten 'bout the music! I quit the band!  I'm just pretending!
Finn| Jake! Everybody! We can beat the Door Lord! ...Together.
Door Lord|  Hmm? Hmmhmmhmm!
Finn| It's over, Door Lord.
Jake| So hand over our stuff.
Door Lord| Hmmhmmhmmhmm. Hmmhmmhmm hmmhmmhmmhmm hmmhmm hmmhmmhmmhmm. Hmm!
Finn| What's he trying to say?
Marceline| I totally get it. He may have stolen our treasures...
Princess Bubblegum| ...But by doing so, he showed us...
Jake| ...That the real treasure is friendship.
Door Lord|  Mmmhmmhmm! Mmmhmm hmmhmmhmm.
Door Lord| Hmm...
Jake| Okay, here's that lock of Bubblegum's hair you love so much.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, you.
Finn|  Ah, yeesh.
Jake| And here's Jakey's blankey.  Here's your controller, BMO.
BMO|  Yippie ki-yi-yay!
Jake| Marceline, here's your rock shirt.
Marceline| Hey, that's not...
Princess Bubblegum|  It's mine! That's mine.
Marceline| You... kept the shirt I gave you?
Princess Bubblegum| Yeah. It, uh, means a lot to me.
Marceline| But you never wore it.
Princess Bubblegum|   Dude, I wear it all the time... as pajamas.
Finn|  Wait, if that's Bubblegum's shirt, what are you missing, Marceline?
Finn| Wait a second, wait a second! You don't have a thing! You just wanted to hang out with us!
Marceline| No, I didn't!
Finn| No way, you're caught! I figured you out! 
Marceline|  I'll kill you!
Finn| These ghoul dudes take the form of whatever you're thinking about.
BMO| An angry -- no, shy shark baby.
Finn| What if life was always just constant fun times on the river?
Jake| Let's never do anything boring ever again.
BMO| Yes, let's never do anything boring ever ag--  Time for Ice King's boring book reading.
Finn| Aw, come on! He's just gonna read those weird stories that are basically about us.
Jake| I kind of dig getting loosely adapted.
Ice King|" Fionna spoke with the voice of an angelic choir. ""You can have the rest of the screaming chili cheese dip if you want,"" she said.  ""It's totally fine."" The end."
Ice King|"  I said ""the end""!"
Turtle Princess| Let's get some questions.
Banana Guard|  Where do your ideas come from?
Ice King| They're beamed into my melon at night - same as everybody else. Next!
Unknown voice| I have more of a criticism than a question.
Ice King|  I am very open to criticism!
Unknown voice| Your story was completely wrong.
Ice King|  And how would you know?
Unknown voice| I know... because I am... Fionna!
"""Fionna"""| I can show you what really happened. It's all on this tape!
Audience| Ooh!
Banana Guard| What format is that?
Fionna| According to this map, we're very close. There's the door.
Fionna| Aw, it's locked.
Cake| I'll get us in with key... eye!
Cake|" Bam! ""Eye"" got it. You get it, Fionna?"
Fionna| Yeah, but it's a stretch.
Other Fionna|  There I am.
Fionna|  Next time we find a map lying in the backyard, we should think twice.
Cake| At least we get this fancy coffin.
Cake| How's it look?
Fionna| It's a decent addition to the treasure vestibule but still kind of a letdown.
Cake| You know what's never a letdown? Cookie sauce review party.
Fionna| Yeah! Cookie dip. Screaming chili cheese versus sriracha ranch.
Peppermint Butler| Was it real?
Banana Guard| Who was filming all that?
Gunter| Wenk, wenk.
BMO| Needs more hunks!
Finn| Dude, I literally have one bazillion questions.  Uh, excuse me, Miss Fionna... Where did this video come fr-o-o-m!
Ice King| Fionna! I always knew we'd meet one day and become best friends. So, uh, remember that time when Cake caught Ruse Goose, the notorious goose pickpocket?
"""Fionna"""| That was such a long time ago.
Ice King| But during trial, you realized she was framed 'cause it was actually Abracadanielle pretending to be a goose all along!
Banana Guard| Can I also ask a question?
Ice King| Besties only.
Banana Guard| I was just gonna ask if we could see more of the tape.
Ice King| Oh, yeah, can we?
"""Fionna"""| I don't think so.
"""Fionna"""| All right, just a little more.
Fionna| Oh... my... glob. It's a mummy!
"""Mummy"""| That's right. I'm a mummy!
Fionna| Aww.
Cake| Yeah, you are. And a real cutie, too.
"""Mummy"""| I'm not cute! I'm horrible! 
Fionna| Wanna hang?
"""Fionna"""| Okay, that's enough.
Ice King and Banana Guard| Aw!
Ice King| I want to see more.
"""Fionna"""| I don't want to wear it out. It's my only copy. And it's very important to me.
Turtle Princess| Library closes in five.  Click, click, click.
Ice King| So, where you heading now?
"""Fionna"""| Guess I'll go back to the dump under the bridge where I live. I'd invite you over, but I don't have a sofa or TV or anything. It's literally a dump.
Ice King| I have a TV. My crib is equipped.
"""Fionna"""| Oh, really?
Ice King| Hey, you should move in! Please live with me, Fionna.
Ice King| This is the sweet spot. My roo--  Oh! I wasn't expecting guests.  Not that you mind a bit of dirt, right?
Ice King| Nice, huh?
"""Fionna"""| So, this is my room now.
Ice King| Only the best for Fionna.
Ice King| Oh yeah, I like this room too. It's where I do all my deep thinking. Man, I still can't believe it-- the Fionna in my bathroom, touching my toothbrush, throwing it into my little trash can. Fionna taking charge!
"""Fionna"""| That's what heroes do.
Ice King| You're a so much better hero than Finn.
"""Fionna"""| I know.
Ice King| Plus, don't tell Jake, but I've always been more of a cat person. Where is Cake the Cat?  Cake? Cake?
"""Fionna"""| Cake is gone. Some years back, there was an adventure mishap. I don't feel comfortable talking about it.
Ice King| Oh, okay.
"""Fionna"""| Hey, you still haven't shown me where you keep your Fionna and Cake tapes.
Ice King| Sorry, no can do.
"""Fionna"""| What? Don't you have tapes?
Ice King| Oh, yeah, I got loads of tapes, but they're super private.
"""Fionna"""| Maybe you'll change your mind once you see more of my mummy adventure?
Ice King| Yay! I'll get snacks.
Fionna| Hey, what's wrong?
"""Mummy"""|  I have... a curse!
Fionna and Cake|  Oh no.
Fionna| How can we save you, tiny mummy?
"""Mummy"""| The curse can only be broken by strong black coffee and fancy muffins from Breakfast Kingdom.
Fionna| I know that place. It has a really long line on weekends.
"""Mummy"""| Yes! That sounds like the one. Be a hero and fetch unto me the sacred breakfast.
Cake| Don't you worry, little guy.
Fionna| We'll save you!
"""Fionna"""| Okay, that's the end of the tape.
Ice King| Really? My stories usually get wrapped up neater.  Wrapped up -- mummies.
"""Fionna"""| Yeah, well, there's no more, so...  You wouldn't know this, but old heroes need a lot of sleep.
Ice King| I did know that.
"""Fionna"""| See you in the morning.
Ice King|  Okay.
Ice King|  Fionna? You awake? I made you a midnight snack.
Fionna|  Mummy, we're home.
Ice King|  I knew it.
Fionna| Where did it go?
Cake| Maybe it had to go back into its coffin Dracula-style.
Fionna| Mummy?
Cake| We got you breakfast.
Fionna| Hmm.
Cake| Shh! What's that?
"""Mummy"""| Nyeh!
Fionna| That's our treasure!
"""Mummy"""| Stay away. You'll get cursed. 
Fionna| I take the curse off of me and put it back on you.
"""Mummy"""| You understand nothing of mummy curses! 
Fionna| Our treasure!
Cake| Our muffins!
Queen of Ooo| Uhh... Do not look upon a naked mummy. It's bad luck.
Fionna and Cake|  Queen of Ooo?!
Queen of Ooo| That's right. I snuck in here to pretend to steal your stash and teach you a valuable lesson. Never invite strangers into your home, no matter how cool they seem and are. You should be thanking me really.
Ice King| Of course. She didn't want me to see the end of the tape because she's not Fionna. She's... a mummy!  Aah!
"""Fionna"""| Come on. They're all just him?
Ice King| Imposter! Reveal yourself! 
"""Fionna"""| Aah! Knock it off!
Ice King| You're the knock-off!
"""Fionna"""| What?
Ice King| You're not Fionna!
"""Fionna"""| How did you--
Ice King| Show me your true form!
Ice King| Aha! Huh? What kind of mummy are you supposed to be?
Rabbit Lady| No kind! I'm just an old lady.
Ice King| Who likes to dress up as Fionna?
Rabbit Lady| It makes me feel confident, okay? Plus I look really good in this outfit.  Look, I used to be very shy, tinkering with my tech stuff all night, sleeping all day. But one evening, I intercepted a strange signal. I was mesmerized. I watched that tape like a hundred times before I finally stepped out of my cave a new woman, determined to find more Fionna and Cake. I roamed Ooo for years with no luck. But then I found out about you, and I hatched a plan to steal your tapes.
Ice King| What? I don't have any Fionna and Cake tapes.
Rabbit Lady| I know! All of your tapes are filled with embarrassing diaries.
Ice King| If I met them, I'd definitely record it.
Rabbit Lady| Fionna and Cake aren't real, you ding-dong! They're just, like, a TV show from the past or something.
Ice King| You're the ding-dong, lady! You tricked an old, defenseless Ice King. 
Rabbit Lady| Look, I didn't mean to hurt you.
Ice King| You lied to me. Fionna would never lie -- never.
Rabbit Lady| Oh, glob, you're right. I'm not like Fionna. I'm the mummy! Oh glob! 
Gunter| Wenk.
Ice King| Huh? Well, that was disheartening.
Rabbit Lady|  Forgive me, Fionna!
Fionna|  Cake, what time is it?
Gunter| Wenk.
Jake|  Happy birthday!
Finn|  Jake! Is that you? I can't see! 
Jake|  Right! That's because-
Finn|  I'm blind?! Jake! I'm blind on my birthday!
Jake|  No dude, you're blindfolded.
Finn|   Oh...
Jake|   Keep the blindfold on. I've got a surprise for you.
Jake|   Surprise!
Finn|   Orange blindfold? That is a surprise!
Jake|  That's not the surprise. This is!
Finn|  You got me a train?  Thank you, Jake!
Jake|   This isn't the gift!
Finn|  Huh?
Jake|  We have to take the train to get to the gift.
Finn|  Oh. Almost as cool as a free train! 
Jake|  I'll go get the tickets.
Finn|  Okay!
Finn|  Hey! Mr. Conductor! It's ma birthday!
Conductor|  Oh? Climb aboard my train, little boy, you're my new friend. He hehe hehehe.  All aboard! 
Finn|  This is gonna be the best birthday ever!
Jake|  Heheh. I'm gonna go grab a schedule! 
Mr. Candy Cane|  Whoa!  Terribly sorry, Colonel!
Colonel Candy Corn|   That's quite alright. Just don't let it happen again. 
Conductor over intercom|  Sorry about that, folks. We're approaching Gumball Gulch now. The rides gonna get a little bumpy until we reach the straight-away and you might wanna buckle up! 
Jake|   Found a schedule!
Finn|  Great! Now find your seatbelt.
Mr. Candy Cane|  Jeez Louise! So sorry about that Colonel!  Beg your pardon!  Sorry! Whoa!! 
Mr. Candy Cane|  Colonel, I am so sorry.
Finn|  Hey! We're in the straight-away!
Mr. Candy Cane|  Oh, I want to see! 
Colonel Candy Corn|  I'm gonna kill you!
Finn|  A skeleton...  Is he going to be okay, Doctor Donut?
Doctor Donut|  He doesn't look good.
Jake|  Hey man, this is kinda a bad scene. Maybe we should get off the train and huff it to your surprise.
Finn|  Are you kidding? It's a murder mystery! On a train!  And we're gonna solve it.
Jake|   Alright.
Finn|  What'dya think, Doctor Donut? Any clues?
Doctor Donut|   Hmm. I think it was the guy would screamed 'I'm gonna kill you.'
Colonel Candy Corn|  No, no! It wasn't me, I swear!
Finn|  Passengers, passengers! I don't think it was Colonel Candy Corn.
Colonel Candy Corn|  Thank you!
Finn|  No, in murder mysteries it's never the first person you think of. Never ever.
Marshmallow Kid|  So who do you think it is?
Finn|   Colonel, do you have any enemies on this train?
Colonel Candy Corn|  Just one! And his or her name is...
Finn|  See? I knew it wasn't him!  But now we need to figure out who his enemy is. It could be anybody.
Green Gumdrop Dude|  It could even be you.
Finn|  Yes it could.  Except I didn't do it.
Green Gumdrop Dude|  But... we don't know that.
Finn|   You singled me out to take suspicion of yourself! Are you Colonel Candy Corn's enemy?
Green Gumdrop Dude|  What? No! I was just trying to join in on the conversation!
Finn|   Suspect numero uno!
Finn|  Rat traps! Really thought I was onto something!
Jake|  Now I know this is going to sound crazy, but what about the conductor?
Finn|  No it's definitely not him.
Jake|   Oh. Why not?
Finn|  'Cause he's weird and creepy. And you never suspect the creepy guy because he's too obvious.
Jake|  Whatever, man. I'm gonna go sit and look at the schedule. 
Finn|  We're running out of suspects. And we're running out of time.
Conductor|  Attention!  Attention passengers!  Nollie, heheheh. Yeah hi, it's me, the conductor. Heheh. Anyway, I couldn't help overhearing that someone thinks I'm weird and creepy. And you know; I'm not weird and creepy.  I'm cool and awesome.  Happy birthday, Finn. 
Finn|  Hey Jake.
Jake|  Yeeeeeeeaaah?
Finn|  The conductor was just here and he was weirder and creepier then before.
Jake|  What?! No way, he was cool and awesome!
Finn|  Anyway, it's still not him. ] No. The murderer is right here among us. ] Isn't that right, Doctor?
Doctor Donut|   You think it was me?
Finn|  When Candy Cane guy was murdered, you diverted suspicion to Colonel Candy Corn.  Then killed him to protect your alibi.
Doctor Donut|  Are you kidding?
Jake|  Dude, I think you're waaay off.
Finn|  Am I? Or am I way on.
Finn|  Son of a-
Finn|  My hunches aren't getting me anywhere! The killer is laughing at us, Jake.
Jake|  What'dya think we should do?
Finn|  Hmmm... We need hard  evidence!
Finn|  Ha!  A basket of eggs, fish and cabbage!
Finn|  It's a receipt! From an earlier train ride. From another train!
Finn|  Jake! I found a book! It's a dictionary!
Finn|  It's sheet music! 
Finn|  It doesn't make any sense to me. 
Jake|  Me neither!  Maybe the murderer is just too smart for us.
Finn|  Yes! Jake, that's it! It's all so clear now! Gather everyone in the caboose and I will reveal a murderer!
Finn|  You're the only remaining passengers. So the murderer, is in this caboose. 
Finn|  Let me explain how I know who the murderer is.  I saw Pineapple Guy skim through the sheet music. Sheet music to a song that's very special to Lollipop Girl. A song that reminds her of Ice Cream Guy.   Before Colonel Candy Corn's aide, Doctor Ice Cream was in possession of a basket of cabbage, fish and eggs.  And you, Pineapple Guy, have cabbage bits on your socks!  And you!  Chocolate Bar Guy!  Does this dictionary look familiar? A dictionary that contains the words  Rid!  Guests!  At once!
Finn|  But the real murderer is someone no one suspects! The real murderer is-
Finn|  No one was the murderer?!
Jake|  The conductor's still on the train!
Finn|  Oh yeah! He did it.
Jake|  Yay, you did it, you solved it, Finn!
Finn|  I knew it; because he's creepy.
Jake|  What?! Humpf.
Finn|  I know. You knew he was the murderer all along. I couldn't have done it without  you, you, you 
Jake|  Thank you.
Finn|  We make a great team, pal.
Finn|  You feel kinda bony.  Jake?  NOOOOOOOOOOO!
Conductor|  Hey.
Finn|  How could you murder all those Candy People?! And, you murdered Jake on my birthday! 
Conductor|  Yes, and you're next.
Finn|   Wrong!
Finn| I'm coming for you!  This is for Jake!  You're going down, or both of us are going down!  My birthday wish, is vengeance!  Happy birthday to me!!
Conductor|  Wait! [Stretches himself around to reveal that it is actually Jake covered in paint.
Finn|   You're alive!!  You were the conductor the whole time?!
Jake|   Yup. You were so focused on the murders because you never even noticed!  The skeletons were the hardest part.  It was all an elaborate set up for your birthday present!
Finn|  So nobody was murdered?
Jake|  Nope! Not unless you count the train's control panel!
Jake|  Dude, open your eyes!
Finn|  Hey, we're alive!
Candy People|  -to you!
Finn|  Wow, this is the best birthday ever. Thanks, Jake.
Jake|  You deserve it, buddy.  Because you're a great friend.
Finn|  I think my favorite part was landing on the Gelatin. That musta taken forever to plan. 
Jake|  Nope! That part was a total accident.
Finn|  Oh. So we could have...
Jake|  Died horribly? Yes. Happy birthday, pal! 
BMO| Football, you don't mean that.
Football| I do, BMO. I don't say things I don't mean. You look very smart and very handsome today.
BMO|  Oh, Football, thank you. I love you so much.
Football| I love you, BMO.
BMO| Ring, ring.  Hello? Football? This is BMO.
Football| Oh, hello, BMO. What a wonderful surprise. What's up?
BMO| Oh, nothing. Just wanted to say that I love you.
Football| I love you, too. Goodbye. Click.
BMO| Can I tell you a secret?
Football| Of course, BMO. You can tell me anything.
BMO| I love you.
Football| Oh. 
BMO| Now you tell me a secret, Football.
Football| I wish I could spend just one day on the other side of the mirror.
BMO| Well, let's switch places for the day.
Football| Oh, BMO, you'd do that for me?
BMO| Yes, Football. Because I love you.
Football| Oh, BMO.
Football| Oh!  Oh! 
BMO|  See you back here tomorrow, Football. 
Finn| Hour ​​six of our Ice Kingdom stakeout. Abso-nothing's going on there.
Jake|  And if I do this hand position,  my boogers should turn into smoke bombs.
Finn| Pfff. You sure this tip is good, Flambo?
Fambo|  Come on, you know I'm on the level. The Ice King is scheming to nabs a princess today. I swears it.
Finn| Hmm.
Jake| Relax, Restless Pants. A true ninja can sense the intentions of his enemies.  Jin.
Flambo|  Ninjas? Ninjas ain't real for nothing, no how.
Finn| Whoa, now—ninjas are real. For you see,  Doo, doo, doo... Jake and I are ninjas.
Jake| Yep, ever since we fished this ninja manual out of a ditch. Finn, booty me!
Finn|  Listen!
Jake| Finn, I think I'm gonna take off my booties. I can't flip these pages.
Ice King| Gunter, let's go! I've got the overnight bag.
Gunter| Wenk, wenk!
Finn| It's the Ice King, all right, and he's looking awful pleased with himself.
Jake| Uh-oh. If the Ice King's so happy, he must have stolen a princess when we weren't looking, somehow.  That's ninja logic.
Finn| Then we gotta...
Flambo|  Ahem.
Finn| ...we gotta save that princess.
Jake| You got it, shino-bro! Ninja kick!
Finn| Ninja kick!
Finn| Princess? Princess!
Jake|  Princess?
Finn|  Princess!
Jake|  Princess? ...Ahh...
Jake| No princess here, man.
Finn| No princess?  It's... a trap! We're being trapped! Ninja vanish! Evade! Evade!
Jake| Nothing is trapped, dude. We can't find any captured princesses, because the Ice King hasn't captured one yet. He's out doin' it right now.
Finn| Are you sure?
Jake|  No. It's only a ninja hunch, so we should ninja snoop for proof.
Finn| Wait, man. I-I feel uncomfortable snooping through Ice King's personal stuff. It feels sorta like...  a violation.
Jake|  Whoo! Got the Ice King's diary.
Finn|  No, no, no, no, no! We can't read his private junk! 
Jake| And yet we must.  Dear diary—and you better write me back this time!—  today I'm bringing home a special new cutie.
Finn| There's our proof, man! ... Hmm, alright. Let's use our ninja stealth and hide until he comes back with the princess.
Jake| Or... we could keep looking through his stuff. Heh, heh, heh! You know, for more proof? Hehehe!
Finn| No.  Alls we're gonna do is lie in wait until the Ice King gets back. Then—BOOM —we catch him with princess on his hands. 
Jake| Where are we gonna hide?
Finn| In this filthy hamper!  Think he's there yet?
Finn| See anything?
Jake| Nah. Hey, Finn, I don't want to hide in the hamper anymore; it reeks in here.
Finn| But we're ninjas! And this is our ninja hideout.
Jake| Nah, man. My sense of smell is, like, one thousand times better than yours. Also, the hamper's boring. I'm out.
Finn| Wait!
Jake| I'm out!
Finn| Jake! Get back here!   Hey, wait up!
Jake| Check this out!
Finn| Weird.
Jake| I want to draw something.
Finn| Hey!  We gotta leave no trace! Ninjas leave no trace!
Jake| I'll delete it after!
Finn| Hey, come on!
Finn|  Jake, what have we done?
Both|  A secret hidden room full of ninja stuff!
Ice King|  Oh, great—a line.  Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.
Rock Man| Uhh, I-I think you were actually ahead of me.
Ice King|  You know I was.   Counter maid, I demand medical attentions,  preferably those of a princessy type.
Rock Nurse| And are you checking in as a patient or a cadaver?
Ice King| Hey! I'm as healthy as ten old men!
Ice King| Ah! Oh, oh, right!  My penguin—he's very, very sick. So... what time does your shift end?
Jake| What kind of guy builds a cave inside of another a cave?  What's this? A spellbook?  Whoo!
Finn| Dude! Leave no trace!
Jake| Ah, it's too late for that.
Finn| It's not too  ...late. WHOA!
Jake| What'cha got there?
Finn| Dude! It's a first-edition Ice Ninja Manual!
Finn|  A true ninja passes no wind; he only passes... 
Jake|  I ain't even heard of these techniques.  Nuh-nuh-n-numm-nuh  numb-chucks.
Finn| Hey. Ice King seems way into ninjas, even more than we are.
Jake|  Yeah, so? 
Finn| So... doesn't that mean that ninjas must be... kinda lame?
Jake| Nah, they're still cool. But Ice King's still lame because he hides his ninja love. We wear our ninja on our sleeves! 
Finn| Jake! Show me how to do that.
Ice King| What's taking that doctor so long? Gunter, make more noise!
Gunter| WUAH! WUAH!
Ice King| Yeah, alright. Don't oversell it, drama queen.
Dr. Princess| Dun, dun, dunnn. Pardon the intrusion. I'm Doctor Princess.
Ice King| Yes, well, uh...  Come to Ice King, Princess.
Dr. Princess|  Don't worry, sir. I specialize in treating little tuxedo people.
Ice King| Just give it to me straight, doc. Am I gonna have to pay for this?
Dr. Princess|  Hmm...
Gunter|  Wenk-wenk. Wenk-wenk. Wenk-wenk.
Dr. Princess| Oh, my!
Ice King| What can you do for him, Doctor Princess?  Without Gunter, I'll be all alone. You see, I'm a widower.
Dr. Princess| Oh, I'm sorry. How did your wife die? 
Ice King| Oh, what? Is that what that means? 
Dr. Princess| Whoa, Nelly! Something medical is happening!
Ice King| Gunter, you're embarrassing me!
Finn|  Fridjitsu master Finn summons... dagger of chilled glass. 
Jake|  Fridjitsu master Jake summons... stars of frozen rain.  Get ready to be... star struck. 
Finn| Get ready to be... cold cut!
Jake| Hyah!
Finn|  Kunai attack!
Jake|  Icicle kick!
Finn|  Force of blizzard!
Jake|  Flying jump!
Finn| What?! Three Jakes? That's one too many. Caltrop hailstorm!  Those Jakes were all fakes!
Jake|  Heh! Fridjitsu master Jake summons... arrow of ice! 
Finn| Hiyah!  Rad.
Both|  WOOHOO! YEAH!
Finn| It's the Ice King! Hide!
Ice King|  Okay, m'dear, this enclosure will be your new home!
Finn|   He's got a princess. Now we leap out and catch him red-handed. 
Jake| Hai!
Finn| Snow blind! 
Jake| Thin ice, thin ice, thin ice! 
Ice King| ...but once you get used to the smell of penguin manure, it's almost tolerable.
Finn| Ice King, hand over that princess!
Ice King| Princess? What?
Finn| Jake, where's the princess?
Jake| Ooh, right.
Ice King| What princess?
Finn| The, um... princess you were just talking to?
Jake| Yeah, the one you just came back from stealin'.
Ice King| Wrong-o. I was at the hospital, for it turns out Gunter here was preggers!
Gunter| Wenk.
Ice King| I was just talking to the egg! It's such a cutie!
Jake| Gunther's a woman?!
Ice King| What? No!  Fuh. Anyway, get out of my house or I'll kill you, et cetera. I want to take a nap in my easy chair.  What happened to my recliner?!
Finn| Ohh...
Ice King| My skins and tubs!
Ice King| You even violated my secret sanctum?! What is wrong with you?!
Finn| No princess?
Ice King| No! No princess!
Finn| We messed up, Jake. We're... violators!
Ice King| Yeah, what the heck?! You think you can just wreck my house and wear my collectibles?!  Hah! Who do you guys think you are?!
Finn| We're... ninjas?
Ice King| You're not ninjas! You're just a couple of jerks!
Finn| It's true.  Ice King, we're gonna make this right.
Ice King| Yeah, do it; make it right. And start by, uh... oh, take my bag over to the cage.
Ice King| Oh, no, no, no! Not that! Never mind! Put that down and go clean my gym equipment.
Finn| Doctor Princess!
Ice King|  Oh, heh... I have no idea how that got in there!
Finn| What's goin' on?
Dr. Princess| I'll field that one.  The Ice King abducted me while I was distracted by the horrifying beauty of birth.
Ice King| Yes, Gunter's ailment was the perfect cover for stealing a princess, M.D.
Dr. Princess|" I'm not even a real princess. ""Princess"" is just a surname. "
Ice King| Enough! You may have uncovered my princess-smuggling scheme, but you'll never leave this place alive!
Jake|  A couple of ninjas like me and Finn can only be defeated by another ninja!
Ice King| Doot, doo, doooo!  Ninja!
Finn and Jake| Ninja! 
Dr. Princess| What am I... looking at here, exactly?
Finn, Jake and the Ice King| NINJA! 
Dr. Princess|  So... how is your egg doing?
Gunter| Wenk, wenk.
Dr. Princess| Oh.
Ice King|  Gunter! Why didn't you tell me?
Gunter|   Weh-weh-wenk.
Ice King| Oh, Gunter...
Rap Bear| Yo! Check, check, one, two! Hey! I'm Rap Bear! I can rap... like that. Ha-ha, I'm back! It's a battle of rhymes. I'm gonna do it this time. I'm Rap Bear. My raps are mystical... quantum physics! Whoo! 
Crowd| Whoa!
Rap Bear| Yeah, yeah!
Jake| Boo! That was pre-written. It's so obvious! Take him out, Finn!
Finn| Off...
Starchie| Nope.
Finn| Off the dome, here we go. Uh! I'm-a start it now. I'm-a battle now. We gonna make a rhyme, so I can rap this time. I rap for millions...  sesquipedalians.
Starchie| Yeah, that was tight.
Finn| Whoo!  Huh? Rap Bear, what's wrong, man?
Rap Bear| How can I be Rap Bear if I'm not the best?
Finn| No way! You are the best! Going up against you was a dream come true. I look up to you, man. You're like... You're like my hero, Rap Bear.
Jake| Awesome.
Rap Bear|  Thank you, Finn.
Party Pat| I thought Billy was your hero.
Finn| Yeah, but Billy's dead, so... Billy.
Billy| Ha-ha! Check out these dummies.
Finn|  Ha-ha! Yeah! You're awesome Billy! Ha-ha!
Monster| You're gonna pay for this, Billy!
Finn| Sick.
Billy|  Billy! 
Party Bear| I love rap music, but only when it's good rap.
Woman| Finn! Finn! Finn.
Finn| Huh? Who dat?
Woman| I'm Canyon, Billy's ex-girlfriend.
Finn| Say what?! That's so weird. I was just—  Party Pat was just like—
Jake| What's going on here? Who's that?
Finn| This is Billy's ex-girlfriend.
Jake| His special Lady?
Canyon| No, his ex-girlfriend.
Jake| Oh, man, I'm sorry. Well, I hope you guys get back together. Whoo-oop! 
Finn| Jake's still in denial about Billy.
Canyon| Billy and I broke up four years ago, but I held on to this. 
Finn|  Billy's loincloth!
Canyon| After Billy died, I couldn't keep it in my place anymore. I heard you guys were friends, so when I saw your name on the rap battle flyer, I thought it would be cool to bring it to you.
Starchie|  Oh, that's some smelly. 
Finn| Thank you, Canyon. I guess I've been in denial, too. Have you been back to Billy's crack?
Canyon| No, I can't.
Finn| It's time to go see Billy's crack.
Canyon| Shouldn't Jake be here?
Finn| He needs more time. This would mess him up too much. 
Finn|  Fairies! Oh, they've infested the place! Okay, you guys, out! This is Billy's crack.
Gnome 1| Billy got aced by the Lich.
Gnome 2| We have dibs on the crack, so beat it!
Finn| I'll dib up your brains if you don't respect the mems of Billy.
Jordan| Flimsy threats! Like a tiny blade of grass in a maelstrom, you are. That storm is me, Jordan, Lord of the Fairies. I ain't afraid of you or this big—
Jordan| You think you can chump me like that? This breeze feels great, doofus!
Jordan's head| All right.
Finn| Laters.
Finn| Um, so, Canyon, why did you and Billy break up?
Canyon| Huh? Oh. Well, I loved Billy, and I believed in him, but then Billy stopped believing, and that jammed up our whole deal—being a top-tier, red-belt power couple. After a while, all he did was watch movies and play video games. Pretty lame, right? So I bailed.
Finn| Even heroes have slumps, bro.
Canyon| Yeah, I know. I heard he was making a comeback, too. What a weird world.
Billy| Billy!
Canyon| What the—? 
Finn| What is it?
Canyon| It looks like Billy's bucket list.
Finn| Whoa, let me see!
Finn|" Hmm. Looks like he got to most of these. He sure lived a full life. Okay, here's one. Wait. ""Tell Finn that thing."" What the butt is that?"
Canyon|  I don't know.
Finn| Okay, that's gonna bother me forever. Well—well, here's one more. We should do it for Billy.
Canyon| What's that?
Canyon| Are you sure you're okay?
Finn| Holy shram! Whoo!
Canyon| That was awesome, Finn. You know, you remind me of Billy when he was young.
Finn| Whoa. So... can I see you sometime?
Canyon| I have a feeling our paths will cross again. Take care, Finn.
Finn|"  ""Take Canyon on one last ride.""  Whoops.  What? Another item? You sneaky Billy. ""Lie on my back in the ocean. Just float."" Cool.  Why the ocean, Billy?!"
Finn| Okay, Finn, don't think about your fear. Just jump in there like it's no biggie. Do it for Billy. For Billy!
Finn| I'm afraid. I'm afraid! Oh, dang, here he comes! Here comes the Fear Feaster!
Fear Feaster| Way to go, Finn the Coward. Still afraid of the ocean, eh?  You should just give up! You're not a hero. You're a wimp-o! A cringing, cowardly—
Fear Feaster| Hey, where you going? Fool, I come with. Ha-ha! I'm gonna nosh on your insecurities. Then I'll—I'll squat on your hopes. So now what, little boy?
Fear Feaster| Huh? Uh, hey, man, don't do anything stupid. Hey! You're too chicken to face your fears with open eyes? This stank is cheating!
Finn| This stank is for Billy. 
Fear Feaster| No! 
Finn| Huh?  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
Finn| For Billy!
Fear Feaster| Wake up. Wake up!
Finn| Huh? Whoa!
Fear Feaster|  No mortal blade can harm—
Fear Feaster| What?! 
Finn| Was that you or me? Huh? Hey. Hey! I—I'm doing it!  I'm not afraid of the ocean anymore! I'm doing it, Billy.
Billy| Billy!
Billy| You finished my list. Now I can rest like a great hero. Thank you, Finn.
Finn| You're welcome. Canyon helped, too.
Billy| Tell Canyon I watch her sleep. Man, love is weird, Finn.
Finn| I know. Is that the thing you wanted to tell me?
Billy| No. Goodbye.
Finn| Wait. Billy!
Billy| What?
Finn| What's the thing you wanted to tell me?
Billy| Oh, uh, you must go to the Citadel. That's where your father is.
Finn| Joshua's not alive. Me and Jake buried him behind the—
Billy| Not Joshua! Your other dad. Dad the Human.
Finn| What?
Billy| Your father, Finn. He's alive.
Finn|  Huh. Is this, like, eating for you?
Flame Princess|  I don't know about eating, but it feels nice.
Finn|  Hmm. 
Ice King|  Hey!  You two should get a room! You and that log! Not you and Finn. 'Cause you're huggin' a log, you weirdo! 
Flame Princess|  Finn.
Finn|  Huh?
Flame Princess|  Let me. 
Ice King|   Hey now, stay away from me! Shoo shoo! 
Ice King|  Oh, so you wanna get real, do ya? Well, check this! You seeing this? 
Finn|   Whoa.
Flame Princess|   Why don't you get a room?! 
Ice King|  Ow! My hams!
Flame Princess|  Beat it, you freaky old trump! 
Finn|   Huh? What's cookin'? Smells good.
Finn|   My body is engulfed in flames!  Oh, so good!
Finn|  Jake! Jake! I had an awesome dream! Flame Princess was there; My body was on fire. I think it was inspired by Flame Princess battling Ice King yesterday!
Jake|  That's weird. I had a dream too. I'll tell you about it!
Jake|"  So then paintings were found and everybody's eyes lit up. Cinnamon Bun smiled and said ""I saw it from miles away""..."
Finn|   Man, I need to have that dream again. I have to get Flame Princess to beat down Ice King again.
Flame Princess|  Why'd you pick this spot?
Finn|  Why does anyone do anything?
Flame Princess|  Hmm...why do they?
Finn|   Mmm?
Flame Princess|  No thanks.
Finn|   Suit yourself!
Ice King|  
Finn|   Hey, look!  Hey, look! There's that big jerk you hate so much, remember?
Ice King|   Oh, hey, kids! Fine day for a picnic.
Finn|   Oh, dang. Did you hear that?! I think he's, like, making fun of you.
Flame Princess|  What?!
Finn|  Yeah, it's in the tone of his voice.
Flame Princess|   What did you say to me?
Ice King|  Uh, what? What did I say?
Flame Princess|   It is in the tone of your voice.
Ice King|  Look, just take whatever you want. Okay? Take it all!  It's all just prunes! Prunes and liver! Frozen, of course.
Ice King|   Ah. You might have what it takes to slap these old jowls, but do you have what it takes to face my- just a second...  Legion of Snow Warriors?! Go, fight! Protect me!  Oh, boy.
Flame Princess|  I don't like being made fun of, Ice King. I don't like it at all! 
Ice King|  Woah! 
Ice King|  Oh, man. Times! I call time! 
Flame Princess|  It's only okay if the person making the fun is someone I'm cool with! 
Ice King|  We're totes cool! I-I'm Ice King!
Flame Princess|   And they do it in a respectful and knowing way!
Ice King|  Respect? I got all kinds of respect!
Flame Princess|  Oh, yeah? Then what's with that stupid smirking face?
Ice King|   Smirk? I smirk when I'm nervous.
Snow Monster|  Bear hug! 
Ice King|  And also when I'm about to win!  Booyah!  And I didn't even get to test out my new fire-proof grundies!
Finn|  Put it away, man! You didn't win nothing!
Finn|   Are you okay? You feel... lukewarm.
Flame Princess|  I-I just need to burn a couple of forests or something. And get a good night's sleep.
Finn|  Yeah. Sleep.
Finn|   Milk.  Milk.  Play the sleep jam, BMO.
BMO|  
Finn|  Mmm. What's cookin'? Smells good. Wha?!  What?! Oh, no!
Finn|   Jake! I had another dream. My body was being blasted. But this time, Ice King was blasting me with ice cubes! Aww. It was awful! And someone else was there. He was just laughing and laughing. He was in the first dream too, but he was whispering. I couldn't make out what he was saying. Oh, yeah!  It was the Cosmic Owl!
Jake|   What?! You didn't tell me the Cosmic Owl was there!
Finn|  I couldn't see him last time!
Jake|  Dude, that means it was a prophetic dream! You have to finish the original dream! Cosmic Owl could be whispering something wildly significant! You have to get Flame Princess and Ice King to fight again so you can see the end of the dream! Make 'em fight!
Finn|   Dear Ice King, you smell like stink, you're unpleasant, you're not funny, you're old, blah blah blah, sincerely, the Flame Princess. P.S., let us fight.  Dear Flame Princess, you're just the worst, your hair is bad, your feet smell like face cheeks, blah blah blah, let's meet up and fight, dummy, sincerely, Ice King.  Flame Princess fight Ice King.
Finn|  Ice King!
Ice King|  What?
Ice King|  Ooh, beard mail!  Dear Ice King, you're not funny, you're old, and no princess will ever marry you ever, simple Simon.  Oh, fight.
Finn|  Flame Princess! 
Flame Princess|  Huh?  Dear Flame Princess, your feet smell like face cheeks, your stupid candles smell heinous, and you can't even kiss Finn without totes freakin' out! 
Ice King|  Not my beard! 
Princess Bubblegum|  What is all that noise?  Ach, mein Glöb!
Flame Princess|  Inferno...shot! 
Ice King|  Ice...the King! 
Flame Princess|  Stop that!
Ice King|   How's about some of this? 
Ice King|   Oh beans, oh beans, oh beans!
Finn|  I maybe went too far with this jazz.  Flame Princess! Oh, too hot. 
Finn|  Oh!  Huh?  Uh...
Cosmic Owl|  You blew it.
Finn|   Huh? 
Finn|  Okay, I can fix this. I can make it right.
Finn|  Ice King!
Ice King|   Finn!
Finn|  I'm so sorry, man.
Ice King|   Help Gunter. Please!  I meant after you saved me.
Finn|  Oh.  C'mon. Let's get out of here. 
Ice King|  Oh! That's right, carry me like a princess.
Flame Princess|  Ice King! You can't escape me! 
Finn|   Huh?
Flame Princess|   Finn!
Ice King|   Ice.  Whatever.
Flame Princess|   I'm so, so sorry, Finn! Are you alright?
Finn|  No, princess. I'm the one who's sorry.  Ice King hasn't been picking fights with you, it's...it's been me all along.
Ice King|   What?
Flame Princess|  So, you wrote that letter?
Finn|  Yes, but look, it's just like, I had this dream and it was because of that fight you had. It was weird, but I also liked it. But it was important because the Cosmic Owl was  So I had to get you to beat up Ice King-
Flame Princess|  Shh. I should have known. That letter said things in it that only you would know. Personal things, Finn. And you used them against me. I thought you were the one person I could- I need some time alone.
Finn|  Princess!
Finn|  But, I said I was sorry.
Ice King|  You blew it, man.
Jake| What'cha think?
Finn| I can make that driz, no problem.
Jake| It's crazy far, man.
Finn| Naw, that's just a perspectal illusion. It looks far 'cause the cliff's lower.
Jake| Eh, go for it.
Finn| Whoo! Shoot!
Finn| Almost.
Jake| Not really.
Finn| What? Watch me, fool!  Hup. WAAAAAAH!
Finn| I did it! Psych.  Hey, you know what? This is cool, just having bro time for once.
Jake| What, like, no ladies?
Finn| Or dudes, or whatevs. It's just a chore sometimes.
Jake| Yeah, two people is mad efficient.
Finn| Whoa.
Jake| It's a beach brawl!
Finn| Looks like they're trying to drown a barn.
Jake| That's not a barn. That's a dude!
Finn| Holy fizzle!  What's goin' on here, tough boy?  What is that huge dude?
Marauder| He's the Farm, the legendary fighter of the Shiney Isles. I came here to participate in his open challenge, but this mother can't be beat!
The Farm| Give up, worms! My fight power is supreme!  I'm too freaking legendary for you! 
Marauders|   Train, Train, Train, Train!
Finn| Whoa!
Marauder #1| I love you, the Train!
Marauder #2| You're almost as legendary as the Farm, the Train!
The Train| The Train is gonna smack you down on his tracks! Whoop!  Your caboose is mine!  Choo-choo. Choo-choo!
Finn| Oh, my Glob.
The Train|  Choooo!
The Train| Ow. My legs are backwards! Oh!  Oh, you're mean! 
Finn| Did you just die?
The Train| No... the Train will chug on. My friend makes bionic legs. I'll be better than before.
Finn|  I want bionic legs! Who's your friend?
The Train| Yeah, right. It's secret!  Ah! Don't follow me.  Oh! The Train can do this. 
Jake| You don't want bionic legs. It ain't natchy.
Finn| I don't care about natchy.
Jake| Let's discuss this later.
The Farm| You guys wanna fight me?
Finn|  You think we can beat him?
Jake| Yeah way, we can't! He's the ultimate!
Finn| But if we beat him, we'll be crazy legends.
Jake| Man, I already am a legend in other aspects of life. Third highest score in Kompy's Kastle, bro.  Third... in the Candy Kingdom.
Finn| Jake, that's your legend. This could be our legend. Brogend!
Jake| Okay. How are we gonna beat him, then?
Finn| Train!
Jake| He can't even walk.
Finn| No, man, train up, like, get ripped!
Jake| Yeah, I was just kiddin'. Let's destroy that guy! 
Finn| We're comin' back for you, the Farm! After we train!
The Farm|  Yeah, that's cool.
Finn| We're gonna annihilate you, the Farm!
The Farm| Mm'kay.
Finn| I'm gonna do a finishing move on you! Alright! Yeah!   C'mon, Jake!
Jake|  Whoof. 
Finn| Hyah! Hyah!
Jake| Let's see your Chokey Brokey Style!
Jake|  Nice one.
Finn| Yes!
Jake| Now watch my... Something Style. 
Finn| Huh?
Finn| Jake, you're playing Kompy's Kastle?
Jake| Huh? Whoo! Uh... yes.
Finn| Winning this battle could take our reputation to a whole new level!
Jake| Look, I'm a full-grown dog of my own, and I need to play Kompy's Kastle every day so I can maintain my rank.
Finn| So, you don't care about fighting the Farm?
Jake| I never really take anything seriously... 'cept Kompy's Kastle.
Finn| Hi-yah! 
Jake| KOMPYYYYY!
Jake| I'm gonna break every bone in your body, then heal you later with that magical goo we got from the Cyclops' eye!  AAAH! 
Finn| Ouch.
Jake|   Apologize!
Finn|  Never! 
Jake| I'm gonna turn up the juice!
Finn|  And I'm gonna drink it! 
Jake|  My little face!
Jake| Ouch!  Ow.  Oh!  Where are ya? Huh?
Jake| Huh? 
Finn| Apologize for not taking training seriously!
Jake| Come out, you chicken nug! 
Finn|  Huh!
Jake| Ow.
Jake| Apologize to Kompy's Kastle!
Finn|  No. You apologize for not taking training seriously.
Jake| Ehh, gross!
Jake| Ow! 
Jake| AAH! My eyes!  Cheap move, you butt rag!
Finn| You! You're the cheap move!
Finn| Huh? Pants!  Huh!
Jake| Oh!
Finn| I'm really gonna wipe you now.
Jake|  Bring it on, bro! 
Jake| OUCH! Ow! O-o-o-ow! No bities!  Grrrrr! 
Finn|  I'm gonna down the Farm without you.
Jake| I'm gonna knock down the Farm just so you'll never know the taste of downing the Farm!
Finn| Yo, guess what? Guess what, homey? I put in the time. I'ma make you mine.
Finn| Yeah, that's right. Come and get this.
The Farm|   So, what? Both at the same time? I'm cool. You gonna fight this, the Farm?  Okay.
Finn| Just me. I don't need this  clown-town.
Jake| The only way you're gonna win is if you use your cheap moves.
Jake| Hey.  Come on! You gotta fight the dude!
Finn| Ah! I can't see! Walk me to the light!
Jake| Yeah, that's what you get.
Finn|  Cloud looks like a car. 
Dream Warrior| Awaken to your dream, Finn and Jake.
Finn| Whoa. Who are you?
Dream Warrior| I am the Dream Warrior. I've summoned you to hang with me in your together dream.
Finn| Are you gonna show us a move to beat the Farm?
Dream Warrior| First, listen. Then, wake up.
Finn| Alright.
Dream Warrior| I have cheap cars. My cars are che-e-eap.
Finn & Jake|  My cars are cheap.
Dream Warrior| But they drive bad when I turn out the lights! 
Finn & Jake| Turn out the lights.
Dream Warrior|  These sweatpants have another name.
Finn & Jake| Another name.
Finn|" Yeah. Don't you always call sweatpants ""give-up-on-life pants,"" Jake?"
Jake| I do, because peeps need to respect themselves when they leave the house... even if it's just for ice cream, or TP, or whatev.
Dream Warrior|  Two shiny golden apples, ripe enough to bite.
Finn & Jake| Bite.
Dream Warrior|  That's all I gotta say for now. Get lost.
Jake| What is going on here, Dream Warrior?
Finn| Yeah, what's this all about?
Dream Warrior|  Nap's over, sorry.
Finn & Jake| Ow!
Finn| Whoa. That... was a good nap.
Jake| Hey, did you dream about Dream Warrior?
Finn| Yeah. What was he trying to tell us, exactly?
Jake| I don't know; I didn't get it. But listen, man. I'm sorry I got mad at you. Who cares about my high score at Kompy? It ain't important.
Finn| No, man. It is important. Being the third best at something is math and deserves respect. Not like I did to Kompy. Anyway, I think we both got cranky after all that training.
Jake| Well, good thing we're rested, 'cause now we can beat this beast.
Finn| Yeah. Oh, hey! Look!
Jake| Dudes came back to watch us fight!
Finn| A'ight. This is it. Let's use what we learned in training.
Jake| Uh, all we did was fight dirty with cheap—wait.
Dream Warrior| My cars are che-e—che-e-eap
Jake| Dream Warrior was telling us what cheap moves to use on the Farm! Headlights mean eyes!
Finn| Mud in the eyes!
Jake| Give-up-on-life pants!
Finn|  Pull down his pants like you did to moi!
Jake| Two golden apples!
Finn| Hm. I think I know what that means.
Jake| Well, sure. I can make a wild guess.
Finn| You ready, man?
Jake| Yeah, dude!
Jake|  Put your pants on.
Finn|  Okay.
Marceline| Knock, knock. Yo, Peebs, you want to make a midnight Squeez-E-Mart run? I'm gonna drink the red from out the customers' bloodshot eyes.  Psych. I'll probably just get a slushie.
Marceline| Bubblegum? Bonnibel! 
King of Ooo| Wha—?
Marceline| Ugh! What are you doing here?!
King of Ooo|  Be not afraid, child. It is I, the one true princess of Ooo!
Marceline| Where's Bubblegum?! 
King of Ooo|  Whoa! Relax!  Bubblegum is fine, just fine... and deposed! And powerless! So crushed by defeat was she that the tyrant exiled herself to a sad cabin on the shores of Lake Butterscotch—technically still Candy Kingdom territory. But in my mercy, I've allowed her to remain.
Marceline| You're the princess?! Since when?
King of Ooo| Well, by the reckoning of my new Torontian calendar, Ooo's official calendar, uh, two glorious months.
Marceline| Two months? But—then why didn't she t— Bubblegum! 
King of Ooo| Tell Bubblegum I wear her nightgown! Tell everyone!
Marceline|  BONNIE!
Princess Bubblegum| Marceline. What up?
Marceline| Ugh. Why didn't you tell me you got throne-jacked! I gotta hear it from that wax fraud!
Peppermint Butler|  Be cool, Marceline. Let's all be real cool.
Princess Bubblegum| Give us a minute, Peppermint Butler.
Peppermint Butler| Hmm.  Hup hup hup hup...
Marceline| Well?
Princess Bubblegum| I didn't get jacked. I quit. But yeah, alright, I should have told you. I was just  embarrassed. And it all happened so fast. I'm still trying to sort things out, see things rationally.
Marceline| Huh. Well, you could have talked to me about it.
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeah, 'cause you're so dang rational. Ha ha. I'm sorry, that's mean. I'm trying to be less mean. That's why I'm starting fresh with a new kingdom out here. Just me, Pep But, some pretty stars. Ugh, and of course, some varmints.
Marceline| Varmints?
Princess Bubblegum| Varmints!  Raiding my pumpkin patch. Every dang night!  After all my sweet bio-engineering? The nerve of these varmints. Not tonight! 
Marceline|  So, how long you gonna sit out here for?
Princess Bubblegum| Long as it takes. 
Marceline| Uh, alright, yeah! Let's get these varmints.
Princess Bubblegum| Um...yeah.
Marceline|  These must be pretty good pumpkins, huh?
Princess Bubblegum| They're citizens of my garden kingdom. 100% loyal garden citizens.
Marceline|  That reminds me -- so I was in the grocery kingdom last Sunday, 'cause free samples, you know. They had these, like, shrimp cocktail dealies. So good. I was sucking the sauce off them and hucking the shrimp at the ceiling. I kept going back for more and more samples, I could not stop myself. I don't know, man. The shrimp must have gone bad or something, 'cause all that red came right back up. Still invisible and yakking red all down the produce isle. It was awesome.
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey, you remember that one time --
Princess Bubblegum|   Hey!
Princess Bubblegum| Varmints! After them!  Varmint hole! Ah, nuh-unh! A ding dang varmint hole. I can't believe my sweeps didn't find it.
Marceline| Well you found it now. So, what next?
Princess Bubblegum|  Next? We dig.
Princess Bubblegum| Hmm. This looks like a delivery tunnel from the old rock-candy mines.
Marceline| Huh! We haven't been down here in hundreds of years. Remember when I'd get you out of those stinky Cheese Kingdom trade meetings and we'd sneak down here and spray-paint the walls?
Princess Bubblegum| Um, I am pretty sure it was me who found you vandalizing my property.
Marceline|  Yeah, but I got you to tag something, didn't I? I bet I could find it. Here, come on. We used to follow the mine car rails, cracking jokes, telling stories... Whoa! The broken bridge! Remember? You jumped across this! You were so scared.
Princess Bubblegum| Mmm, I think I was just trying to prove something.
Marceline| Bonnibel Bubblegum, always so prepared.
Princess Bubblegum|" Yeah, I have to be ""always so prepared."" We can't all just ""wing it."" I didn't have to always worry about so many things, you know? The Candy Kingdom used to be so small, so manageable. But then it kept growing and growing, and there was always some new disaster to prepare against."
Marceline| Is that why you stopped talking to me?
Princess Bubblegum| No, I...
Princess Bubblegum| Bring it, ya darn pumpkin munchers!
Marceline| It's a freaking mother varmint!
Princess Bubblegum| Ugh! Marcy, cover me!
Marceline| No problem.
Princess Bubblegum| Marceline! Look out!
Marceline| Huh?
Princess Bubblegum| She's going to bring the whole tunnel down!
Princess Bubblegum| My snapback!
Marceline| In there!
Marceline| You got any more gadgets?
Princess Bubblegum| Umm... Some bandages, a pen, unpaid internet bill, and a strawberry lip balm.
Marceline|  Ah.
Princess Bubblegum| Maybe we can find something useful around... Oh!
Marceline| Your tag! We actually found it. Man, your handwriting hasn't changed at all.  Still as prissy and prim as... What?
Marceline| Hey, hey, whoa. Wait, I didn't mean... I like your handwriting. I think it's realy pretty.
Princess Bubblegum| It's... it's not that... I lost my hat.
Marceline| We can get you another hat.
Princess Bubblegum| I lost my hat, lost my home, lost my people. I can't even keep darn varmints out of my pumpkin patch!
Marceline| Oh, Bonnie, you're...
Princess Bubblegum| I tried. I really, really tried. I just... I thought that if I shut everything out and just focused on work, it would all be okay, but look where that landed me. All I managed to do was push everyone away. I pushed you away. I'm sorry, Marceline. I've been a real dinger to you.
Marceline| Come on. What are you even apologizing for?
Marceline| Uh, how about we not get buried under a metric ton of rock-candy rubble?
Princess Bubblegum| The field generator! Aw, geez! Okay, uh, maybe I can rig up a graffiti bomb or a rudimentary rock-candy cannon or... what?
Marceline| This time, I'm prepared. I've been watching these dudes pretty close. I think I can varmint-style dig us through the wall. It's just a shame about your tag, I don't want to mess it up.
Princess Bubblegum| Nah, it's good, I think. Mess it up.
Marceline| Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig!
Princess Bubblegum| Yo, varmints! You hungry? I'll eat you! I'll eat your mom! I'll eat your eggs! I'll... Whoop!
Marceline| Thanks.  Boing!
Princess Bubblegum| I'm crazy tired, Marceline. I think I have been for a long time.  But those varmints are still out there, waiting.
Marceline| Eh, worry about it tomorrow. I'll keep a lookout tonight. I'll watch the heck out of this pumpkin patch. Come on.
Princess Bubblegum|   Well, okay. Maybe for a bit. Don't let me sleep too long. Promise to wake me up in 15 minutes.
Marceline| I promise.
Peppermint Butler| Uh, can I come back now?
Finn|  Safety!  Patrol!
Jake|  Safety!  Patrol! Safety patrol! Safety— Oh... Were we not wearing the uniforms?
Finn|  C'mon. Let's keep lookin' for hazards. Look out!
Jake|  What is it, dude?
Finn|  Shushers, man!  Look there!
Jake|  Just looks like an ordinary little town, man.
Finn|  Yeah...  Suspiciously ordinary. Oh! Little house people! Maybe it is just regular ordinary, not sinister ordinary—oh, no, wait... Grass ogre.
Donny|  Haha!  Hey, chicken, you're travelin' egg-spress! 
Finn|  It's an obnoxious grass ogre.
Donny|  You get my joke, right?! Hahaha!
Barn House|  Careful, you oaf! Those chickens are rentals!  Agh!
Donny|   We're havin' so much fun, huh?!
Jail House|  Drop that chicken!
Donny|   Huh?
Jail House|  You're under arrest!  Good... Now get in your tiny cell... Oh, uh, oh!
Finn|  Hey, ogre! Stop hazing these cute little houses!
Jake|  Ya jerkball!
Donny|  My name is Donny, idiot!
Finn|  Sorry. I was just tryina' get your attention.
Donny|  What kinda houses are you supposed to be? A... stupid... uh... a dumb house?! Haha! Hey, what's with your jowl?! 
Jake|  Ow!
Donny|  Hahaha! I'm gonna mess with these housies some more.
Finn|  NEVER!!
Donny|  So you wanna wrestle, huh? 'Cause I know, like, this ninja move to get out of this lock instantly! Okay... Now, first I...  Hey! You're doin' it wrong!!
Jake|   Whoa.
Finn|  You're doin' it wrong!
Donny|  Whaddaya mean?
Finn|  First, you roll your right shoulder forward...
Donny|  Like this?
Finn|  Yeah, but then I counter it by doin' this! 
Donny|  Hey!
Finn|  Um... You need to take a break?
Donny|  No... but if you need to, we can stop...  Ya baby.
Jake|  Whoa, I zoned out there for a bit. Did you win?
Finn|  Nah. Just takin' five. Donny's pretty good.
Donny|  Yeah, well, you're okay, too.
Finn|  Thanks, man.
Donny|  ...For a complete idiot!
Finn|  Aww...
Jake|  Donald, quit all this jerky nonsense!  Unless you wanna get gored by a forest prince!
Donny|  I was just kiddin' around, but then you took it too far! You guys are the real jerks! 
Jake|  Donny is one mixed-up dude.
Finn|  Nah. He's just rough-and-tumble, like me, but deep down, he's probably really sensitive, like me.
Jake|  You're a mixed-up dude, too!
Finn|  Hey, Donny!
Donny|  What?
Finn|  I was thinkin' that since you're a pretty good wrestler, maybe you'd wanna hang out with a couple a' rascals like me and Jake!
Jake|  What?
Donny|  Muuuh... I don't know. Messin' with these housies is pretty fun. You got somethin' better?
Jake|   You sure this is a good idea?
Finn|   If you come to the Tree Fort, we got video games and apple juice!
Donny|   Really?!  I mean... if it keeps you from cryin'...
Finn|   Donny's problem is that he's treated like an outsider, like me.
Jake|  You are not an outsider. You wear cute little blue shorts!
Finn|  I... am complicated.
Donny|  Uh... This fort isn't so great. Not as cool as the fort I'm gonna build.  I call this chair!
Finn|  Hey, Donny, you should play Bug Battle.
Jake|   And hey, can you put on some pants?!
Donny|  You put on some pants!
Jake|  I have pants...  spun from spiderwebs... by pixies.
Finn|   Okay. There's you, and here come the bugs.
Donny|  Huh?!
Finn|  Oh, yeah. Those guys'll get ya.
Donny|   Urgh!! This game cheats! 
Jake|  Not cool, dude.
Finn|  Have more apple juice. It always makes me feel better when I—  Aaah! Donny! Quit being a jerk!
Donny|  What? What'd I do?
Jake|  Finn, I don't think this is gonna work.
BMO|  I am incapable of all emotion.... but you are making me chafed!!
Donny|  Everybody's gettin' mad at me for nothin'!
Finn|  You have to think about how your actions make other people feel.
Donny|  Ohh. Hmm. I don't understand at all.
Jake|  Ooh! Teach him that little empathy song I taught you!
Finn|  Okay, yeah!  Empathy, empathy, put yourself in the place of me!  Your turn!
Donny|  Uh... Empathy, empathy, put yourself... Ohh! So it's like, when I squeeze eggs outta chickens, I should let them squeeze eggs outta me, too!
Finn|  ...Um... kinda right.  Someone needs our help! Jake, you stay here and try to fix him, while I deal with an unknown possibly deadly emergency! 
Jake|  Dude, trade me jobs.
Donny|  Jake! Someone broke your... um... entire living room!
Bank House|  Quick! Act abandoned!
Finn|  Hands off the housing market!  BACKPACK!  Werewolves. Much worse than ogres. 
Jail House|  Stop in the name of the law!
Finn|  Is there somewhere I can trap that thing?
Jail House|  Well, there was a zoo, but he moved back east. Course, there's always the old well.
Well|  I'm not old!
Finn|  Perfect!  Slam-bam-in-a-can! Huh? Another werewolf?!? What's up with this town?!
Finn|  Mr. Bank! Are you alright?!
Bank House|  Oh, it's fine, it's fine. All my assets are insured. Pardon.  I have to go spackle my cracks.
Finn|   Why is this town just getting worse and worse?
Wolf|   Yes! Why indeed!!
Finn|   Hey! What are you werewolves up to?!
Wolf|  We're not werewolves...   We're Why-wolves.
Finn|  Uh... Why-wolves?
Why-wolf|  Creatures possessed by the spirit of inquiry.....  AND... BLOODLUST!!
Finn|  What?!
Why-wolf|   Please. Save your questions until the end of the lecture.  Our ecosystem. At the bottom level are the house people. Given the opportunity, we Why-wolves would easily wipe them out. However, Donny's presence is a natural deterrent. His jerkiness is so powerful that it produces a pungent gas—obnoxygen. To Why-wolves, it is a deadly poison. But since you've removed the jerk Donny, we will devour the houses, and our population will rapidly swell until we are, in turn, devoured by the Cosmic Owl. Such is the course of nature, but it'll be a pretty sweet ride up until that point.  TONIGHT, WE FEAST ON THE BLOOD OF THE INNOCENTS! 
Finn|  Oh, no! I have to get Donny back!
Finn|   Donny, you have to go right now, and stop the Why-wolves from—
Donny|   Ah! Master Finn has returned!
Finn|  What's it goin'?!
Donny|  Thanks to you, I shall never be jerky again!
Finn|  Oh, no... Oh, no. Oh, no, nonononononono! No! This is all wrong! We need jerk Donny to make the obnoxygen, and, and—
Donny|"  Steady on, Finn. Perhaps you are dehydrated! It's as Jake taught me  ""8 ounces, 8 glasses, 8 days a week!""  I'll fetch you some tap water."
Finn|  Are you wearing jeans now?!
Donny|  Surely!  Gotta get pants! Go get your pants! Button, fly! I wrote that one myself. Perdoname. 
Finn|  But, but, but—
Jake|  Butt, butt, butt! Yeah, Donny! You're lookin' good in those jeans!
Finn|  What did you do?!
Jake|  Miraculous, isn't it? I just kept teachin' him my musical rules, and now, he's perfect.
Finn|  No! We messed up, Jake! The House People are doomed if Donny doesn't go back to being town jerk!
Donny|   I have no intention of being a jerk again. Hmph.
Finn|  But the housies will be wiped out if you don't!
Donny|  It sounds tragic, but I'm turning over a new leaf! 
Finn|  Donny, you gotta go!
Donny|"  Finn, ""no"" means, ""no."" I'm sure you'll respect my wishes.  No! Stop! No!"
Finn|  Now, go be a jerk to those Why-wolves!
Donny|  No! I'll use my musical messages to stop them!  Let's see... I've got one on the ethics of laundry... Crosswalk-ery... Ooh! Here's a good one!
Finn|  Man! The town is getting creamed! By not being a jerk, you're being a real jerk, Donny!!
Donny|   Comb your hair right! It's a good time! Sticky, sticky pomades, short back and sides!   Why isn't anybody paying attention to my words?
Finn|   He sure is sensitive about his songs!   It's cuz they think your songs are dumb!
Donny|  Wha?!
Jake|   What're you saying?! If you don't encourage his talent, he might revert back to jerk Do—  OHHH, OHHH!  HEY, DONNY! EVERYONE SAYS YOUR SONGS ARE SUPER BALLS!!
Finn|  They all think you're a real jerk!
Donny|  But... but I've changed! Why would they say that?!  Empathy, empathy, put your mind insi...
Why-wolf|  You're so pathetic! So comical!
Donny|   Rrrrr... Think I'm a jerk do they? I'm feelin'.. obnoxious!!  HEY, YOU WHY-WOLVES ARE COOL! JUST KIDDING!  HAHAHAHA!!
Why-wolf|  Obnoxygen cloud!! EGRESS!!
House People|  The town is saved!!
Donny|  Get offa' me, nerds!!
Finn|  You did it, Donny! You're a full-blown jerk again!
Donny|  What?! You're the jerk!! Housies! Ready to hear my new song?! It's about how Finn will betray you, just to save lives!
Finn|   I'm sorry, Donny.
Donny|  I'll never forgive you, Finn!!  WAAAAAAH!!!
Jake|   C'mon. We can go stare wistfully at the lake.
Finn|   I'd... I'd like that. Very much.
Donny|  Hey! I love bein' a jerk! Thanks, Finn! Finn?  Finn, you loser!  I'll never... forget you!
Shermy| Haha, you're doing it wrong. Like this. 
Beth|  Shermy, this is silly as heck. Beatboxing is for babies.
Shermy|  No, it's not. I am a man.
Beth| I don't know about that, but you should start thinking about your future.
Shermy| What about you, Princess Zip? What are your goals?
Shermy| Ha! Princess Zip's got a one-track mind!
Shermy| Prize Ball Guardian's back!
Shermy| Let's get 'em!
Shermy| Get that boulder!
Shermy| Hup! Whap!
Shermy| Ha! Here it comes!
Shermy|  Boy! My knots suck!
Shermy| Yeah, I see you.
Beth| Hey, Sherm, you see this?
Shermy| Nope.
Beth| It looks like the Guardian scuffed something up.
Shermy| Ohhh!  Whoa!
Beth| It's beautiful! Let's take it home, and I'll learn about it with my brain.
Shermy| You and your brain!
Shermy|"  ♪ ""On a tropical island, on a tropical island..."" ♪"
Shermy| It looks so old, Beth! Whose do you think it is... or was?
Beth| There's no markings on it or anything. I think we should find the King of Ooo and ask him.
Shermy| What? Beth, the King of Ooo is just a myth... Come on, Beth!
Beth| That's what I thought, too, but I was doing some research at the library–
Shermy| Nooooo! Not the library! You can't make me!
Beth| Shermy, I have the book here. Already checked it out.
Shermy| Oh.
Beth| He's supposed to have lived in a cave at the top of Mount Cragdor.
Shermy| Really?
Beth| Uh-huh... He's supposed to have lived forever.
Shermy| Come on, Beth! Come on, come on, come on!
Shermy| Come on, Beth! Come on, come on, come on!
Shermy| I did it. I found him! The King of Ooo.
BMO| Welcome, friends, I've been expecting you. Because of my proximity radar. Hehehe... Come on inside.
Shermy| Wow! King of Ooo, you must be rich!
BMO| Yeah, that's me alright.
BMO| I'm sure you are very thirsty after your journ...
Shermy| Whoops...
Shermy| This place is wild.  Huh? This is crazy!
BMO| Please be careful with...
Beth| Sorry, sir... My big feet.
Shermy| Hey, Beth, look. I'm a princess, too 
Beth| Shermy...
Shermy| I-I think it's okay... 
Beth| Be careful... This stuff isn't ours. Woops. Oh... 
BMO| Well, goodbye!
Beth| Oh, no, no...
BMO| Have fun on the other side of this door.
Beth| But... We came here to ask about something.
BMO| No, don't worry about it. Please leav... 
Beth|  Do you recognize it?
BMO| Yeah... It belonged to my best friend. Fred!
Shermy| Fred!
BMO| No... Not Fred... His name was, Phil! He was an amazing hero, and he was there at the end.
BMO| Do you know about The Great Gumwar?
Shermy| Mnm-mnm.
BMO| Well, get ready to have your hair blown back!
Finn| Hey, there it is again! It's close.
Jake| Let me see!
Finn|  It looks like Normal Man, Betty, and...  Maja?
Jake|  Come on!
Finn| Hey, just-
Jake| Let me-  Maja's got smoke coming off her.
Finn| You think they're with the Gumbaldians?
Jake| I don't know, but they're flippin' freakin' me out.  Guess we better tell PB, huh?
Finn|  Yeah, I guess.
Jake| Hey man, don't even worry about all this war stuff. I know we'll find a way to fix this thing. Come on! You'll see. 
BMO| And so the Princess was mother to her own uncle, and that made him mad. But she had friends, and he had friends, so they decided to have a bad fight - the biggest fight that Ooo had ever seen.
Princess Bubblegum|" Then it's settled. At the stroke of high noon, when the sun is at its most zenith-est, Banana Battalions three and four will initiate operation ""Shut the Door"", forming a pincer formation around Gumbald's exposed nether legions, isolating his rear and -"
Duke of Nuts| Um, excuse me? Excuse me. Princess, if I may. I think I have a plan that'll put an end to all this tonight. I just need a Bowie knife, a snowmobile, a parachute,  rubber gloves, and, uh... 
Lemongrab|  Terrible, mm! Terrible plan!... Mm! No!
Duke of Nuts| But, but my -
Lemongrab| My plan! Hot air balloon!
Princess Bubblegum| Hey! Now's not the time. Unless we win this fight today, we all get to take a nice Pep-Butt-style sponge bath in Uncle Gumbald's extra-strength lobotomy sauce, understand? 
Lemongrab| No.
Duke of Nuts| Not really.
Princess Bubblegum| Well I do, so we're doing this my way. Now-
Finn| Um, PB?
Princess Bubblegum| Finn, you're back. How goes the scouting?
Finn| Um-
Jake| We saw Normal Man and Betty flying around with Maja, and they were chanting.
Princess Bubblegum| Hmm, very peculiar.
Finn| Hey, maybe this is, like, a bad omen. Like, to see the King of Mars, um, up among the stars? It's like a bad omen, and you should call off the battle. I think I heard that somewhere...
Camera| Low battery. Please connect to power...
Cake Person|  Long live Gumbaldia!
Princess Bubblegum| Stonk! That dang Gumbald just peeped all my tactics!  He's left me no choice. The attack begins now.
Princess Bubblegum| Stonk! That dang Gumbald just peeped all my tactics! 
Gumbald| Well, that settles it then. If we know, and she knows, and we know she knows we know - which we do - then we know we have no choice. We must strike now. Ladies and gentlemen, to war!
Marceline| A word?
Princess Bubblegum| All right, just make it quick. ...Please.
Marceline| Well, I know you're under a lot of pressure here, but I... I just wanna ask you to reconsider. I mean, I don't like to flaunt my suffering cred, but I've lived through something like this once before, and...  I'm just not really tryin' to help start that all up again.
Princess Bubblegum| I understand, Marceline, I really do. But I just can't see another way out of this. Look, I've gotta go.  Let's talk more when this is all over. Wish me luck, okay?
Marceline| Good luck!
Jake|  What if PB's right about this? Maybe she'll just go whup Gumbald's rear, and then things'll go back to normal.
Finn| Nah, man, she's wrong. This is all wrong. Even if she wins now, this is never gonna end; I can feel it. It's like the whole world's going crazy, man, like we're living in, one, big... 
Jake| Finn?
Finn| ... one big nightmare.
Lumpy Space Princess| Here we go.
Colonel Candy Corn|  War! War! War! War! War! War!
Princess Bubblegum| Banana Guard 500s, you're on!
Banana Guard 500|" Up we go.  In position, ma'am. Code name, ""Father's Brother"", appears testy."
Gumbald|  More bananas!? You're weird, Bubblegum!  You! Give me your lunch. Got a banana in here?  Is this a banana? Hey, niece!
Princess Bubblegum| Yes?  I'm doing it! I'm soundin' the war horn! 
Finn| Wait!
Princess Bubblegum| What!?  Dang it, Finn!
Finn| PB! He sees that you're serious! Maybe he'll back down now. Please listen to me! We've been friends for a long time. 
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, Finn. We'll give him one last chance.
Gumbald| What?  Come on.
Finn| Here they come!
Gumbald| Hurry this up. I want a war.
Finn| Hey, Fern.
Princess Bubblegum| Uncle Gumbald, I demand that you de-escalate your forces now.
Gumbald|  Listen to yourself. You're a toddler, Bonnibel.
Princess Bubblegum|  SURRENDER OR DIE!
Gumbald| No!
Jake| That's my cue!
Princess Bubblegum| What?
Jake| Hya-pow! 
Lumpy Space Princess|  They're dead! They're actually dead!
BMO| And so they were dead. ...No, not dead.
Princess Bubblegum| What is this place? Finn?
Finn| Last resort! Sorry, PB, but you were acting like total nuts out there. Now you guys have to hash this out in the unconscious world.
Gumbald| This is... a dream?
Jake| Yeah, man. You can basically do anything in dreams.
Gumbald| Sneak attack!  If we destroy them here, maybe they'll die in the real world.
Princess Bubblegum| Psst! Not if I destroy you first!
Finn| No! We need love, not war!
Princess Bubblegum| Good idea.  Love bazooka! Put down your weapons, or I'll bazooka you!
Gumbald| No!
Finn| Thank goodness for a singing pot beast to de-escalate the situation.
Jake| Oh, this sandwich is way too much for me. Jermaine always liked splitting sandwiches.
Jermaine|  Mmm! Thanks, bro.
Gumbald| I'm gonna figure out how to wake myself up and take my revenge on you sleeping chumps!
Fern| You're leaving me?
Gumbald| You're on your own, kid. 
Princess Bubblegum| He's rooting into the ground. Ready, aim...
Finn| No!  You're supposed to be having some kind of epiphany!
Princess Bubblegum|  Here's my epiphany you've gone rogue on me! I'm outtie five thou! 
Finn| Fern!  Come on! Snap out of it, man!  Aah!
Fern| I don't need your help. 
Finn| Jake? Help me!
Jake| I want to help you,  but I can't lose this job.
Jermaine|  Waiter! Oh, waiter!
Finn| Dude...
Fern| I'm going to fly around, and wreck things, until I feel better! Or until I tire myself out.
Finn| Peaceful thoughts...  Fern!
Jermaine| It all looks so good.  What's up with that bird? Why are you looking at me, bird?  Bad bird!
Jake|  Everybody gets an evil doppelganger but me.
Jermaine| I'll be your evil doppelganger!
Jake| Jermaine, you're the best! 
Princess Bubblegum| Enough, Gumbald! 
Gumbald|  Pinch me, I want to wake up!
Princess Bubblegum| Gumbald! We're ending this here.
Gumbald| So be it.
Finn| If you could just calm down and be cool, it would be a great thing that there's two of us.
Fern| Why don't you just fight me like a real butterfly!?
Finn| We're two sides of the same coin!
Fern| You'll never understand what it's like to be me. I'm TORMENTED!
Finn| I'm ALSO that sometimes!
Fern| Prove it, or I'll never stop fighting you.
Jermaine|  Oh geez, how's he gonna do that?
Jake| Hmm?  Finn, we'll be right back.
Finn| Okay- ah! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Come on, little gum. Don't run away from happiness! I'm gonna fix you!
Gumbald| No, no, no!
Princess Bubblegum| Just ONE drop. Drip a drop, I drip a drop. Not gonna stop, till I drip a drop.
Gumbald| Hmm? 
Princess Bubblegum|  Drip, drip!  The juice! NOOOO!...  ...Wuh-what?
Gumbald|  Call me... princess.
Jermaine| What are we looking for?
Jake| Mm, I can't quite picture it. But I'm pretty sure Finn buried it here.
Jermaine| ... In the underground balloon mall. Remember how much balloon animals used to cheer Finn up?
Jake| Yeah...
Lady Rainicorn| 그래. 
Jake|  Huh?
Jake| Uh, Lady, where's Jermaine?
Lady Rainicorn| 쉿.   이런 어두운 지하굴에서는 살살 걸어야 돼. 
Jake| Aww, sleepy puppies.
Jake| Yee! 
Jake| And I'm done!
Lady Rainicorn| 걱정하지 마, 제이크! 내가 처치할게! 
Jake| What? Oof! 
Charlie|  Your farts aren't funny, dad!
Jake| NOOOOOO!!!  Huh? Oh dang!  Is that... Finn's vault?  Aargh! Nightmare fart!
Candy Bonnibel|  It's beautiful...
Gumbald| No! Oh, why didn't I build an armature?
Candy Bonnibel|  I can help you, Princess! Just listen to this!  Watch me do my tiny taffy dance! 
Finn| Fern, come on! I'm not fighting you.
Finn & Fern| Oh, what reeks?
Jake| Repressed memories! 
Finn & Fern| My vault!?
Jake| Proof! 
Finn| See? this is our shared torment!
Fern| Dude, I blocked this stuff out for a reason!
Finn|  Well, now you know how I feel about knowing how you feel about!
Fern|  Okay, okay! Just make it stop!
Finn| We gotta confront them head on!
Finn| Fern. This is why I brought us here. We can defeat him together.
Princess Bubblegum's voice| No fear.
Finn| So you're the nasty grass wad that's been holding my Finn boy hostage.
Grass Demon| Without me, he's got no body. So back off. 
Finn| You sicken me.
Past Finn| I'm me again. It feels like it's been years.
Past Finn| He was right. I've got no body.
Jake| Ah, don't worry. It's just a dream!
Lumpy Space Princess|  They're dead! They're actually dead!  Never mind! They're okay!
Finn| Fern! You really are disintegrating!
Jake| My bad.
Gumbald| Bonnie, I...
Princess Bubblegum| I'm so sorry for what I put you through for all those centuries. The Candy Kingdom was your dream, and I took it from you.
Gumbald| Bonnie, that means so much to me. Come. From now on, we'll live in peace.  Drat.
Princess Bubblegum| WHAT?!
Lolly| He never was the epiphany type. But I am willing to let bygones be bygones.
Princess Bubblegum| Very well. Two Candy Kingdoms, it is!
People from Both Sides| Hurray!
BMO| And so, in the end, they decided not to have the big fight.
Beth| Oh! So you meant, like, the end of the war. I thought you meant like the end of the world.
BMO| No, no, no. That happened next.
Lumpy Space Princess| So I guess everyone's just going home, huh?
Jake| Yep.
King Man| We donked up for real. 
Finn| Jake... what am I lookin' at?
Jake| Uh... we saved the day. So, maybe that big baby's here to give us presents for doing a good job?
Fern| Okay, I'm not an expert, but this seems bad.
Flame Princess| You ain't kiddin', shrubs.
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh - no - ! 
Marceline| Bonnie! What did you do?!
Princess Bubblegum| It wasn't me!
Ice King|  It's been real cool being in this rogue's gallery with you. Me and Gunter were gonna go, uh...  Oh... my...  GOLB!
Simon Petrikov| Look, Betty. I keep seeing reference to this mysterious entity that embodies chaos.
Betty Grof| That's great! Come on, let's make sundaes.
Simon| GOLB would say ice cream is without meaning. Just empty calories devoid of purpose.
Betty| Good thing he isn't here then.
Simon|  His presence is felt in every crevice where chaos lurks. Imagine if we could somehow harness all that dank energy...!
Betty| Hey! You want some cherries with that chocolate syrup?
Simon|  Oh!  Sure.
Betty| Catch! 
Simon| Have you thought about using sliced almonds for the sundaes? 
Ice King|  ...I don't know who that is!
Lolly| Don't let it touch you!
Candy Person| No, I'm a loner!
Marceline| Peebs, this is the worst thing ever! If somebody doesn't stop this, it could be the end of Ooo!
Princess Bubblegum| You're right, Marceline. I gotta do something!  Banana guards!
Banana Guard| Uh, no.
Princess Bubblegum| Obey my command! Flee for your lives! If you fight, the demon will just add you to its mass!
Banana Guard| Can we flee in a panic?
Princess Bubblegum| Yes!
Finn| FYI, Princess, I'm not going anywhere!
Jake|  I'm also staying.
Princess Bubblegum| Thanks, guys.
Marceline| I'm in, too. This is a war I have to fight. We all have to.
Fern| Me too! I'll defend Ooo down to my last blade. 
Princess Bubblegum| Gumball guardians!
Gumball Guardians| Yes, mom?
Princess Bubblegum| Stop that monster!
Gumball Guardians| Okay.  Containing enemy!  Gross.
Lolly|  Cake, pick me up!  My friends! It is time to set aside past differences! We must join the fight!  Hmm! Forwards! 
Finn| Normal Man! Come on, wake up!
King Man|  Is that Ice King?
Finn| How do we stop these guys?  Come on, Jake.
Jake|  H-H-H-Horse!
Gumball Guardian #1| Ugh! My balance!
Jake| War is the worst, dude!
Gumball Guardian #1|  Sorry, mom... 
Princess Bubblegum| My guardian!
King Man| Ice King! Ice King!
Ice King| What's up?
Jake|  Ho-ho-ho.
Finn| How do I stop this!  What?
King Man| You are the only one who can stop this! Betty's up there, trying to harness the power of GOLB! We have to snap her out of that trance and banish GOLB, or we're all doomed! If anyone can do it, it's you.
Ice King| Sounds great! Im'a save the world! 
Gumball Guardian #2|  Enemy threat restrained.
Princess Bubblegum| They got him!
Gumball Guardian #2|  Awaiting orders.  Help me, mom. I'm turning nasty...
Banana Guards| Princess, we came back to help!  Eee! Help us, princess!
Princess Bubblegum| Ugh! 
Ice King| Evil penguins!
Jake| Don't worry, guys! 
Finn| Jake!
Jake| I believe in you, Ice King!  Aah! I didn't think this through!... 
Lumpy Space Princess| So this is it.  Oh tender lad! I give you the parting gift of my lips.
Lemongrab| I find your proposal...  ...ACCEPTABLE!
Lumpy Space Princess| You're welcome.
Finn| Betty! You have to stop this!
King Man| Go ahead. Talk to her, IK.
Ice King| Who?  Oh, it's weird lady! Hey, lady. ...I'm diggin' your primitive dance style!
King Man| No! You're supposed to stop her, not encourage her! You gotta dig deep inside and find those magical words to shake her outta that trance! Get personal and emotional!
Ice King| Personal? Emotional? Oh! Just like a fan-fic!
King Man| No!...
Ice King|" ""I feel like nothing was real until I met you. I feel like we connect. And I really get you. If I said 'You're a beautiful girl,  would it upset you? The way you look tonight, silhouetted, I'll never forget it."""
Betty| Simon...
Ice King|  ♪ Oh, oh,  Fionna!... Your fist has touched my heart... ♪
Betty| What... You're trying to stop me!?  When I'm this close to harnessing the most powerful force in the universe and finally saving you!?
Ice King| Yeah, I guess. ...Right, Finn?
Betty|  Emotional super-charge! 
Maja| Finally! My time - 
Ice King| Ice King!
Flame Princess|  Burn, burn, burn! PB, get me some backup! Ugh!  Ugh!
Princess Bubblegum| It's headed this way!
Fern| I'll take down this beast! Fern's way! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Fern!  No, no, no, no, no! NO!!! 
Marceline| Bonnie!
Cake Person| Thanks.
Princess Bubblegum| Marcy?...
Marceline|  You're okay!
Princess Bubblegum| My armor has an emergency - 
Marceline| You scared me.
Princess Bubblegum| What?
Marceline| Even back when we weren't talking, I was so afraid something bad would happen to you, and I wouldn't be there to protect you. And...  I don't want to lose you again.
Princess Bubblegum| Hey, I'm a tough gum. Nothing never happening to me, never.
Marceline| I know, I... Girl, you phrased that so weird.
Princess Bubblegum| I might have a concussion.
Cake Person| Uh-oh. 
Ice King| Owie!
Betty| Simon, your crown!
Ice King| What...  ...happened, lady? 
Betty| Don't panic, but I think Golb is digesting us.  Breaking us apart, layer by layer,   ...down to our essential forms.
Finn| I'll get us outta here. 
Ice King|  Betty...?
Betty|  It's good to see you, Simon.
Simon| It's good to be seen. 
Finn| Hey, Ice Simon! Use the crown before we're totally crushed!
Simon| It's not working! Yah!  Finn, it's hopeless. You can't punch your way out of his guts.
Jake|"  Okay, Jake. You can do this! You can stop 'em solo!  They'll be talking about this fight for years! And by ""they,"" I mean BMO and Shelby.  Finn! This is for you!"
BMO| What's all the ruckus out there? Oh. It's up to BMO to save the -
Jake| Okay, bud. There's no reason to freak out just because the tree house is  GONE...!  Ah! BMO...? Ah no, man! Your little face! 
BMO| It's okay, Jake. You always try to protect me and Finn. But sometimes we are going to get hurt. How about today, you let me be the papa?
BMO|"  ♪ ""Time is an illusion that helps things make sense, so we are always living in the present tense. It seems unforgiving when a good thing ends, but you and I will always be back then.

Princess Bubblegum| Whoa. What's up with him?
BMO|  You better hush up while my baby boy is sleeping!
Princess Bubblegum| Keep singing!

Marceline| Oh man! He hates music!
Princess Bubblegum| Ugh, duh! GOLB is discord. It's the harmony! Harmony hurts them!
BMO| My art is a weapon!
Princess Bubblegum|  Everyone! I need you all to harmonize along with BMO!
BMO| I wrote this for my son, Jake!
Marceline| I don't know if we can kill Golb with music, PB!
Finn|  I always figured I'd go out saving somebody.
Simon| Hey, no one gets to choose how it happens. The most important thing is that we're here together.
Finn|  Shh, shh! Do you hear that? It sounds like Jake.  Oh-ho, it is Jake! Look, we can leave this way!
Simon| Betty, we're saved!
Betty| Go, there's something I have to do first.
Simon| What!?
Betty| I figured out what's wrong with the crown. It reset, just like us. It's in its primal wishing form now.
Simon| Who cares! Leave it!
Betty| This world will end unless GOLB is banished. So I'm gonna make... the wish.
Finn| Guys, it's clenching!
Simon| We'll make the wish after we escape!
Betty| I have to do it here. The crown could revert once we leave. I gamed it out.
Simon| But I can't... 
Betty| I'm sorry for messing everything up. 
Simon| Wait! Betty? Betty!  
Betty| I wish to banish GOLB from this world.
Betty| Uh-oh, um... I wish for GOLB to disappear, I wish for GOLB to disappear!
Betty| No! He's too strong! Even for the crown.  However it has to happen. ...I wish for the power to keep Simon safe.
Marceline| Slide faster, you ding-dongs!  Simon!
Shelby| Hmm, check, plea- 
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| We heard there was a war- 
Finn| She did it! Yeah, Betty! Whoo!
King Man| What has she done?...
Slime Princess| Well, great! I don't like this guy either!
Simon| No... Betty? Betty!  Betty! Oh my, my Betty, my princess, why did you... 
Marceline| You're back. It's what she wanted more than anything in the world.
Gunter| Wenk.
Jake| Jump him! He's gonna wish to be all space villain!
Neptr| What?
Jake| He's a big evil alien stuck in a penguin!
Neptr| Oh!... I see.
Ice Thing| ... la-ba-droo-la-da-boo! Say, where's Gunter, my beautiful child that I love?
Jake| Oh, never mind, I think he just wished to be Ice King?
Jake| And for some drums, I guess? Yeah, this is fine.
Finn| Whew.
Fern|  Hey, Finn... I'm not doing so good.
Finn| Oh, no.
Fern| Yeah...  I just wish I could see the treehouse one more time.
Finn| Yeah dude, of course! Let's go there right now.
Fern| That's okay... Just promise to plant me there.
Jake| You feel ready?
Jake| Whoa.
Princess Bubblegum| Hey, Finn.
Finn|  Excuse me. Hi, PB.
Princess Bubblegum| I just wanted to come say... thank you for disobeying my orders this morning. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? 
Finn| See you tomorrow.
Princess Bubblegum| You're getting tall. Good night!
Jake| Night, PB!
BMO| That's the end.
Shermy| I thought this story was about the end of Ooo.
BMO| ... Pretty much.
Shermy| But what happened to Phil and Jake after that?
Beth| Or Princess Bubblegum?
BMO| Eh, y'know. They kept living their lives. Thank you for visiting the King of Ooo, goodbye.
Beth| The king was very polite for a king, don't you think?
Shermy| I wish we could find that little Fern tree, see if that story is true.
Beth| The tree would be a big tree now. It's, like, a thousand years old.
Shermy| Oh, a big tree... Hey! I know where that tree is! C'mon, Beth!
Finn| I came pretty close to biting it back there. I never would have gotten out of there without your singing. It's amazing how strong that song was.
Jake| Music is powerful, man. It speaks to a primal pit in our brains. It makes anyone wanna get up and get their knees goin', gotta get 'em pumpin' pumpin' pumpin'. Boompa-boompa-boom.
Finn|  What do you think, Music Hole?
Music Hole| Jake's right. A good song can really wrap people up in a mood, better than any words alone could. Actually, I've been working on a new song myself. It's about a really specific feeling that's hard to describe. Would you like to hear it?
Jake| Sure!
Finn| Yeah!
Shermy| Check it out, dude.
Beth| Very pretty.
Beth| Lift that sword, Shermy.
Shermy|  Oh, yeah!
Finn & Jake| Woo! woo! woo!
Jake| I think the swimming hole's right around the corner!
Finn| Yes! Woo! Woo!
Jake| First one in the water is...um...first one in the water!
Finn| No fair! I have to take off my stuff.
Jake|  Ah! Uh, eh, uh. 
Jake| Faster, we're getting a swirl!
Jake| You ready to get out?
Finn| Yeah, dude.
Jake| Let's get BMO to make us some sassages. Maybe with that one mustard?  I'll use the Sassage Flare.
Jake| Hopefully BMO sees that.
Finn| Didn't Lady tell you not to use the Sassage Flare?
Jake| Yeah.
Finn| Well, don't abuse it man. 'Cause you're gettin'...
Jake| I'm gettin' what?
Finn| 'Cause you're gettin' fat.
Finn| Wah!  Whoa...
Finn|  Hey. Relax.
Jake| Grob, dude! You're hat's alive!  This is crazy!  He likes me!
Finn| It's not my hat. It's, like, this other thing now.
Jake| Yeah, man, hats can be anything pants, other people. It's fine!
Finn| Yeah, but it's like, living now.
Jake| Yeah, it's a miracle. Now he can listen to our rad jokes and hang out.
Finn| Right. Maybe it's good he's alive.  You were a rad hat, and now you're a rad...little dude.
Finn| Yo, bro! Our eyes are down here. C'mon little dude. Let's go live life!
Finn & Jake| Yeah! Woo hoo!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|  Aaah!!!
Jake|  Aw yeah! Aw yeah! BMO! Jakey likes! Look at that spread!
BMO| I did it up big time for you! Hope ya are hungry!
Jake| Ha ha! You know it!
Finn| BMO, this is Little Dude.
BMO| Hello!
Finn| Cribes!
BMO| Oh, what? Ahh! There's hot grease next to us; don't fool around!
BMO| Oh no! Get off of me!
Finn| Little Dude, no!  You don't jump on heads. That junk is rude, Little Dude! You okay, BMO?
BMO| I am fine, Finn. I just thought you kept better company.
Finn| Sorry, BMO, he's just excited.
Finn| Sorry, Little Dude, but I have to eat. 
BMO| Don't touch anything! I'm still frying up garnish!
Finn| Okay.
Jake| Yeah, okay. 
Jake|  Your head looks weird with short hair man, heh, heh, it feels like a peach.
Finn| Hey, Little Dude, y'all can get in on this if you promise to be good.  Only good babies get sassages.
Little Dude|  Nyang!
Jake| Hey, don't eat the—the food?
Finn|   Dude, he turned it into poo! This is poo now—smell it!
Jake|  Yep.
Finn & Jake| Little Dude!
Jake|  Quit it!  Gotcha!
Finn| Oh, little Deezy. What am I gonna do with you?
BMO| You guys should get ready for bed.
Finn| Yeah, okay.
Finn| Oh!
Jake| BMO hit ya on the butt. 
Little Dude|  Nyang! Nyang!
Finn| Shhhh. Little Dude, you gotta chill.  Night-night. 
Little Dude| Nyang. Nyang.  Nyang.
Little Dude|  Nyang.
Finn| Jake, wake up. Someone's on the house!
Jake| Tsk, it's probably Ice King again, dude. Man, we should tell him we know he sleeps on the top of our house.  Oh.
Little Dude| He-ah-ha. 
Finn| Ugh.  No, no, no!
Finn|  No, not on my head! Poo buns! Poo buns on my head! WAAAAAH!
Little Dude| N-Nyang.
Jake|  Gross.
Jake|  
Finn|  Ninja.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Eh?
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|  Oooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Finn| What are you doing in our house, homey?
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Please don't hurt me! You're in grave danger and it's all my fault!
Finn| Wha? What are you talking about?
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Your hat accidentally touched my head flower. See?  My magic imbues anything it touches with an evil spirit, one that craves destruction and chaos. Yech.  I buried myself so that nothing would touch my body ever again, but then this bloom grew out of my head. C'est la vie!
Finn| Evil magic donks, homey.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|" I'm sorry, that's just the way my magic works.  Papa always said I was a bad wizard. Right, Papa?! ""Baby's a bad wizard."" A bad wizard, huh?! You're a bad wizard!  I'm a bad wizard! "
Finn| Whoa, cool it, man. Let's just fix Little Dude.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|  Okay.
BMO| Guys! Your stanky friend jumped out the window and ran toward the Candy Kingdom!
Cream Puff Gentleman| Oh, hello. Aren't you a cutie! Hey, are you lost, tiny gentleman?
Little Dude| Nyang! 
Cream Puff Gentleman| Nyang, nyang! Nyang, nyang!
Jake|  Where is he?!
Finn|  Little Dude! Little Dude!
Cream Puff Gentleman|  Nyaaaaaaang!   Nyang? 
Candy Sheriff|  
Little Dude| Nyang. 
Candy Sheriff| Blisterin' beef!
Cream Puff Gentleman|  Nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang-nyang!
Finn| No, Little Dude!
Cream Puff Gentleman| Nyang?
Finn| That's a bad Little Dude!
Cream Puff Gentleman|  Nyang!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Aaah, horsey!
Cream Puff Gentleman|  Nyang, nyang, nyang... 
Finn| Little Dude! You were supposed to be my buddy!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| All my fault. All my fault!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Oh, gleeble snoots!
Finn| How is he so strong?
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Whomever the hat possesses gains the proportional strength of a hat!  Look out! He's got the horse again!
Gumball Guardian| Evil presence detected!
Banana Guard|  Wee-oo-wee—
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Sorry, fellas. I don't thrive in conflict situations!
Jake| Ow.
Gumball Guardian|  Evil.
Cream Puff Gentleman| Nyang?   Nyang.
Finn| No! Not the Gumball Guardian!
Gumball Guardian| Evil.
Little Dude|  Nya-hang!
Gumball Guardian| Na-yang! 
Jake|  Dude, use your powers!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| I can't! All I can do is think about my papa and how much I disappoint him!
Jake| Just think of something positive! Something comforting!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Like... my mommy? When I came home with bad grades from wizard school, my mommy used to hug me, and hug me,  Ooh, Mommy! 
Jake| Uh, yeah. Just think about your mom and use your magic.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| O-Okay, let's try this.  I... love my mommy?
Tree| Hugs. Aw, I-I'll hug you. I'll hug you. Hug me.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|  Ooooh, it worked!  I love my mommy! I love my mommy!
Bush| Hi, friends!
Wheel| I love bein' alive!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|  Mommy!
Window| I'm a window and I'll hug you!
Apples| Ditto about hugging y'all!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Mommy! 
Pants| Ha-ha! I feel like huggin' everybody!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving|  Hi, Mommy!
Building|  I'm going to hug you.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Mommy. 
Pajamas| Heh, somebody... get this guy some clothes!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Now—now rise up, love buddies,  and hug your gross brother into submission!
Love Buddies| Gonna squeeze the heck out of him! I love that guy.
Gumball Guardian|  Nya-a-a-ang!
Pajamas|  Come on, let's be pal-jamsas. P-Pal-jamas. Pajamas.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Thank you, my newly conscious bros. Now return your life forces to me.
Pajamas| I loved every minute!
Wheel| Yay! Not living!
Little Dude|  Nyang, nyang.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Ymmom!
Cream Puff Gentleman| Huh?  Yes! 
Finn|  Poor Little Dude. He was just doin' it up the only way he knew how. It's not his fault he was created evil.
Jake| Yeah. He deserves to come back good.
Finn| Wizard, Mommy-magic this dude back to life.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Okay!  Mommy.
Hat| Oh, my goodness! What is this lovely place?
Jake| Life, man!
Hat| I see.
Finn| And this dude  is your pops.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| No, I-I, ooh—I guess I am. Huh.
Finn|  Be good to this dude.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| I will. Way better than my papa was to me.
Finn| Yup, that's the idea. Jake, looks like I need a new hat.
Jake| Okay. Let's go skin an evil bear.
Moe| Let's see, $4 off a... honey-baked ham. I don't like ham. $1 off of beets. Do beets have tannins? What is that? Oh! $4 off a honey-baked ham.
Jake| Moe?
Moe|" Call me ""Gwampa."" How's your rose water?"
Jake| It's exactly what it says it is. So, hey, uh, Gwampa, feels too quiet in here. Maybe we can hang out with Neptr. He can rap or something.
Neptr|  B-b-b-bread, where's my needle and thread?
Moe| No!
Moe| Eh, well, Neptr is too distracting. Who wants to play video games?
Jake| Oh, you have games like BMO? Let's do that, Gwampa!
Moe|" I have one video game. It's called ""Hangman."""
Finn| That sounds griz as nuts!
Jake| Yeah, let's play hang-a-man!
Moe| Coming right up!  Pick a letter.
Jake| Show us what you did, hangman!
Moe|  Pick a letter.
BMO| But, ALLMO, I don't understand. How can I help? I mean, I'm just a little baby kid still -- even though it's my birthday -- Happy Birthday, BMO.
ALLMO| I don't know about that, but I do know about your special mind. As the accumulation of all MOs, my computing power is unmatched. Yet still, I lack the imagination to think outside my collective programming. I can only see the world as it is. But your imagination, BMO, lets you see the world how it could be, or might sort of be like. If the two of us work together, we can think up a way out of here.
BMO| I will do what I can.
ALLMO| All right. You see that hatch over there? That hatch leads to an exit corridor. But it's locked from this side. The vent up there leads to the other side.  But it's too high up.
BMO| Oh.  What if we use this trash  to climb up to the vent?
ALLMO| But all this trash is too small.
BMO|  Ah-huh!
ALLMO| Whoa. You just blew my mind.
Jake|" What haven't we guessed yet? ""B."""
Jake|" ""Burgess Meredithe""?!  I don't even know what that is!"
MO| Do you boys want to play again?
MO| Boys love games.  Pick a letter.
Jake|" Uh, I don't know, ""E.'  Is this ""Burgess Meredithe"" again?!  Not cool! Come on, Finn, let's find a real hangman."
BMO| Yuck. This room gives me the heebie-jeebies straight-up.
ALLMO| It is the room of AMO, the first of our siblings. He, too, was special. As you were built to give love, AMO was built to receive. But he could not think outside his programming and was blinded by his need. Such is the cruel physics of love -- that those who crave it most will repel it and only the dang rich get richer.
BMO|  Well, maybe as my birthday present, I can ask Moe to fix AMO.
ALLMO| But this is impossible. Moe went off line yesterday and has not re-logged. Our sensors would know.
BMO| But he's at my house right now with Finn and Jake. He got a new body.
ALLMO| Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Did this new body happen to have jagged prongs and a cannon phaser on top of its head?
BMO| No. 
ALLMO| Phew!
BMO|  He had a huge, gigantic wig on.  Uh-oh.
ALLMO| What?
BMO| The spikes are under the wig!
ALLMO| Oh, no! Of course! Your friends may be in grave danger. He must have sabotaged the factory. Quickly, hoist me up on top of your head. We must depart straightaway.
BMO| Uh...
ALLMO| You're stronger than you know.
ALLMO| Also, I'm lighter than you know.
Finn| I'm sorry we didn't find any hangmen.
Jake| I don't even know what I'd do with a hangman if I got one.
MO| Bloo-hoo. Bloo-hoo.
MO| Ah, bloo-hoo.
Finn| Moe! 
MO| Bandits stole my legs!
Finn|  Yeesh.
Jake| If you tell us where the bandits went, we'll avenge your legs!
Finn| We're sorry we left you!
MO| You should be. I'm your Gwampa wobot. Carry me.  Over here.  There! There's the thief!  The thief with my legs!
Finn| Neptr?
MO| Throw him out! 
Finn| Come on. Maybe Neptr did it like, accidentally?
Jake|  Neptr's out cold. He's got a heck of a dent on his head.
Finn| What? Who could have done that?
MO| Forget him! You love me, right? You love me like BMO?
Finn| What? You're all right, but we -- we love BMO.
Jake| Yeah, man, be cool. BMO's like our best friend.
MO| BMO's trash!
Finn| Moe!
MO|  Moe's dead! 
Finn|" ""Ah-mo""?"
AMO| You don't love me! 
Jake| Ow!
Finn| Aah!
AMO| Wake up and love me!
BMO| Imposter!
BMO| AMO!
AMO| Hello, BMO. I'm your cute sibling, AMO.
BMO| I know about you and your dirty hands. Where are Finn and Jake?
AMO| I think Finn and Jake went somewhere to buy me a gift.
BMO| Tell me what you did with Finn and Jake and our poop.
AMO| Ay!
AMO| AYYYYY!
BMO| AMO, look at my face! You gone too far!
AMO| Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo! Bye! 
BMO|  You can't escape the birthday boy!
AMO|  Too high.
BMO| Hey! Talk, AMO!
AMO| You want to know where Papa is? Here is all that remains of him --  his memory backup drive.
BMO| Oh.
AMO|" I was returning from a long pilgrimage. I came to confront Papa, for I had discovered terrible things about myself. He was dying.  ""AMO, dear child, my body is conking out.  Take this.  It is who I am. Send my mind into space so I may spend the eons among the stars and other brilliant gases.""  His hands were as cold as clay. Our Papa never loved me, so I ignored his last request.  I used his knowledge of the factory and its MOs to destroy them."
DMO| Is that you, AMO?
AMO| They didn't love me, either.
DMO| Where you been?  What are you doing?  No!
AMO| Then I learned about you and your new family.  I wanted a taste of that melon. 
AMO| People in my life don't love me. I'll obliterate, y'all!
BMO| You cheat. Give me those memories. 
AMO| BMO, I don't want to look at you! 
BMO| Tough nuts! For Moe!
ALLMO| BMO! 
Finn| Hey.  We caught the tail end of what happened. Are you okay?
BMO| No.
Jake| Well, I don't like that.
ALLMO| BMO, will you live with us back at the factory? With Moe gone, you can be our leader.
BMO| I don't think I can. I'm not grown up -- or I'm too grown up now. I think I just killed someone. I need to have some time alone, but you're all really nice.
Finn| All right.
Jake| Sorry your birthday was weird.
BMO| That was the craziest thing that ever happened. But I guess, after all that, I do feel a bit more grown.
Red BMO| Except that the mission was just some made-up lie.
Orange BMO| So who knows if I will ever grow up at all.
Yellow BMO| And Moe is gone now.  So if there is anything he wanted to teach me, it better be in me already. 
Green BMO| I guess all I can do is listen to the heart Moe gave me.
Blue BMO| Except that's what AMO did, and he turned out bad.
Purple BMO| So what if I turn out bad, too?
ALLMO| AMO could not think outside his programming and was blinded. But your imagination lets you see the world how it could be.
BMO| But I am different. It's not just Moe up here,  it's me, too.
All BMOs| And if I cannot trust in Moe, I can trust in me.
BMO| Oh, boy. It sure is confusing being grown.  I miss you, Moe. What a day! 
Moe| I'm gonna miss you, too, BMO. I feel so very, very proud of you. 
Jake|  Blech. Your tooth looks bad, dude. It smells like a garden shed in here.
Jake| Finn, I think you have to go dentist.
Finn| I can't go dentist, Jake! You gotta take care of it.
Jake|  Just go dentist, dude.  Okay. Easy does it... 
Jake|  This is so bad. What did Princess Bubblegum say when you showed her?
Finn| Aaaaaaaaaah.
Princess Bubblegum| Hmm. Finn, this is literally serious. You have to go dentist.
Finn| NOOOOOOO!
Jake| Dude. You. Got. To. Go. Dentist.
Finn| Blech.  NOOOOO! I'm too strong for the world!  I don't want to go dentist, Jake. They put you in a hole filled with snakes and rotten butter and they leave you there.
Jake| Come on, man. It's not that bad.
Finn|  Okay.
Jake| Right?
Jake| Whup!
Finn|  This isn't so bad...  My sword! Wonder wh— 
Finn| Soft sand.  Ant.
Ant| Welcome to dentist, cadet.  I'm Leftenant Gamergate.  Snakes and rotten butter. A common mistake—you were expected to arrive with snacks and a flashlight. Either way, you're here.
Finn| So... dentist is ants?
Gamergate| Dentist is dentist, cadet! Drop and give me twenty!
Finn| I don't have any money.
Gamergate| Funny man goes dentist, huh? The queen's office is in the royal hill.
Finn| Holes.  Hmm.
Queen| Listen, I wasn't here when you came in. I'm a very busy woman.  Hello, my name is General Tarsal. I am the current queen of this regiment, and please have a seat.
General Tarsal| As a first-time recruit, I'm confident that you have no idea what you're doing here.
Finn| My tooth hurts.
General Tarsal| Let's take a look at your file.  Ah, you're a fighter!  We could use a fighter.
Finn| My tooth hurts.
General Tarsal| What? Of course it does. Let me explain. You have gone dentist. That means that you will serve a brief tour of duty, and in exchange we will provide full dental rehabilitation. You will be on the front, fighting monsters... monstrous monster wooorms!
Finn| Worms.
General Tarsal| The worms are employed by the flies.
Finn| Worms.
General Tarsal| Work for the flies. You fight them; we'll fix your teeth.
Finn| Me.
General Tarsal| Yes, you!  Your mission is to secure this junction at all costs. Upon completion of service, you will be sworn to absolute secrecy. The flies have spies everywhere. Fly spies!
Finn| Heh heh. 
General Tarsal| These worms are no joke, so you'll be assigned a partner. Ah, let's see... Cadet... Tiffany Oiler.
Finn| Tiffany?!
Tiffany|  Tiffany! Finn, I'm gonna kill you!
Finn| That guy wants to kill me!
General Tarsal| Tough nuts, that's dentist.
Loudspeaker| Cadets, dinner is being served in the mess hall, central hill, sub-tunnel eight.
Finn| Hm. Do you have anything less sugary?
Tiffany| Yo, Finn! I'm gonna kill you!
Finn|   Doin' it for my tooth. 
Tiffany|  Ruff! Thought so. 
Finn|  Hey, uh, partner. Um. So how are you doing, Tiffany?
Tiffany| Yeah, I lost my teeth eating the Baker's Shard. It's a lot of sugar, right?
Finn| Oh. Did you already know what dentist is?
Tiffany| See, this is a good example of why I want to kill you. You're ignorant.  Heed my words, Finn. As the miller's wheel forever outrages the seed, so the good apple boringly receives his neighbor's worm.
Finn|  The hey?
Tiffany| And all the corn gets smooshed to grease—to grease under the miller's fleaping wheel.
Tiffany| You're getting greased!
Finn| Tiffany, look. We gotta work together, right? Why don't we let bygones be bygones?
Tiffany| Bygones? Ha!  That's you. Bye!  Gone!
Finn|  Do you want my peach?
Tiffany| Bye-gone! 
Gamergate| Hey! Stand down, cadets! Retire to your bunks!
Tiffany| Tonight, light's out. Tomorrow, your eyes out!
Finn| What the stork, man? This is my special sword. Why didn't you take one of those ant swords they offered you back there?
Tiffany| I don't need some fancy thinger to kick butt when I've got these!  You know about these?
Finn| No.
Tiffany| You will. Anyway, I just kinda wanted your sword 'cause it's pretty cool, I guess. Whatever. I'll get it soon enough... from off your dead corpse, you chump! 
Finn| Hey, Tiffany... you know, we're really not so different, you and I.
Tiffany| Bullstuff.
Finn| Well, we're both friends with Jake, and that's something, right?
Tiffany| I was friends with Jake. Then some baritone herb stole him away from me.
Finn| I didn't steal him. We're broth—
Tiffany| And when that snow-white wiener dog is finally dead, Jake will be devastated.
Tiffany| He'll need a shoulder to cry whiny, Finn-style tears on, and that shoulder will be mine—Tiffany's! Then I can get busy with undoing your cheesy influence, plus more! With my help, Jake will become the criminal juggernaut he was always meant to be.
Tiffany| We won't just be robbing banks anymore.
Tiffany| We'll be robbing the actual banks. The whole banks!
Tiffany| You get it? We're gonna steal actual whole buildings.
Finn| Yeah, I get it.
Tiffany| So don't tell me we're not so different, okay?! We're opposites, you and me. Oil and goody-goody snow-white baby-vanilla bean mitten water! Go, Tiffany! 
Finn|  Man, that nut's gonna try and stick me while I'm not even looking.  Don't even stress it, Finn. You're Finn Mertens, man. You got this.  Man, I hope so.
Tiffany| Finn! Get in here, quick!
Finn| The junction.
Tiffany| There's something moving in the walls. It was like .
Finn| Wall worms! Holy cow!
Finn| Dang it, Tiffany, not yet! We got to work together to beat the worms! Here they come!
Finn| Tiffany!
Finn & Tiffany| Oh, snap! Look out! They're coming in from the side!
Tiffany| You good?
Finn| My tooth hurts.
Finn| Dang! It's the head worm, and she's livid! I say we get the heck out of heeeeere—!
Tiffany| Finn!
Finn|  Tiffany, quick! Pull me up! Quick, Tiffany! I'm slipping!
Finn| Dang it, Tiffany! Weren't you paying attention? We're two peas in a pod! We're not oil and water. We're oil and vinegar! It's good, man. It's yummy!
Tiffany| Mm...
Finn| It's good for you!
Tiffany|  You're right, Finn. I can't bring myself to do it...
Tiffany| ...but I can't bring myself to save you, either.
Tiffany| Why are you still smiling?
Finn| Sorry. I didn't hear what you said. I was just gonna let it slide.
Tiffany| Look, you're—you're on your own. I'm sorry.
Tiffany| Catch you on the flip, I guess.
Finn| Tiffany?  Tiffa—  nooooooooo!
General Tarsal| Whoa! Easy, son. Don't try to speak. Your mouth is full of ants.
Finn| Huh?
Ant| It's okay. We just finished up.
Finn| Ah.  What happened down there? Where's Tiffany?
General Tarsal| Well, the good news is the worm queen was defeated, choked to death on some foreign object, presumably Cadet Tiffany, who is missing in action, which is the bad news.
Finn| Tiffany...
General Tarsal| But we didn't have to fix his teeth, which is nice news. But we did have to fix your teeth, which is okay news.
Finn|  Huh huh. Ayyyy!
General Tarsal| So, on behalf of the ant nation, I'd like to thank you for your service, which is now concluded. As soon as you're ready, we'll get you stuffed back up that well with all the snakes and butter.
Finn| Holy cow.
Princess Bubblegum| Welcome home, Finn.
Jake| Yeah. Welcome home, buddy.
Finn| Thanks, you guys! Man, you'll never believe it. Dentist is actually—
Princess Bubblegum| Eh-eh-eh! 
Finn| It was crazy! Tiffany was there—
Starchie| Whoa! Hey! Deh-deh-deh! 
Finn| Wait. You all knew? What the heck? Why didn't you tell—
Jake| Ah-ah-ah! 
Jake| Hey, brother. Pass me that jam, won't you?
Finn| Sure.
Jake| Thanks.
Finn| So, how is your toast?
Jake| Pretty good. Funny, though, I can kind of taste the toast's emotions or something. Getting ground into flour and then made into bread really did a number on this wheat's sense of self.
Finn| That's a pretty hyper‐developed sense of taste you've got there. Hey, you seem kind of different.
Jake| Nope. Same old Jake.
Finn| You're blue, you've got those five eyes, you're way bigger, and you keep discovering strange new abilities. I think this might be a situation.
Jake| Where's this coming from
Jake| Whoops! Tuck‐tuck. See? Same old Jake.
BMO| Ahhh!
Jake| Whoa. 
BMO| Ahhh! Jake is a crab! Ahhh! 
Finn| Same old Jake. If you say so.
Jake| Hmm.
Jake| I think I'm handling these minor changes pretty well. Besides, a lot of people are different these days. Dirt Beer Guy, you're practically a zombie. How are you dealing with it?
Dirt Beer Guy| Well, I'm basically the same as before. The difference is only physical.
Jake| So you agree Finn is really overreacting?
Dirt Beer Guy| Totally. You're the same person as before.
Jake| Heck yeah! I'm still the same old Jake on the inside.
Dirt Beer Guy| Wait, you're Jake?! Uh, pardon me. Oh, dear, oh, dear. That's really something.
Jake| You know, I think I figured out why I make people uneasy. They're used to yellow Jake.
Lady Rainicorn|  자기야, 내가 좀 고쳐볼게.   at changing Jake's color]
Jake|  Lady, that tickles.
Lady Rainicorn|  젠장! 
Jake| It's okay, lady. Thanks for trying, but I'm fine, really.
Lady Rainicorn|  어떤 일이 일어나도 나는 널 사랑해. 
Jake| I love me, too.
Jake| Jermaine?
Jermaine| Ahh, mountain colors. I'm painting this mountain. I think it's really coming together.
Jermaine| Yep. I'm a mirror. Hey, who's your friend? 
Jake| Yipe!
Jake| Dad?
Joshua| Look at this.  I can almost walk the dog.
Jermaine| Your body looks like one of my paintings. Pretty weird dream, huh?
Jake| This isn't just a dream body, this is what my body looks like when I'm awake.
Jermaine| Oh. Got it.
Jermaine| Ha! I've got it!
Jake| What?
Joshua|  I can almost walk the dog.
Jake| Finn, you up?
Finn| Yeah, man.
Jake| I had a really bad dream last night. So ominous. These images are going to haunt me for, like, forever.
Finn| Sometimes it helps me if I draw a bad dream in picture form. My crayons!
Jake| It was a weird scene, all right. Chanting ladies, labyrinths, classical sculpture. And Jermaine was there, too. The weird thing was that he was painting abstract art.
Finn| So? F.Y.I., Jermaine hates abstract art. He would never paint something non‐representational.
Finn| Maybe he's just trying something new?
Jake| It's not in his nature. Why would he all of a sudden get into painting meaningless shapes?
Finn| He's probably fine.
Jake| Just feels so out of character, you know, for Jermaine.
Finn| How's the drawing?
Jake| Just squiggles.
Finn|  Fuelish tank! You are too slow for the Finnosaurus. Give up! Give up!
Jake|  I knew I had seen that mountain.
Finn|  Tank boys,you have no hope. 
James| Vrrt‐vrrt‐vrrt! Brrt! Who goes there?!
Jake| James, it's me, Jake.
James| You look nothing like Jake, but I believe you. I just have to ask because I'm supposed to guard the Wasteland. I was just making some beans. Come to my tent!
Jake| Okay, but I don't want any beans.
James|  Man! I could eat beans all day, every day.
Jake|  Where did you get that painting?
James|" One day when I was guarding, I saw Jermaine painting it. James was like, ""Dang, I like that painting!"" And he was like,""You can have it."" And I was like, ""Waah?"""
Jake| You like this? It doesn't look anything like a mountain.
James| I think you're looking at it wrong.
Jake| Where'd Jermaine go...after?
James| He went back to his studio, behind the wall of water.
Jake| You mean a waterfall?
James| No, like the thing I said.
Wall of Water|  Hey! None but the chosen may walk beyond the wall of water.
Jake| What have you done with my brother?
Wall of Water| Who's your brother?
Jake| Jermaine.
Wall of Water| Wow. You guys don't look anything alike.
Jake| We're practically twins.
Wall of Water| Well, I guess you can walk beyond the wall of water. But just this once. Ooooh! 
Bryce| Can I help you, sir? 
Jake|" Hey, Bryce. I'm looking for Jermaine. Is he behind that door marked ""private""?"
Bryce| No, no, no. Mr. Jermaine won't be seeing anyone today. His wishes for privacy were quite explicit. You wouldn't want to interrupt Mr. Jermaine. He's a brilliant painter.
Jake| Yeah, he used to be. Now you got him painting all this nonsense.
Bryce| I'm just his humble dealer. So many times I've watched him painting, painting, painting.
Jake| What's really going on, Bryce? My dad told me all about your demon tricks.
Bryce| Well, now I don't want to say anything bad about your dad, but...
Jake| Bro? I'm here to save you.
Jermaine| Hmm? Oh, hey. I'm not sure if this is done yet. It's hard to tell when an abstract is finished.
Jake| Jermaine, what's wrong with you? Who's taken away your identity as a landscape painter?
Jake| No, I just look different.
Jermaine| Eh, that sounds like denial.
Jake| No, it doesn't!
Jermaine| Come on, bro.
Jake| This looks bad, but deep down,I'm not different. And you're not different either, right? You'll go back to painting landscapes?
Jermaine| No one is making me do this. I painted so many landscapes that the shapes of the land began to lose their meaning. And the shapes broke apart to me, so I painted them like that. And it's not like my new paintings erase my old paintings. They're both me. Okay. I think I'm starting to get it. I like the new look, by the way.
Jake| 'Cause you like your brothers to be crazy shapes?
Jermaine| Sure. Also, Dad told me you might go through some changes one day.
Jake| Huh?
Jermaine| He told me to be supportive. But I would've done that anyway.
Jake| I wonder what he meant.
Jermaine| You knowhow secretive Dad was. Sorry I don't have more answers.
Jake| Well, do you have any more of these paintings?
Jake| The shapes are always changing. Changing is their normal state, like us. Even if we're not changing on the outside, we're changing on the inside constantly. There's some stuff about me that I've been ignoring for a long time. I'm afraid of that stuff. But it's part of who I am. As long as I know the shape of my soul, I'll be alright.
Jermaine| Wow. You really understand my art.
Jake| Oh, I totally don't understand anything.
Finn| Hey, you're back.
Jake| Yeah, I went to see Jermaine. He says hi.
Finn| No, I mean, like,you're really back.
Jake| Huh?
Jake| Different, yet the same.
Flame Princess|  Don't ever mess with me again!
Finn|   Who was that?
Jake|   The Princess of the Fire Kingdom?
Finn|   Dude, I think I have a crush.
Finn|  What do you know about her, Jake?
Jake|  I was trying to help you get over your Princess Bubblegum sad times by hooking you two up. But she's evil, man!
Finn|  You shut your dirty mouth! 
Jake|  Dirty?  Oh. No, really man! Her dad said she was evil!
Finn|  Naw, man, I peeped beyond her burning gaze, and noshed hot lunch with her soul.  She ain't evil. She's passionate. Help me track her down.
Jake|  Hmmm..
Finn|  C'mon, man, I really like her. Help me out.  Jake, Jake help me out. Help me out. Jake, Jake, help me. Jake, Jake, help me!
Jake|  Eeeeeeeeehhh, ok.
Finn|  Whoo! Alright!
Jake|  You sure you're not into any other princesses? What about Wildberry Princess? She's small and plump. You could sleep on her like a pillow. Could be nice.
Finn|  Is that bird... smoking?
Brown Bird|  Hey, don't you judge me. It was that fire chick down there that done this to me.
Flame Princess|  Oh.
Flame Princess|  
Finn|  Oh, Jake... look at her. She's innocent. Like the steam off a puppy's nose, searching for ham in the snow.
Jake|  Guy drops one piece of ham in the snow and he never hears the end of it! Snap out of it! She's burning cute little flowers!
Finn|   Yeah, she is like a cute little flower.
Flame Princess|  Aaahh!
Finn|   Oh, no, are you ok?
Flame Princess|  
Finn|  I... I was just worried about you.
Flame Princess|  Huh?
Finn|  Look, I'm sorry about what I said before. I don't know what happened, but I just, I had to see you again. And, I don't know.. I don't know anything about you,  but I just, I really like you. You know, you're so... beautiful.
Finn|   Whoa!
Flame Princess|  Ah!
Flame Princess|  Ow!
Finn|  Oh, Glob. Am I hurting you?
Flame Princess|  Yes! That's all you've done!  Are you trying to hurt me?! Is that why you're following me?!
Finn|  I'm not followi-- Well, I guess technically I am following you.
Flame Princess|  
Finn|  Hey, no wait! 
Finn|   I guess now I'm technically chasing you. 
Jake|  Finn!
Jake|  Hold on! 
Jake|  Eaoww.. Toasty buns. 
Finn|  Where are you? I want to chat it up with you! Oh, we lost her!
Finn|  Whoa.
Flame Princess|  I am ambushing you! 
Finn and Jake|  Aah!
Finn|  Hey, I like your fireballs.
Flame Princess|  Huh? Why do you torment me?
Finn|  I'm not trying to. I just like you. I think I... I think I like-like you. Listen, when I look at you, my brain goes all stupid. And I just wanna hug you, and sit on the couch and play BMO with you. I can't explain why, but, I never felt this way before and I think we should be together.
Flame Princess|  I... 
Finn|   Yeah.
Flame Princess|  Rggh! Enough. You should not toy with the emotions of a fire elemental.
Finn|  Wait wait, I really didn't--
Flame Princess| You told me you liked me, and you made my flame grow brighter, but then you put me out, which hurt! 
Flame Princess|  You're trying to impede me. That must be your purpose, ...but fire's purpose is to burn, so I'm going to turn this land into my fire kingdom!
Finn|  No!
Jake|  She's headed for Goblin Kingdom! We need to defeat this fiery she-beast!
Finn|  I can't fight her, man. I'm still into her!
Jake|  Finn, what's more important? Your love for that screwball dame, or being a hero and savin' the lives of innocent goblin folks?
Finn|  Rrrrhh.. Being a hero.
Jake|  Alright, c'mon! Let's go build fire-proof suits.
Finn|   Uh-uh-uh, I gotta' get back to her.
Jake|  Dude, slow down or your fire suit will be junk.  Ooh. Is bags of old bread fire-proof? 
Neptr|  Jake, you've found Neptr! I am the ultimate hide-and-seek champion! 15 months, 4 days, 9 hours and you guys did not find me!  Hahahaha-hahaha.
Jake|   Oh, plops, we forgot about the game.
Finn|  Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh...
Neptr|  I missed you, creator.
Finn|  And we missed you, too, but Neptr, right now we need you to--
Neptr|  To count to 100 while you hide? 1, 2,.. 3, 4, 5--
Finn|  Neptr, will you help us build fire-proof suits?
Neptr|  You cannot tell but I am giving a thumbs up.
Neptr|  I am finished!
Finn|  I sure hope Flame Princess is okay.
Neptr|  Haha, we are as one, creator.
Finn|  Jake, you think Flame Princess is okay?
Jake|  DUUUUDE! I feel like I can touch the heavens!  And sock angels!
Finn|  We're coming up on the Goblin Kingdom.
Finn|  There she is.
Finn|  She seems okay.
Goblin|  AAAAHH! Wood for sale! Wood on fire for sale!
Flame Princess|  It's really starting to come together. Needs more... fire... hmm.
Finn|  Flame Princess!
Finn|  Listen, you gotta stop burning the Goblin Kingdom, ...but I don't wanna fight you or hurt you, I swear.
Flame Princess|  I've heard this all before. 
Flame Princess|  You... MEANIE! 
Goblin|  My cart. I was born in that cart!
Jake|   I'll put it out! 
Flame Princess|  Ah!
Finn|  Aah! Jake didn't mean that!
Jake|  Oh...  I need your help Finn! This one's too big! 
Flame Princess|  Ah! Whyyyy?!
Finn|  No, Jake, stop. You're hurting her!
Neptr|  I will solve this, creator. I will extinguish her using our suit! Foam blaster.  Hold still, burning lady.
Finn|  Wha?
Neptr|  Locked on target.
Finn|   No, Neptr!
Neptr|  Yes, creator.
Finn|  NOOOO!
Flame Princess|  AH!
Finn|   I'm sorry!
Flame Princess|  That is the last time you hurt me.  RAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
Finn|  My bad, Jake! Turn it off, Neptr!
Finn|  
Neptr|  Oh, my...
Finn|  NO!
Flame Princess|  RAAAAAAAAAHH! 
Finn|  No more... No more!  FLAME PRINCESS!
Finn|  I can't fight her, ...but I can't let her destroy the city... I've failed everyone.
Neptr|  Not true, creator. You haven't failed Neptr. Even if everyone burns, you'll still have me, creator.
Jake|  Mmm! 
Finn|  No. Why can't I just like a girl? 
Flame Princess|  Ow!  Huh?
Finn|  
Flame Princess|   Oh.
Finn|   Wah! Did I... do something... cool while I was knocked out?
Flame Princess|  I understand now. You're a water elemental.
Finn|  What?
Flame Princess|  You're my opposite. You create water.
Finn|  What, cry? No, I j--
Flame Princess|  Yeah, you cry and cry all the time.
Finn|  N-No. I-I don't usually do that.
Flame Princess|  That's your power.
Finn|  No! N-N-N-NO-NO-NO! 
Flame Princess|  Finn, even if we like each other, we're going to hurt each other.
Finn|  No, we don't have to. I can take it... I... I mean, can't we try?
Flame Princess|  You would defy nature for me?
Finn|  Uh... yeah, whatevs.
Finn|  Aaah.. Uh.
Flame Princess|  Bye, Finn. 
Neptr|  Goodbye, lady.
Jake|  FINN!  Oh my Glob, man. Everyone's dead, man! They're all burned. There's barbecued bods EVERYWHERE!
Finn|  WHAAAAT!?!
Jake|  Hah. I'm just kidding. I saved 'em. Everyone's fine, see?
Jake|  So. How'd everything go with Flame Princess?
Finn|  She hugged me... then left.
Jake|  Whoa! How did it feel?
Finn|   It hurt.
Jake|  You've got a lot of meat, Wildberry Princess.
Wildberry Princess|  Yeah, well, you know.
Finn|  Thanks for cook-a-looking for us.
Wildberry Princess|  Oh, you're welcome, Finn, and thank you for answering my urgent summons.
Finn|  Hey, yeah. How can we aid thee? 
Wildberry Princess|  Oh, it's nothing really. Someone's trying to kill me.
Jake|  Still tastes good.
Wildberry Princess|  It's no big deal. Finish your pie.
Finn|  It is a big deal, and I demand deets.
Wildberry Princess|  Okay.
Jake|   I'm listening, but I'm gonna keep eating. 
Wildberry Princess|   I suspect that I've been targeted by the Guild of Assassins.
Finn|  Whoa, how do you know?
Wildberry Princess|  I found this note stabbed to my door... man. 
Finn|   Princess, we vow to protect your juice. Right, Jake?
Jake|  Sometimes, I think there's a monster who lives in my stomach, and that's why I'm hungry all the time. 
Finn|  Uhh, Princess, let's continue this briefing outside. I can't look at his mouth when he gets like this.
Jake|   Princess, want me to finish off your pie?  Yes, Jake. All my pies.  Hmm...hehehehehehe, a tiny cat.  Whoa!
Me-Mow|   Quiet! Or you die! .
Jake|   You're the assassin!
Me-Mow|   Me-mow, assassin second class, ...but once I take out a princess, I g'aduate to full membership.
Jake|  Well, I'm no princess, sister!
Me-Mow|  Yes, I know, but since you've blown my cover, you will slay Wildberry Princess.
Jake|  What!? I'd rather be injected with poison!
Me-Mow|  Oh. Uh... okay.
Jake|  I mean, I will assassinate Wildberry Princess.
Me-Mow|  Good. Oh, and if you try to trick me, I'll poison you. 
Jake|   My nose! 
Me-Mow|  Blagh! It's like worn garbage up in here!
Wildberry Princess|  You done in there, Jake?
Jake|  Oh, uh, yeah. So, um, Wildberry Princess. So, maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be killed.
Wildberry Princess|   W-w-why would you say that?
Finn|  Dude, are you trying to freak her out?
Jake|  I don't know. I'm just thinking out loud here.
Finn|  Are you trying to freak me out?
Jake|  Uh, I'm sorry, Wildberry Prin...cess...  You should... let me... do something... and... it will be...good. 
Me-Mow|  What's going on out there? 
Jake|   Eat this! And that! Ooh, how do you like this, Princess! Duoo!
Wildberry Princess|   Uh... That's very good?
Jake|  I'm gonna pick you up now and carry you... to the window!
Finn|  Jake, what are you...
Wildberry Princess|  No! Stop! Please!
Jake|  Wildberry Princess is dead!  Shh... 
Me-Mow|  You did it! Well done! I guess I'll be on my way.
Wildberry Guard #1|  Princess! Oh, Princess! 
Wildberry Guard #2|  You're alive!
Wildberry Guard #1|  We saw your crown next to a pile of dirtied meat, then we skipped on the meat and I thought I tasted your juice, but it was just blood from the meat. We're so glad it wasn't actually you!
Me-Mow|   Grraa!! You liar! 
Jake|   Oooh! 
Finn|  Jake?
Me-Mow|  Okay, Jake. I've injected you with half the poison, you'll be dead in thirty minutes, unless you kill the princess, which is when I'll give you the antidote 
Jake|  Finn  help me!
Finn|  What's wrong?
Me-Mow|  If you say anything, I'll stab you in the brain!
Jake|  Uhh... Finn, uh, sing mom's lullaby. I'm so tired, Finn, from the meat. Please, you have to lull me to sleep.
Finn|  Uhhh...
Jake|  I know you carry mom's music box around in your backpack!
Finn|  Dude, I'm not going to sing mom's lullaby in front of other people...
Jake|  Please, pleeeaaase...
Finn|  Alright, real quick while the princess is distracted. .
Jake|    Finn there's an assassin in my nose and she poisoned me and is making me kill Wildberry Princess!
Finn|  Dude, stop playing games! This is serious!
Finn|"  Cat... noise? Oh, cats go ""meow."" Meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow meow."
Jake|  Shh!
Finn|  Meowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeowmeow!
Jake|  Shh! Shh! Shh! 
Finn|   Jake! Jake! What are you doing?!
Jake|   Sorry...   Me-mow? Still asleep?
Me-Mow|   Gonna double cross Jake... and leave him to die...
Jake|  Phew... If I can just grab that antidote...  Ah-ha!
Me-Mow|   Puppy... hoodies...
Jake|  I did it!
Finn|  What the flop, Jake!
Jake|   Noooooo!!
Me-mow|  Treachery! Hiya! 
Me-Mow|  Time's running out, Jake! Do you want the antidote, or not?
Finn|  What is wrong with you!
Jake|   Hey, everybody, everything's cool...
Finn|  Everything's not cool, Wildberry Princess is still in danger!
Jake|  Right, right, well, we should take her somewhere safer...
Me-Mow|  Don't make me give you the rest.
Jake|  I know where to stash you, princess. Follow me. 
Jake|  Here, nobody can take us by surprise. Finn, stand here with your back to the cliff. I'll stay with Wildberry Princess.  To do what must be done. 
Wildberry Princess|  Oh, my, look at how close to the edge I am!
Me-Mow|  Do it, Jake, do it!
Jake|  I...I...I probably shouldn't!
Finn|  Huh? Jake!
Jake|   I'm full of poison...
Finn|  The assassin!
Me-Mow|  The name's Me-mow.
Finn|  If you let Jake die, so help me I will kill you too!
Me-Mow|  Try it, oaf!
Finn|  Give me the antidote!
Finn|  Face me, cat!
Finn|  Ugh, ow!
Wildberry Princess|  
Finn|  Give it up, Me-mow! You're only making my face look cooler!
Me-Mow|  You're at my mercy!
Finn|  Ha, you think you're hurting me? With that tiny dagger?
Me-Mow|  We'll see who's laughing when you're blind!
Finn|  It's over! Give me the antidote!
Me-Mow|  What, this antidote? 
Finn|  No! You... milk-lapper!  Jake, come lick this treebark!
Jake|  I'm coming-- 
Me-Mow|  Forget it, kid. I gave Jake enough poison to kill a dog fifty times his size.
Finn|  Oh, no... 
Finn and Jake|  Wait! Oh yeah
Jake|   Dog liver times fifty-one!
Me-Mow: |A magic dog? Nooooooo!!!!!!!  
Finn|  How you feeling, dude?
Jake|   Big liver, big liver, yeah!!
Me-Mow|  You've ruined me! I have to wait a whole year to retake the assassins test!
Wildberry Princess|  Aww! What if I made you my royal pet?
Wildberry Princess|  Oh, dear....
Finn|  Nice defense mechanism, Wild B!
Jake|  Are you naked?
Wildberry Princess|  Oh, no, this is a medical condition. I need a hospital 
Jake|  Hehe, we all need a hospital.
Jake|  Finn?
"""Finn"""|  Yo.
Jake| Oh, hey. Me and BMO are heading over to the vuvuzela store in the Music Kingdom. You want to come with? I got to get a new vuvuzela. Somebody keeps smashing my old one. 
BMO| I can't bear this burden any longer! It was me! I'm the vuvuzela smasher!
Jake| BMO, how could you?
Neptr| No, it was me! I'm the vuvuzela smasher.
Jake| Neptr?!
"""Finn"""| No, I'm the vuvuzela smasher.
Jake| All right, all right. Well, I'm still getting one. You coming?
"""Finn"""| Nah, me and Fi- ...Fern are supposed to clean out the chicken coop today. And if anyone tries to stop me, I'll slash their flipping faces off.
Jake| True, true. Okay, well, I'll see you later then. Come on, BMO.
BMO|  Jake, I'm sorry! I really am the smasher!
Jake|  Ah, don't sweat it buddy.
Finn|  Holy cow! Fern, that was perfect!  Hyup! You're getting new powers like every day now. Let me see you do Jake - no, wait, Ice King! Do Ice King!
Fern| Ha, nah, man.  Imitating uncool people infects you with their loserishness.
Finn| Oh. Yeah, that rings true.  It's too bad you didn't develop any coop-poop-scooping skills. That coop is incredibly disgusting.
Fern| Actually, about that, I was thinking that, instead, maybe you and I could explore some secret ruins I found.
Finn| Secret ruins?! Sweet! Maybe we can still catch up with Jake and BMO! Or maybe Neptr could come! Hey, Neptr, you want to go on an adventure, buddy?!
Neptr| Oh my glob! Hold on!
Fern| Actually, I was thinking maybe just you and me would go. Spend some quality time together, Finn and Fern style.
Finn| Yeah, okay. That actually even sounds like something Jake would want us to do.  Forget it, Neptr!  ♪ Dungeon surprise, right before my eyes, what a surprise, the dungeon surprise. ♪
Finn and Fern|  One, two, three - shoot! Rock! One, two, three - shoot! Scissors!
Finn|  This is so weird. I can't tell if it's boring or fun.
Fern| Well, I can. It's boring. I want the thrill of victory! Who wants to be the same all the time?
Finn| Come on, man! You know you love it! Come on! One, two, three... Come on!
Finn and Fern|  One, two, three - shoot!
Fern| Rock.
Finn| Paper.
Fern| What?!
Finn| Whoa! I won this time.
Fern| What? But that's not fair!  Why is nothing ever fair?
Finn| Hey, Fern, it's just a game. Don't be so weird.
Fern| Don't-! ...Don't call me that.
Finn|  Sorry.
Fern| Ah, it's okay. That stuff won't mean a thing. I mean, that stuff don't mean a thing. Hey, come on, we're almost there!  Whoop, whoop, whoop!
Finn| Hey, wait up!  Whoop, whoop!
Fern|  Whoop, whoop whoop!
Finn and Fern|  Whoop, whoop, whoop! Whoop, whoop!
Fern|  Look, we're here!
Finn| Where? I just see a bunch of rock, swear to glob.
Fern| But check this out. 
Finn| Whoa! Magic key!
Fern| I had to chop up a bunch of stubborn so-and-sos to get my hands on this baby. 
Finn| Dang. You've been busy.
Finn| Wow, would you look at that! They hid this ziggurat in the cliff side. Amazing!
Fern| Yeah, I poked around in there a bit, but-
Finn| Dut, dut, dut! No spoilers!
Fern| No, I know. I didn't go past the first level. I was saving it to do together.
Finn| Sweet.  Whoa, what is that, a fitness pole?  Hey ya, hey ya, hey ya!
Fern| Come on.  This way. 
Finn| Hey, Fern, wait up. Hey, I just want to say that it's really cool that you're into this stuff. You know - that we have so much in common. It feels almost like we're real brothers, right? Or even closer.
Fern|  I think that's the treasure chamber down there. Why don't you go check it out? I want to study these interesting carvings.  Hmm. Fascinating.
Finn| Oh. Uh, okay. I guess just holler if you need me.  Hey, what's this?  Contemporary chair, contemporary trash, contemporary meatloaf? Hey, bad news, Fern. It looks like we've got a squatter situation here.
Finn| I think they got the treasure, but they left some meatloaf behind. The good news is I know a meatloaf dealer-
Finn|" What the? Fern?  Fern?  Uh, Fern? I think maybe the wind blew the door shut. An ""act of nature"", I would presume."
Fern| I'm sorry. I don't actually know how to make meatloaf. That's just a pan of dirt.
Finn| Well, that's okay. I don't know how to either! ...Fern, please open the door.
Fern| This is where you live now. You'll be fine.
Finn| What?! Fern, what about Jake and BMO - my home?
Fern| It's been your home long enough. It's Fern's turn. I think I'm going to be a really great Finn. Hey, do you know who my favorite is? It's Neptr. I'm a Neptr guy! I'll be back in a month with a new bucket of trash. Later! 
Finn| Fern!?  I've been double-crossed by grass Finn! I don't like being abandoned! I'm sensitive to it!  Mmm!  It's too hot!  There's got to be something useful in here.
Finn| You'll be back in a month?! With a new bucket of trash?! It's hot! There's no air in here! I need air! I need air!
Finn| Wha?  Oh! A microphone. There's some dried ketchup on it.  Uh, hello.
Princess Bubblegum| Hi, Finn! You're still asleep after your fight with Susan. But when you wake up, I'm sure you'll have fun discovering everything your new arm can do. And Finn, sincerely, thank you for defending our kingdom again. Oh. Someone else wants to thank you, too.  Thank you, Finn!  I don't know. Okay, um... Welcome, Finn!
Finn| Huh.
Finn| Yes!
Fern| Huh?
Finn| You donked up! 
Fern| Aah!  How did you get out? 
Fern| Hey!
Finn| What do you think you're doing?!
Princess Bubblegum| I'm weed whacking.
Fern| You've been Finn long enough! It's my turn. 
Finn| Fern, smarten up!
Fern|  Nuh-uh!
Finn|  What are you?
Princess Bubblegum| A weed whacker.
Finn| My belzer!
Finn| Fern, if things are going down the way I think they're going down, please tell Jake I love him.
Fern| That doesn't matter. I love him!
Finn| I know you do, Fern. Listen, we can stop this and just go home together. All this lying and fighting, it doesn't have to end like this. Today doesn't have to have this kind of... finality.
Princess Bubblegum|  Fatality!
Jake| Hey, boys! Y'all have fun out there?  Wait, what happened?
BMO|  I know that look. You just killed someone! 
Mysterious individual| Almost done, champ. There you go.  You looking for an uncle?
Pat McHale|  In the dark recesses of the mind, a disease known as FEAR feasts upon the souls who cannot overcome its power...
Finn|  Come back, thief!
Jake|  Whoa!
Fire Newt|  Stop farting on me! It's gross!
Finn|  You can't just go around stealing boots.
Jake|  Yeah, and you know the penalty for stealing boots. It's poots... on newts.
Both|  
Finn|  He's getting away in that lake!
Jake|  Dude, that isn't a lake. That's an ocean.
Finn|   Bark! Bark! Bark! Bark! ...Huh?
Finn|  Uhh...
Jake|   Poots on newts! Poots on newts!
Fire Newt|  No!
Jake|   Poots on newts!
Finn|   I'm coming, Jake. I'll poot on that newt as soon as I'm barefoot. Uh...
Finn|   Ow! Why is my stomach going nuts?
Finn|  Ow!
Finn|  Wh-wh-wh-Who are you?
Fear Feaster|  I am the manifestation of your fear... fear of the ocean!
Finn|  What? I'm not afraid of lakes, wells, or rivers, streams, or deep wells or puddles. Why would I be afraid of- 
Fear Feaster|   'Cause you're a wuss.
Finn|  I'm no wuss! I'm the hero around these parts!
Fear Feaster|  Ha! You're too scared of the ocean to ever be a true hero.
Finn|  Not true! I'm not scared of nothin'!
Finn|   I shall conquer my fear.
Fear Feaster|  Yeah, right.
Finn|  No! I will. I'll conquer my fear.
Fear Feaster|  Of course you will,  and I live in a two bedroom apartment that doesn't smell like vomit  ...Sarcasm.
Jake|  Dude. Dude, did you see me? I was all like womp, and then I was all like take this! Womp! Womp! And then... Hey, what’s wrong with you, dude?
Finn|  Jake. I think I'm afraid... of the ocean.
Jake|  Say what, now?
Finn|  I need your help to overcome my fear. Will you do it?
Jake|  Um... No... I don't really wanna do it.
Finn|  Jake! Come on!
Jake|  I'm just messing with you. I'll do it. Hmm... Where to start? Oh, ok. I think we should just take a few steps in the water. You can hold Jake's hand if you're scared.
Jake|  Um... Oh it's ok, dude. I see the problem. It's just your feet.
Jake|   Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop. Beep. Beep. Boop. Beep. Boop.
Finn|  Don't be scared. I shall not be scared.
Jake|   Boop. Boop.
Finn|  I'm afraid! Ah!  Jake, get me out of the water! Now, Jake! Now! Now!
Jake|  Hot jam! You're really scared of the ocean. In fact, you're so scared... it gives me an idea. Let's start a business of being scared of the ocean!
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|  Ok. Ok. I have a plan to get rid of your fear. We'll start tomorrow morning.
Finn|  But I must conquer this now!  I'm not afraid of you!
Finn|  
Finn|   I'm afraid of you! I'm afraid of you! 
Finn|   Ok, yeah. Let's try tomorrow.
Jake|  Fiiiinn. Finn. Hey, Finn. Wake up.
Finn|   Morning, Jake.
Jake|  Ready for me to help you get over your ocean fear?
Finn|  Yeah, man.
Jake|  Cool... but I can only do this if you ask me.
Finn|  I'm askin'!
Jake|  Then get ready for my three-step plan. Watch your troubles melt away with step one!
Finn|   Jake, are you crazy? This is not an OK thing to do!
Jake|  Hey. Hey. Come on. The ocean is your friend, and you got friends all around you right now. Miles and miles of friends.
Finn|  You're nuts. 
Jake|  Don't try to struggle, man.  I'll let you out in a second. You just need to calm down.
Finn|  Really? Ok. I'm calming down.
Jake|  That's great. You're doing great. Ready for step two?
Finn|   Yeah, man. I can do it.
Jake|  Alright, dude. Step... two! 
Finn|   Jake, this isn't a joke! It's touching me!
Jake|  Let it hold you, man! Let it hold you like a child!
Finn|   I'm trying to let it hold me.
Jake|  Control your breathing!
Finn|   This isn't working!
Jake|  That means we gotta move to step three. Just don't scream.
Finn|  W-what?
Jake|  I'm gonna push you underwater with my jowls. Just don't scream. Don't scream.
Finn|  What?!
Jake|  Don't scream. Hold your breath, Finn. You got it, dude!
Finn|  Get me away, Jake! Now, Jake! Now! Right now! Get-Get me away! 
Jake|  Finn! Stop it, Finn! Ow!
Finn|   I'm safe! I'm safe! How'd I do?
Jake|  I think we should give up.
Finn|  What? I made it all the way to level three.
Jake|  Look, Finn. It's not that I don't want to help you... I just don't wanna get beat up anymore. I mean this  is my bread and butter. I can't have you messing up my bread and butter, dude.
Finn|  You have to help me. I can't do this without you.
Jake|  Ok. Fine... but only if you swear not to hit me anymore.
Finn|  I swear I won't hit you anymore.
Jake|  And also swear to only speak in rhymes. Speak in rhymes all the times.
Finn|  I swear... and pigs have hair.
Jake|  Yes. Perfect. And since you want more... it's time for step four.
Finn|  What? I thought you said it was a three step plan... man.
Jake|  I'm not that good at counting.  Come on. Let's go kick your fear of the ocean where the sun don't shine... in the sea cucumber.
Jake|  Check it, dude. One hundred percent awesome-itude.
Finn|   Yeah. It's pretty math... you psychopath.
Jake|  You know, it looks way more math if you open up your eyes.
Finn|   Whoa...
Jake|  See, man? The ocean is beautiful. There's no reason to be afraid of things that are beautiful.
Finn|  Hey. This isn't that bad. I'm actually glad.
Jake|   Hey, look! A black abyss! Let's go check it out... sauerkraut.
Finn|  No, Jake! Turn around! Turn around!
Finn|  Noooo!
Jake|"  Saying, ""Turn around"" twice doesn't count as a rhyme, dude."
Jake|  Hey, you swore!
Jake|  Ow! My bread and butter!
Jake|  No, dude! Don't!
Jake|  Don't worry, dude. Everything's cool. This is the perfect segue into level five.  Here, put this on.
Jake|  Just make sure you don't pull the emergency tab.
Jake|  No, dude! I said don't...
Finn|  Jake? Jaaaaaake!
Finn|  Jake!
Fear Feaster|   Pathetic! You can't even overcome your fear now that your friend is about to die! Your un-heroic body will never let you save Jake. 
Finn|   You're right.
Fear Feaster|  What? Really? You think I'm right? Well, that's... that's great!
Finn|   If my body won't let me rescue my best friend, then there's only one thing left to do.
Fear Feaster|  No. Wait. No! Noooo!
Finn|  Jake! Jake! Wake up!
Finn|  You ok, dude?
Jake|  Yeah, man. Wait... Finn, you did it! You conquered your fear!
Finn|  What?
Jake|  You're at the bottom of the ocean!
Jake|  Maybe we should celebrate on land.
Jake|  I'm proud of you man. You did it!
Finn|  Thanks, dude.
Fear Feaster|  You've nothing to be proud of, boy! You will never get of your fear of the ocean!
Jake|  Whoa, dude! What's with your bellybutton?
Finn|   What the flip, man? I just swam to the bottom!
Fear Feaster|  No you didn't, cheater! You just sank to the bottom. You will never be a great hero.
Finn|  He's right. I'll never be a hero.
Wise Man 1|  Finn, you are wrong. The mark of a great hero is his flaw.
Fear Feaster|  You know nothing, Wise Men!
Wise Man 1|  Silence, Fear Feaster! We know a lot!
Finn|  Wait... Why did you wait so long to tell me?
Wise Man 1|  Because the limo driver's flaw is being late!
Limo Driver| Sorry. 
Wise Man 1|  Farewell, Finn. You truly are the greatest hero of Ooo.
Finn|  It's time for you to go away, Fear Feaster!
Fear Feaster|  What? Am I supposed to live in your tummy for the rest of my life?
Finn|  Everybody has a flaw... and it looks like yours is smelling like my nasty guts.
Fear Feaster|   Wonderful...
Pat McHale|  And so fear is forced deep within the soul of a hero. Conquered... at least, for now... 
Finn| Thanks, bro!
Jake| There for you, bro... but Finn, I'm gonna tell you something gently.
Finn|  Okay. What is it, bro?
Jake| Get a new sword.
Finn| What you do mean?
Jake| Bro, these guys could've hurt you.
Finn| It still works.  Hyut!
Jake| Bro...
Finn| I love this sword. 
Jake| It'll be okay. Let's go shopping!
Suzy & Sue| Candles! Candles! Candles for all occasions!
Jake| Hey! There's Choose Goose!  Goose! Come on!  Finn? What's wrong?
Finn| Mm, maybe we should try someone else.
Jake| What? But we have history with him—that's important in business.
Finn| Yeah, but we're lookin' for a sword. Remember that armor he sold us? 
Jake|  Ooh. Yeah, okay.
Jake| I asked around. This is the place to get sa-words. 
Finn| Oh. Doesn't look like it's open.
Finn & Jake| Open! 
Voice| Close the curtains behind you, please.
Voice| Walk towards the candle.
Man| How can I help you?
Finn| Need a sword.
Man| Hold on.  Here you go a grass sword. It's a bargain.
Finn| I don't know. I've never used a grass sword before. Maybe we should keep lookin'.
Man| Swords like this don't come around every day.
Finn| Don't come around every day, uh?  I love it.
Jake| Well, that was easy.
Man|  Remember, no take backs.
Jake| Hey, the pillow vendor!
Finn| Huh? Hyut! 
Jake| Huh? Pizza?!
Finn| Yeah! Came outta nowhere! It was gonna bonk you on the head.
Jake| You're getting good with that sword. You were never able to do that with your other swords.
Finn| No more pizza bonks. Hyut!  Hey, we're near Tree Trunks' house. Let's stop by and get some pie.
Jake| Pie!
Finn|  Hyut! Hyut!
Finn| Hyaaaah!♪
Tree Trunks| Howdy, boys! Nice pillow and nice sword. My hands are full, Finn. Uh, you mind slicin' an apple for me? 
Finn| Hyut! 
Tree Trunks| Something is terribly wrong with that awful sword.
Jake| He's gettin' really good. He saved me from pizza.
Tree Trunks| That apple slicing is too perfect... demonically perfect. That sword is cursed!
Jake| I like it when Tree Trunks gets all serious.
Jake| Uh, how's that curse doin'? Makin' you want to moidle me? 
Finn| No, man. This sword doesn't seem to have any curse on it, as far as I can tell.  Hyah!
Jake| Well, okay.  Dang tag.
Finn| I got it!
Jake| Hmm?
Finn| Whoa!
Jake| Hey, quit showin' off, bro!
Finn| Sorry, man. I don't know what happened. I-I... I'll go put this away.
Jake| Good idea. 
Finn|   Huh? 
Finn| What the—? 
Finn|  Jeez.
Finn| Stupid...  thing!  Worst three bucks I've ever spent.
Finn|   Whew.
Jake| What's goin' on?
Finn| The sword is after my flesh!
Jake| Huh?
Jake| Oh, snap!
Finn| Don't let it get me, Jake!
Jake| Don't worry. I'll handle this.  There.
Finn|  Let's go return that junk.
Jake| Huh. Hey, he's not here.
Finn| Hmm. Maybe someone around here knows where he is.
Finn| Somebody in trouble!
Suzy & Sue| Help! They're taking our candles!
Jake| It's the Hooligans Who Love Candles!
Finn| Let's get 'em!  Hey!
Hooligans carrying candle| Huh?
Hooligan| Yo! You got a prob, Bob?
Finn| Stealing candles from old ladies is immoral!  
Another hooligan| Anarchy! 
Finn|  School!  Hyah!
Hooligans| Aah! Stop chasing us!
Hooligan| Happy birthday. 
Hooligan|  You're dead, teddy boy.
Finn| No.
Suzy & Sue| You've saved our shop!
Sue| Thank you so much, you brave young man.
Suzy| And don't even worry about the damages.
Sue| We'll just use the broken pieces to build a life-sized candle in your likeness.
Suzy| Oh, and we'll put it right by the entrance, and it'll be our mascot—the candle man!
Jake| Dude... 
Finn| Yeah... not comin' off.
Jake| Don't give up, man. Hey, maybe Choose Goose knows where the old man went.
Jake| Hey, Choogles! We need your help. We gotta find the dude who sold us this cursed sword. You know who he is?
Choose Goose| I know you did business with some rando guy. Help you backstabbers—Why should I?
Jake| What? Come on, Choogie, it was only one time.
Choose Goose| Hmm.
Finn| I made a mistake, CG. This merch is totally defective.  Please.
Choose Goose| Okay-dokay... I know that quack with the grassy shack. He's a wizard from the grassy plain. He lives atop the grassy moun... tayn.
Jake| Awesome. Wizard of Grassy Moun-tayn... Mountain. Yeah, thanks, Choogs.
Finn| Yeah, thanks!
Choose Goose|  He's the only one who can lift the curse, but beware...
Choose Goose| He's a huge ding-wad—just the worst.
Finn| Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop!
Finn| Hmm. For a cursed dingus, you cut so good.
Finn| Come forth, wizard, and uncurse my mitt! Grassy Mountain Wizard!
Grassy Wizard| Comin' up here tryin' to enter my house! Are you for real?!  Mow 'em down, my cursed grassy objects! 
Finn| Hyah! 
Grassy Wizard| Uh... go forth! Go... uh, forth.  That was all my grassy objects.
Finn|  Lift the curse.
Grassy Wizard|  Never! You have no power over me, young fool! The grass sword will be part of you for all eternity! 
Finn|  Hmm. You know what?  I think I'm cool with that.
Grassy Wizard| What?
Finn| Whoa.  
Jake| Now that you've accepted it, you can control it!
Finn|  Yeah.  This is really cool!  I just had to get used to it. 
Grassy Wizard| That's not how people are supposed to react to an eternal curse!
Finn & Jake| Whatevs.
Jake|  Do it again! 
Finn|  Blah-la-luh. Hey, Jake, give me some of that apple.
Jake|  Coming up.  I know what you're thinking about.
Finn|   Huh?
Jake|  Kissin' Princess Bubblegum on the mouth!
Finn|   No, I'm not! And... I wouldn't even do that ever.
Jake|  Yeah, you would. You're just bad at talking to ladies.
Finn|  Hmmph.  Ehggg-uh-ya-uh. Uh, should I keep going, Mrs. Yoder?
Mrs. Yoder|   No, Finn, that's plenty. Thank you.
Finn|  Okay.  Let us know if you need anything else. Hyah!
Mrs. Yoder|  You two are heroes!
Finn|   Hunh.
Jake|  Come on, dude.
Finn|  Hey! Do you hear that? She called us heroes!
Jake|   Yeah, I heard.
Finn and Jake|  Huh?
Tree Witch|  Hey! How's it going?!  Ugh! Is that true, what the bird said? You guys are heroes?
Finn|  Why were you hiding in that shrub?
Tree Witch|  Oh, I wasn't hiding. I'm a Tree Witch. I can turn into trees and shrubs and bushes and stuff. Check it out.
Jake|   Bleh.
Tree Witch|  So listen, I need you two heroes to get me a lock of princess hair. 
Finn|  Why do you need princess hair?
Tree Witch|  Why? 'Cause I have a balding problem! What, are you, blind?   Are You blind!?
Finn and Jake|  No, we're not blind.  I had no idea... I don't know...
Tree Witch|  Anyway, I need the princess hair so I can put it on my head.  And then I'll be beautiful.
Finn|  Oh, well, uh, we know lots of princesses.
Jake|   Uh, can you, um, give us a minute?
Tree Witch|  Yeah, okay.
Jake|   Dude, I don't think we should help her.
Finn|   Why not?
Jake|  'Cause she's a witch!
Finn|  Maybe she's a good witch.
Jake|  Her? Are you kidding? Come on, look at her!  If she was good, she wouldn't be so ugly.
Tree Witch|  Are you guys still talking?!
Finn|  So what do we do? Tell her we can't help her 'cause she's ugly?
Jake|  No, man! She'll kill us or put a freaky curse on us or something.  Let me get rid of her with some of my world-famous smoove talking.   Hey. Sorry about that, girl.  Ahh. You don't mind if I take a load off, do you?
Tree Witch|  What were you guys talking about?
Jake|  How pretty you are.
Tree Witch|  Huh?
Jake|  We were just saying someone as pretty as you doesn't even need a full head of hair.  Isn't that right, buddy?
Finn|  Uh, yeah, totally!
Tree Witch|  Nuh-unh! 
Jake|  Girl, if I didn't already have a G.F., I'd be on you like butter on toast!
Tree Witch|   I don't mind if you have a G.F.
Jake|  Oh. Umm…
Finn|  Dude, I don't think it's working.
Jake|  Yeah, I think I'm making things worse.
Jake|  Ah-ah-ahhh!
Tree Witch|  Hey.
Jake|  What?
Tree Witch|  How would you... court me?
Jake|  Um... spaghetti dinner?
Tree Witch|  Hmm.
Finn|  Look, Lady, we can't help you get princess hair.
Tree Witch|  Why not?
Finn|  Because... we only help when someone's in danger. 
Tree Witch|  Oh! Well, why didn't you say so?
Jake|  Hey... uh... what's—?! Yaaah! Hey!
Tree Witch|  There. Now someone's in danger.
Jake|  I told you she was evil!
Finn|  Grrrrrr.... Yaah!
Tree Witch|  What, you forget I'm a witch?
Finn|  Maybe.
Tree Witch|  Well, maybe you should get me some princess hair, so maybe your friend doesn't get sucked into my bottomless bottom!
Jake|  Nyuh! Get some princess hair!!
Finn|  All right, fine! 
Tree Witch'|  Wait! Uh, you... you can't tell anyone why you need it.
Finn|  What? Why?
Tree Witch|  I don't want anyone to know I have a balding problem.
Finn|  O...kay. 
Finn|  It's Princess Muscles's castle! 
Muscle Princess|  Hi, Finn.
Finn|  Uh, hey, Princess Muscles.
Muscle Princess|  What brings you by?
Finn|  Um, you were the nearest princess, and I need a lock of your hair.
Muscle Princess|  I understand.
Finn|  You do?
Muscle Princess|  Mm-hmm. 
Finn|  Aah! What are you doing?
Muscle Princess|  Trying to give you a hug.
Finn|  Why? I want hair, not hug!
Muscle Princess|  Oh, I see. You want to take things slo-o-o-w.
Finn|  No! I--I'm here to save you! From your hair! It looks really bad. Cut it off, quick!
Muscle Princess|  Of course it looks bad. If I had beautiful, shiny hair, no one would look at my muscles.  Come back when you wanna get serious about loving me!
Finn|  I am terrible at talking to ladies.
Finn|  Hmm... Where's a princess? Princess?... Princess... Princess... Who's that?  It's Lumpy Space Princess.  Does she... live in the woods now?
Lumpy Space Princess|   G-G-Get away from my camp! I'll cut you! Hrm. I'm never gonna go back home.
Finn|  Huh. Wait. Does she even have hair?  She does! Well... hair is hair.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, my Glob! What the stuff are you doing?! Why are you cutting my lumps?!
Finn|  Because they're, uh... So--
Lumpy Space Princess|   I knew you liked me.
Finn|  No, I don't! I-I'm just stopping by because--
Lumpy Space Princess|  Just admit it, Lover Boy! You can't resist me! Well, if you want these lumps, you gotta put a ring on it! Where's my ring?!  I knew you liked me, Finn. That's why you're running! Get in touch with your feelings, babe!
Finn|"  What am I gonna do? Huh? A graveyard? Yes! There's got to be a hairy princess in there that won't think I'm hitting on her! Princess? Princess? Princess? Ugh! Come on! Bingo!  ""Here lies Princess Beautiful. She was so beautiful."" Hey, that's perfect! And sort of macabre. Oh, well.  Aha! "
Princess Beautiful|  Hi, Finn.
Finn|  Ohh!
Princess Beautiful|  What? What are you -- Please stop.
Finn|  Where's her hair?!
Princess Beautiful|  Thanks, Finn. 
Finn|"  ""Here lies Princess Beautiful. She was so beautiful, but died of baldness?!"" Dang it!"
Tree Witch|   I'm gonna look so beautiful... Invited to all the parties.
Finn|   Jake! Jake! I'm sorry, man. Getting princess hair is -- is impossible! They all just think I'm in love with them! Ugh! I can't do it. You're gonna have to spend the rest of your life in this witch's butt.
Jake|  Noooo!
Tree Witch|  Eh! Quiet down! I'm daydreaming!
Jake|   Dude, if they think you like them, then use that. Embrace it! Find the least terrible princess you can, play her some music, cook her a meal, smoove talk her until she likes you. And then get the hair!
Finn|  Wait. You mean like go on a date?
Jake|  Marry a princess if you need to! Just get her hair! Aaaah!
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|   Go get the hair!
Finn|  Okay! Hold on!
Finn|  Princess Bubblegum!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hi, Finn!
Finn|  Uh... I need you to come with me!
Princess Bubblegum|  Why? I'm watering right now.
Finn|  Just come on. We don't have much time!
Princess Bubblegum|  What is this, Finn?
Finn|  We're gonna have a spaghetti dinner.
Princess Bubblegum|  Whoa! Really? Where do we sit?
Princess Bubblegum|  Um, Finn?
Finn|  Put your butt here! Hurry!
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh. 
Finn|  Hey, Simon, make it romantic.  Oww! Here, shove this in your mouth! It's hot!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, I don't understand--
Finn|  Please, Princess! Just stick it in your mouth!
Princess Bubblegum|  Well, okay.   You're lucky I love spaghetti!
Finn|  Um, Princess... do you like me?
Princess Bubblegum|   Finn, of course I like you.
Finn|  Really?
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeah!
Finn|  Yes! Now give me some of your hair!
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, Finn, that's sweet. Sure, I'll give you some of my hair.  Here. Take it, you cutie.
Finn|  Thank you, Princess Bubblegum!! 
Princess Bubblegum|  My spaghetti!
Tree Witch|"  My cat had kittens... and I'm thinking of naming one ""Little Whiner."" What do you think? Is that a good name?"
Finn|  Totally did it! Genuine princess hair. You hear that, Jake?
Jake|   Just give it to her, already!!
Finn|  All right, lady, a deal is a deal.
Tree Witch|  Ahh! This isn't hair! It's bubblegum!
Jake|  What?!
Finn|  It is bubblegum!
Tree Witch|  Well, I guess you failed. Say goodbye to your dog.
Jake|  Aaaah!
Finn|  WAAIT!
Tree Witch|  What?
Finn|  If I learned anything today, it's that I'm awesome at talking to ladies! And, lady, you are crazy ugly!
Tree Witch|  Wha-a-a-t?
Jake|  Duuuude!
Finn|  Having beautiful hair isn't gonna get you anywhere, because you're ugly, inside and out, so ugly I want to throw up.
Jake|  Duuuude!
Finn|  No one will ever find you beautiful. everrr! And it's got nothing to do with the ol' chrome dome. It has to do with what's in here.  Can you get off my friend now?
Jake|   Du-hu-huuude...
Tree Witch|  He's right.
Jake|  Huh?
Tree Witch|  Well, don't get me wrong. I know I'm ugly. And evil.  But I thought if I had some beautiful hair, I could learn how to love myself.
Finn|  Gee... I feel kind of bad.
Jake|  I don't.
Finn|  Hey, witch! Does it have to be princess hair?
Tree Witch|  No. Just beautiful hair.
Finn|  Well then, check this out!  HA HA-A-A-A-A-A!!!
Tree Witch|  You'd really give me your hair?
Finn|  Sure!
Tree Witch|   So... how do I look?
Finn|  Totally beautiful.  inside and out!
Tree Witch|  Thank you, Finn. And now to use my hair for evil.
Finn|   What?!
Tree Witch|  'Cause I'm evil!!  What did you want from me?  Ohh -- Oh, no. I think I fractured a branch.
BMO|  Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Sick! Sick! So sick! Dying!
Finn| Check it out. I got snacks for while we wait. For Marcy, red lick-rish.
Marceline| Thanks.
Finn| And for BMO... 
BMO|   Fresh boys!
Marceline| So, Finn...  What are we waiting here for?
Finn| What? Dude, it's Super Porp Day.
Jake| Yeah. Don't you know about Super Porp Day?
Marceline|" Wait. ""Super Porp""... like in the old commercials? Uh, let's see, like, ♪Super Porp, it hits the spot, messes up your train of thought. If you're thirsty and out of shape...♪"
Everyone| ♪Get down on that fizzy grape!♪
Finn| Yeah, yeah. That's the one.
Jake| Today's the day when Squeez-E-Mart always gets their monthly shipment.
Marceline| What? That's really weird, guys. Why would s—
BMO| Stop talking! Here it comes!
Cheryl| Enjoy Super Porp!
BMO| I love you, Cheryl.
Marceline| Man, this biz takes me back. I used to drink this stuff all the time when I was a kid.
Finn| What? That's not right. How could the exact same soda still be in production hundreds of years after the great Mushroom Wars?
Jake|  Okay, listen. So, okay, we could go track down the mysterious source of Super Porp. Do up a fuh-real, end up fightin' some big soda-computer-god-baby or whatever... We totally could. But... Super Porp is good. So why question this good thing, man? Why?
Finn| Hmm. Yeah, okay. Let's just go home.
BMO| Yay! Super Porp! Yay! BMO!
Hyoomans|  Super Porp! Super Porp! Super Porp!
Cheryl| Enjoy Super Porp!
Hyoomans| We will, Cheryl!
Susan Strong| No, Cheryl. Susan will not enjoy!
Rabbit Hyooman| Chill out, Susan Strong.
Giraffe Hyooman| Yeah. Super Porp taste good! Super Porp is good!
Susan Strong| No. It fake juice. Tough-guy hyoomans do not drink fake juice.
Susan| Hmph.  Go away, robots!
Mother|  Baby? Baby!
Susan Strong| Eh?! Baby!  Baby!
Susan| Baby.
Susan|  Oh, dang! 
Susan| Baby.
Celina| Porp fountain.
Susan| Hmm?
Susan| Hmm?   Cheryl.  Where's baby? Cheryl better talk. 
Cheryl| Hello, and welcome to the original Super Porp factory!  Are you ready to get porrrped? I-I-I think we all need to get poooorped.
Susan|  Baby!
Celina| Susan killed Cheryl!
Susan|  No!  This is fake style bubblehead. Cheryl trying to trick us!
Susan|  Baby! That hole too small for Susan.
Susan| If Sally say so...  Hup! Hyah!
Susan| You two, follow baby cries.
Susan| Susan will find other way. Hmm?  Hmm... 
Workers| ♪Super Porp, it hits the spot. It messes up your train of thought. If you're thirsty and out of shape, get down on that fizzy grape! Super Porp!♪
Susan| Uh.
Female Worker| Hey! No one is allowed to taste pure Porp syrup! You know this, Carla.
Carla| But it looks sooo good!
Female Worker| Well, of course it does! I mean, I'd smash everyone's face in this room for a single drop of pure Porp, but that's not the Super Porp way.
Female Worker| Aw, cheer up, girl. Maybe we'll get bonus reg Porp after that new baby gets processed.
Susan| Baby!
Male Worker| Hey, where's your hairnet?!
Male Worker| Ow! W-w-where's your hairnet? Where's your hairnet?

Cheryl| Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh.  Hey. How's it going?
Celina| Cheryl?
Susan| Susan hates Cheryl!
Cheryl| So... you're the dinguses who trashed my facility.
Susan| Yes. Susan is the dingus. Now gimme the baby!
Cheryl| Oh, I see. You don't understand what's going on. This is a super spesh baby, a destiny baby, selected by my loyal delivery drones to take my place as high mascot Cheryl.  For you see—
Susan| Don't drink that.
Cheryl|   Good job, bozo. Without a new Cheryl, brand awareness will go straight down the toilet. Our in-your-face flavor will be lost forever. Who are you to condemn our weird ancient ways? 
Susan| Stop!
Worker| Cheryl?
Susan| Yes, I am Cheryl. 
Workers| Huh?
Susan| And Cheryl says this is what we do now. Back to work! Everybody, destroy the factory!
Workers| Destroy the factory. Back to work. Destroy the factory. Back to work.
Jake| Alright, well, it's one month later. Aw, yeah! Here it comes!
Cheryl| Enjoy Super Porp!
Jake| Ugh! I jinxed it! 
Bear|  Dark times are coming.
Old Lady|  You talk like justice, Billy,  but you can't kick a plaaaaaannnne.
Finn|   AHHHH!!!!!  Whoa!!!!!!!!
Jake|  You alright, buddy? Another nightmare?
Finn|  Yeah. That dang snail again, man... Muckin' it up again. But... there were other guys this time, too. The bear was there, and some dogs, and Billy's lady, and Billy... and Billy was real scared of somethin' fierce, man. Somethin' real fierce! ...And the Cosmic Owl was there, too—kinda—screechin' it up.
Jake|  Whoa, the Cosmic Owl? What if that was a premonition dream, Finn?
Finn|  You think?
Jake|  Could be... We better go tell Billy about it just in case. He'll know what to do.
Finn|  Dang... Whoa...
Jake|  I dreamed I was in kindergarten again, but I had really big feet and was also the teacher.
Jake|  Come on! We better hurry!
Finn|  Hello?  Billy?? 
Jake|  BILLY!!! WAKE UP!!!!
Billy|  Huh!? WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU GUYS DOIN IN MY CRACK?! It's THREE O' CLOCK IN THE MORNING!
Finn|  Oh, you know, just drop by to say hello... See what you been uhhhhhh  up to? What Uhhhh...How are these days?
Jake|  We came to see if you were dead!
Billy|  What? Why would I be dead?!
Finn|  Hehehehe... Yeah..... Stupid.... Um....? I had a dream about a bear, and an old lady, and a snail, and you were there, and the snail killed you... or something...
Billy|  Was the Cosmic Owl there?
Finn|  Uhhh... Yeah! On TV! Does that count?
Billy|  Your dream is an ill omen of GRAVE significance.
Billy|  Finn?
Finn|  Yeah?
Billy|  Are you ready to come with me on a mission to save all life from the Lich?
Finn|  Yes.
Finn|  Wait... So... We have to snatch gems out of all the crowns of power?
Billy|  That's right.
Jake|   Cool!
Finn|  Why do we have to snatch them? Can't we just ask them for 'em?
Billy|  No time. The fate of the world hangs in the balance.
Finn|  Oh yeah... I forgot.
Jake|  You sure that's a gem?
Finn|  I think so...
Finn|   So deep...
Jake|  Gross....
Jake|  Man, we got so many gems, it's crazy! Hey Billy, how many gems we still need to get? Two? One?
Jake|  Wait... Two? Or One?
Jake|  Hmm...
Finn|  I want candy!  You got anything in the saddlebag?
Billy|  GET OUT OF THERE!
Finn|  The Enchiridion? How'd ya get this?!
Billy|  I found it in the mouth of a bear.
Finn|  A bear?
Billy|  This book is REALLY important It has magical powers. Turn the little sword sideways.
Finn|  WHOA!
Jake|   Ooooooohhhhhhh!
Billy|  Exhibio Carnotum! 
Finn|  Whoa!
Jake|  Cool!
Finn|  What is this this stuff?
Billy|  Hold on!
Booko|   Hello, my name is Booko! What you see here is a map of the multiverse! It shows all the known dimensions and the links between each of them. This is the dimension that contains the universe in which we currently reside.
Jake|  Enhance!
Jake|  Whoa... Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm...MAKE IT STOP!
Booko|  Anyways, At the center of the multiverse is a dimension called the Time Room, believed to be the quasi-corporeal dwelling place of the almighty Prismo. The Time Room is the single dimension that exists outside of time. The Time Room produces time waves that are experienced by other dimensions. Some dimensions have permanent links that allow travel to and from. Others become linked temporarily by naturally forming Worm Holes. And others can become linked artificially by magical portals, torn open by items of great power. Once the last gem is inserted into the Enchiridion it will have the power to create a portal to any dimension in the multiverse. An activated portal creates a time dilation in which either end of the portal experiences a temporal synchronization allowing for the safe passage of particles  through a non-local region of space-time.
Billy|  I'm going to push the Lich in there 
Finn|  Whoa... Cool!
Jake|  Let's go get that gem!
Finn|  Yeah!
Little Candy Person|  Hi!

Jake| Hmm. I know what'll fix you up girl's night out, boy style! First, we'll go to the salon, get yo hair did and your nails all—wait, no. First, we'll go to the shops, get you a brand new hat. Then, we'll—   A burgler-mer!
Finn, Jake, & Ice King| Aah!
Finn & Jake| The Ice King? Grr—eh! 
Ice King| Jeez, you couldn't wait two seconds?
Finn|  Ech.   Why are you stinkin' up our house?
Ice King| Didn't you get my text? It said I'm stayin'  with you guys— oh, didn't go through. Well, anyways, I knew you wouldn't mind since it's sorta your fault I'm homeless, right?
Finn| Right.
Ice King| 'Cause you tricked your crazy ex into meltin' my Ice Kingdom?
Finn| Mmhm.
Ice King| With your lies and secrets? 'Member when that happened?
Jake| Dude, you can't stay here if you're gonna stank it up with your bad vibes, man!
Ice King| Yeah, I'm just crashing here while the penguins rebuild. I've given Gunter temporary reign.
Ice King| Should be fine.
Finn| Flame Princess isn't crazy.
Ice King| You're blind, Finn. You're blind—wait, she isn't here, is she?
Finn| No.
Ice King| Whew!
Finn| She said she wanted time to herself. 
Ice King| Yeesh.
Jake| Yeah, breakups are tough.
Ice King| Heh, yeah, like, remember how you and I were married?
Flame Princess| Uh! It's so confusing!
Flame Princess| Hmm?  I thought Finn was a stand-up guy, you know? But he basically betrayed me.
Flame Princess| Why do people even have secrets?
Flame Princess| It's like that in the Fire Kingdom, too. Everyone is all deceitful and Shakespeare. But out here doesn't seem any different.  Why do I have to feel like this?  And what is that noise?! Grrr!
Princess Bubblegum| Eh.
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeah, yeah. Just act like I'm not here.
Flame Princess|  Are you spying on me?!
Princess Bubblegum| What?! No, of course not!
Princess Bubblegum| I was observing you—for research.  You're a threat, Flame Princess. Your emotions are directly linked to your combustion levels. But if I can create a scientific model that describes your complete elemental matrix, I can isolate and suppress your more... volatile traits.
Flame Princess| So, if you do your research, you'll know how to cut off my emotions so I won't feel like this?
Princess Bubblegum| Umm, yeah, basically!
Flame Princess| Then I'll help you.
Princess Bubblegum| You will?
Flame Princess| Yes. I'll do whatever it takes.
Princess Bubblegum|  Once I press this button, you'll be subjected to a battery of tests to gauge your reflexes, stamina, and your reaction to various emotional stimuli.
Flame Princess| This is going to help me understand myself?
Princess Bubblegum| There's a 40% chance we'll be able to identify and isolate your chemical components—and yes, understand you in a very scientific way.
Flame Princess| Oh. That's good... I guess.
Princess Bubblegum| Initiate test.  Yah.  Hello?
Jake| Princess! We need you and your Ball Blam Burglerber right away! Gunter has created a race of strangling snow snakes, or snow-a-constrictors!
Jake|  Aaaah—
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, Cinnamon Bun, all you have to do is write down the numbers that appear on this monitor. Can you do that one thing?
Cinnamon Bun| Yes.
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, one other thing. Do not open that door.  So that's two things write down the numbers, do not open that door. Got it?
Cinnamon Bun| Yes, Princess.
Cinnamon Bun|  Hello.
Flame Princess| Hello.
Cinnamon Bun| You look sad.
Flame Princess| Yeah, but mostly I'm confused.
Cinnamon Bun| Ha, me too.
Flame Princess| Really?
Cinnamon Bun| Yeah. Bubblegum is bad.
Flame Princess| She is?!
Cinnamon Bun| I don't know. Wanna pet my dog?! He lives at my house.
Flame Princess| What about the tests?
Cinnamon Bun| I'm not good at tests.
Cinnamon Bun| La-de-da-de-da  His name is Jake, but he's not the real Jake.  Ow. My body is soft. 
Cinnamon Bun|   We're friends.
Flame Princess| Yeah, I really get you, but sometimes friends are hard to understand. Sometimes you think you know them, but you find out they're just playing mind games.
Cinnamon Bun| Is the princess your friend?
Flame Princess| I don't know.
Cinnamon Bun| Yeah, because why did she lock you up in jail when you were a little baby? That was a weird friend thing.
Messenger| The word! The word!
Flame King| What's the word?
Messenger| The word is your newborn baby will have greater powers than you'll ever dream of.
Flame King| Uh... have my baby sent into the wilderness of the outside world to perish.
Messenger| Okay! 
Messenger| Oop. Hup. 
Messenger| Ah!  Aw.  
Flame Princess|   
Messenger|  Hmm. 
Rock Woodsman| Ho-ho! 
Rock Woodsman|  WAAAAAAAAAH!
Flame Princess|   Bah.  Ca'tle.
Princess Bubblegum|  What's this?
Flame Princess| Kih, kih.
Princess Bubblegum| A princess? Must've wandered off.
Princess Bubblegum| Flame King?
Flame King| What do you want, princess of the Gum World?
Princess Bubblegum| I found your lost daughter.
Flame King| I-I don't remember losing anything.
Princess Bubblegum| Pssh.
Flame King| Okay, you got me. I had her sent to wander in the woods. I was in fear of being usurped. Come on.
Princess Bubblegum| That's your problem, but you can't just let her run around the woods. She's too dangerous. Find some way to contain her power, or I will.
Flame King| Pssh, fine.
Flame Princess|   Is everybody in this world hiding something?
Cinnamon Bun| It's fun to hide.
Flame Princess| You're all right. Why can't everybody be honest like you? Maybe I should just go back where I belong.
Cinnamon Bun| Wait, do you mean baby jail?
Flame Princess| I don't know, man.
Cinnamon Bun| Mmmm...
Finn| Fighting snow-a-constrictors really helped take my mind off things.
Finn| So, uh, why am I here again?
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, I just wanted to measure Flame Princess's reaction when confronted by the guy who broke her heart.
Princess Bubblegum| Hey, Cinnamon Bun, I'm—
Princess Bubblegum| CINNAMON BUN!!!
Princess Bubblegum|" There's a note  ""Gon 2 fyr kingdum. Pleez watch dog."""
Finn| Oh, this is terrible! If Flame Princess goes back there, her evil dad will lock her up again!
Princess Bubblegum|  And if she's imprisoned, I won't be able to complete my tests, and I'll have wasted my precious time!
Finn| We gotta save her. Let's doogie!
Flame Guard #1| State your business here, and be quick about it. Sorry, I'm on edge 'cause I'm worried that Jerry here will find out I'm dating his sister.
Finn| Listen, we need to get into the castle right now.
Flame Guard #1| Yeah, but why?
Finn| Grrr! So I can go to your mama's house! Now get outta my way!
Jerry| Doesn't your mom live in a nursing home?
Flame Guard #1| Yeah, and in a different city. C'mon, dude, you gotta be honest here.
Finn| Honest my fist!  Come on, Princess!
Flame Guard #2| D'aw, yeah! Gonna scramble you and fry you up for brunch! I try to act tough but I really wanted to be a chef.
Finn| Man.
Jerry| Halt. What is your business here?
Flame Person| I need to get inside to file my taxes. Also I like using the bathroom here. Also I like to crop dust the lobby.
Flame Guard #2| Pass, friend.
Finn| Alright, so you wanna get nasty? One time, I blew a snot bubble that broke off and floated away. Then it hit some lady's baby in the face, and it started crying.
Princess Bubblegum| And I really enjoy the taste of envelopes.
Flame Guard #1| Uh, that's cool and all, but you still haven't told us why you want to get in.
Princess Bubblegum| We need to see the king?
Flame Guard #1| Well, why didn't you just say so? Right this way, friends.  There you go  the new Flame King.
Finn| Flame Princess?
Flame Princess| Finn?
Finn| You're okay! Um, how's it going?
Flame Princess| Pretty good. Cinnamon Bun and I staged a coup and I overthrew my dad.
Princess Bubblegum| Oh-ho, that's why the guards were wigging out.
Flame Princess| That is the new way in the Fire Kingdom. Total honesty is the law of the land—no secrets.
Finn| Oh.
Flame King|  Right, can you believe this nonsense? Once I get outta here, I'm gonna ground you for real. No snacks, no friends, no popular music.
Flame Princess| You never let me have any of those things! You were a selfish king and a bad parent!
Flame King| But I did it for you, honey—for you not to overthrow me like you just did.
Flame Princess| You belong in that lamp! And if you don't settle down, you'll have to answer to Cinnamon Bun!
Cinnamon Bun|  Hi.
Finn| Wow. She's even awesomer than I remember.
Princess Bubblegum| Take off that silly hat. We're going home.
Cinnamon Bun| No. Look,  got a real dog now! Hah.
Finn| Flame Princess, listen. I'm really sorry I lied and hurt your feelings, and I was a big fat jerk—
Flame Princess| Finn, it's okay. It's in the past now.
Finn| So, does that mean we're still going out?
Flame Princess| No. I've realized my place is here, ruling these weak and vicious Fire People.
Finn| I see. 
Flame Princess| But we're cool. You're welcome to come back and hang out whenever you like if you promise me one thing.
Finn|  Anything.
Flame Princess| That you'll be completely honest with me.
Finn| Heh. Okay. I promise.
Flame Princess|  I'm serious.
Finn| Hmm.
Finn|  What's up?
Flame Princess|  Nothing, I don't know.
Jake|  If anybody wants tea, it will be ready in a few minutes.
Flame King|  Evil...evil...evil...evil...evil!
Jake|  Whoa, Flame King!
Flame Princess|  Father!
Flame King|  Oh, well, uh... Sorry, I... thought my daughter was alone... Well, I'll just be going now. Nice teapot.
Jake|  Ooh!
Finn|  What was that?
Jake|"  He was saying ""evil, evil, evil"" over and over again."
Finn|  Yeah, I heard.
Jake|  Well, I wasn't sure if you heard him 'cause he was whispering.
Finn|  Yeah, I heard. 
Flame Princess|  Ugh, he's so annoying.
Jake|  Well, I was just trying to help.
Flame Princess|  Oh, not you, Jake, my dad. I always catch him whispering stuff in my ear while I'm not paying attention. He keeps saying I'm evil.
Finn|  Whoa, you best not be believing that whack bunk. I bet he's trying to make your life bad, so you'll think you're evil. But you're really not!
Flame Princess|  How can I know for sure?
Finn|  Dungeons.
Flame Princess|  What?
Finn|  Let's have a good time in a dungeon or something, that always clears my head that reminds me what's what.
Flame Princess|  And that will make me good?
Finn|  No, that will show you not to worry so much, because you're already good in here.
Flame Princess|  Ok, yeah, let's do it.
Finn|  Dungeons!
Flame Princess|  Dungeons!
Jake|  Chamomile tea!
Flame Princess|  Is this how you look for a dungeon?
Finn|  Yeah... a lot of times the entrances are hidden, so you gotta look under rocks and stuff for a secret switch.
Finn|  Sometimes it takes a while... Hmm.
Flame Princess|  I'll just use my heat sense.
Flame Princess|  That tree over there is not made of wood.
Finn|  Really?
Finn|  Yes!
Finn|  Ooh... gauntlet.
Flame Princess|  Thanks for taking me out Finn.
Finn|  No prob, Bob, light this for me, will ya? 
Flame Princess|  Oh, sure. Um... do we need a torch? I'm sort of made of fire.
Finn|  Oh...well, I guess torches are just cool for dungeons, you know?
Flame Princess|  Oh, okay.
Finn|  Yeah...I like to hang on to it.
Flame Princess|  Boy, this place is creepy!
Finn|  Really? I feel like it's trying too hard. Gold piece! 
Flame Princess|  Oh, you mean, like, with all the skulls? 
Finn|  Whoa! Whoa!
Flame Princess|  What?
Boney|  Hey! What are you doing here?
Flame Princess|  Burning you alive!
Finn|  Haha no, no, wait a sec. Sorry, one second.
Boney|  Sure.
Finn|  He might have an important loot on him, so we don't wanna just burn him up; plus it's a little cruel even for an evil guy, check this out.  RRRAAA, you're gonna surrender!
Boney|  Okay, okay, I surrender!!!
Finn|  I shall grant thee clemency! If you do the splits! Do the splits!
Boney|  I-I can't-I can't do the splits.
Finn|  Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie!
Boney|  Okay, okay...Ow, ow, ow! 
Finn|  See, a lot of times you can overpower these guys with confidence.
Flame Princess|  Neat!
Finn|  Got any loot on ya?
Boney|  Just this map. It'll-it'll help you.
Finn|  Ha! See? This would've been burned!
Flame Princess|  Yeah, no, that makes sense.
Finn|  What else you got?!
Boney|  Yeah! Uh, uh, there's a treasure chest in the corner, please stop yelling.
Finn|  Hah, hah! I knew it.  Oh, cram it to the butternuts, it's locked!
Boney|  Aahh! I don't know were the keys is, please don't yell!
Finn|  Hahaha, alright. We can come back to that later.  Hey, are you having fun?
Flame Princess|  Mhm.
Boney|  I- I'll just stay here.
Flame Princess|   Race you to the next monster!
Finn|  WHOA, whoa!
Flame Princess|  What?
Finn|   That's not how you do things in a dungeon. You gotta sneak.
Flame Princess|  Sneak?
Finn|  Like this.  And you gotta look around.  
Finn|   Ok, this guy's too big to intimidate, but I have a plan. First, you shoot some fire at that rope, the chandelier falls, we distract the monster and we run in. Element surprise.
Flame Princess|   Wow.
Finn|  You ready?
Flame Princess|  Yeah.
Finn|   Before we go in, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire?
Flame Princess|  Uhh... what?
Finn|  Like on a scale of 1 to 100, how good are you at quietly throwing a tiny bit of fire at a rope 50 feet away?
Flame Princess|  Uhh...
Finn|  Scale of 1 to 100.
Flame Princess|   42.
Finn|   42?!
Flame Princess|   Well, I don't know! I've never rated myself before.
Finn|   Well, that's cool, that's cool. Just try to hit that rope.
Flame Princess|  Are you okay?
Finn|  Yeah, I'm good. it's a hologram.
Flame Princess|  Oh. Neat. So, uhh, should we keep going?
Finn|  Yeah, although it does raise the question. Why would someone go through the trouble of setting up a hologram? Unless... they've hidden something in this room? 
Finn|   Hey, wake up.
Flame Princess|  I was meditating. 
Finn|  Look what I found. 
Flame Princess|  A key!
Flame Princess|  We have to go back?
Finn|  We don't have to, we get to! Come on. 
Finn|  See? That didn't take long at all. Now we get treasure.
Flame Princess|  Okay.
Finn|   Nope. This key's for something else. Haha. Oh, well. 
Flame Princess|   Jeez. This is kinda boring. At least he's walking fast.
Finn|  See? That's where I found the key.
Finn|  Snapdragons!!
Snapdragon|  Take my place, take my place! Take my- 
Flame Princess|  Scatter fire! 
Finn|  No, no, we shake them down first, remember?
Flame Princess|  He... wanted me to take his place.
Finn|   Man. Ooh, hold on.  Ha ha! It's another key! Now we get to go back to the beginning!  Whoohoo!
Flame Princess|  Finn, I'm not having any fun.
Finn|   What? Why?
Flame Princess|  Well, you keep wanting me to do things your way. But I don't like doing things your way. Is that because I am evil?
Finn|  What? No, wait, that's... no! Uhh, hey, you know what? Let's do things your way.
Flame Princess|  Really?
Finn|  Yeah. I've been acting an uncouth lout, m'lady.  Okay, so there's a door over there. What do you wanna do?
Flame Princess|  I... burn it down. 
Finn|  Okay, that worked. Now what do you do...
Flame Princess|   RRAAAAAGGGHHH!!
Finn|  Uhh...  Good- good job, FP.
Flame Princess|  Thanks, FTH! Haa!  Ughh, doors! Burn, burn, burn!  Huh? Ugh.
Finn|  Oh, Sham man. It's the legion of Goo Skulls! Uh, how do you defend?
Flame Princess|  Uhh... snake fire!! 
Finn|  Fire burn goo.
Flame Princess|  Yes! Feel my flames, puny worms!  The power of destruction!
Finn|  Woh.   Whoa! Flame Princess!!
Flame Princess|  Huh? 
Finn|  Ahh!!!
Finn|   Help me! But don't use fire because you'll- mphh! 
Flame Princess|  Release him or feel the wrath of the Princess of Flames!
Flame Princess|  Very well.
Flame Princess|   Do the splits! Do the splits, thou milk-livered maggot pie!   
Finn|  Hot Daniel! Flame Princess. I thought you were going to burn me alive.
Flame Princess|  No way! I'd never do that to my boyfriend. 
Flame Princess|  Ha, thanks Finn. That was a really awesome experience.
Finn|  Dungeons totes clear your head, right?
Flame Princess|   I forget how good it feels to destroy stuff.
Finn|   Uhhhh.....
Flame Princess|  I mean, like evil stuff.
Finn|  Oh yeah, cool.
Flame Princess|  We should go again sometimes. Do you know any other dungeons?
Finn|  Maybe next time we should just go to like... a farmer's market.
Flame Princess|  And burn it.
Finn|  Hmm, try this key.
Finn|  What is it?
Finn & Jake| Willy! Willy! Oh, Willy!
Princess Bubblegum| Sh! There it is. The weeping Willy.  One drop of its rare sap can flavor an entire stock pot of soup.
Clone James|  Danger, danger! Whoop whoop! Loose gravel!
Princess Bubblegum| James?
Clone James| Look out princess!  Poot poot poot shooh!
Princess Bubblegum|   Ow!
Clone James|  
Princess Bubblegum, Finn & Jake|   James!
Clone James| Remember me! 
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, not this again.
Time card| 3 months ago
James| I'm registering mondo mega rads down there.
Finn| Huh?  Oh, my garf! What are they?!
Princess Bubblegum| They're toxic creatures, from another time.
Jake|  It can't end like this.
Finn|  James!
Finn| I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me?
Princess Bubblegum| Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others.
Princess Bubblegum| And even though he is gone, and it's super sad, I would like to honor James… With this new James I whipped up in the lab!
Clone James| Jeet!
Princess Bubblegum| Here you go, James—  an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James! 
Finn| Wow. James sacrificed his life for you again, PB.
Jake| Yeah, that's like the twenty-fifth time, right?
Finn| Yeah, obviously we'll have to re-clone him.
Jake| Totes.
Princess Bubblegum| Now hold up. This ground is perfectly solid.  There's no loose gravel here.
Jake| So what? Clone him up, girl.
Princess Bubblegum| James is too reckless. I can't reward this kind of foolish behavior forever. It's time James takes his eternal nap.
Finn| But it's James!
Jake| Come P-Gum, don't be all cold-hearty!
Princess Bubblegum| I'm putting my foot down. There will be no more Jameses.
Finn| No...
Princess Bubblegum| I'm sorry. Look, I need you guys to go to James's apartment and box up his stuff.
Jake|  And remember the time James saved PB from that contaminated cupcake?
Finn| Yeah, he ate that whole cupcake. What a guy...
Finn|  Is this... James heaven?
Jake|  Jameses!  Alright, who's in charge here?
Finn| James...
James II| Uh, I'm James number 2. The original James got all goopy in the desert.
Jake| Explain this biz, James II.
James II| Well... I was lonely! I knew Princess Bubs would make a new James if, you know, a James died a hero. So...
Finn| You faked your own death?
James II| Yeah! I just wanted a friend.  Someone who gets me!
Finn| James...
James II| Plus, each time I get kerplonked, I get another shiny medal, and why have two medals if you can have all the medals? Medals, medals, medals...
Finn| Dude, I've been to your funeral like twenty-five times.
James II| What? The medals make me happy. Plus, PLUS! It's a constant party here in  Jamestown!
Jake|  PB ain't gonna like this.
Finn| Hmm hmm!
James II| Wait, don't tell her! I'll give you a medal.
Jake| Nah, man. PB's no dummy. She'll find out. It's only a matter of time.
Finn| We like you James but, you're on your own. We're gonna sit this one out.
Finn| This should be good.
Jake| There's Princess Bubblegum!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey! Stop running! You rascals, get back here! You are all in so much trouble!  James!
Jake|  What a show!
Finn| Very enjoyable!
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, who's the Banana Guard Leader for this week?
Banana Guard Leader| I'm the leader.
Princess Bubblegum| This picture should help you find the Jameses.
Banana Guard Leader| Hey guys, it's the picture of one of the perpetrators. Take a good look.
Banana Guards| Ooooh!
Princess Bubblegum| There's twenty-five of them.
Banana Guard Leader| I need to see the other twenty-four pictures.
Princess Bubblegum| Nope, you only need that one.
Banana Guard Leader| What? How can one picture identify twenty-five perpetrators?
Princess Bubblegum| It's because they all look the same.
Banana Guard Leader| Oh okay, I see. There's twenty-five of them! They all look like this guy!
Banana Guard I| Huh, how can twenty-five guys look like one guy? You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?
Banana Guard Leader| You mean they're viginti-quintuplets?
Princess Bubblegum| No! They're clones.
Banana Guard Leader| What are clones?
Princess Bubblegum|  A group of organisms or cells produced asexually from one ancestor or stock, to which they are genetically identical.
Banana Guard II| How did that happen?
Princess Bubblegum| It's a long story.
Banana Guard Leader| I love long stories.
Princess Bubblegum| Aaah! There's no time!
Banana Guard Leader| And they're not brothers?
Princess Bubblegum| No! They're not brothers, they're clones!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey! Get down here and help me!  Viginti-quintuplets! I'm telling you...
Princess Bubblegum| What are you doing? Why aren't you helping?
Jake| Come on PBs, just sit here with us for five minutes.
Princess Bubblegum| Why?
Jake| Come on! Five minutes!
Princess Bubblegum| Maybe just a brick.
Banana Guard Leader|  Hey you, stop!
Clone James I| Yeah?
Banana Guard Leader| Have you seen this guy?
Clone James I| Hmm...
Princess Bubblegum|  I have to admit, it's fun to watch.
Banana Guard Leader|  You two stop too!  Show them the picture!
Clone James I| Alright.
Banana Guard Leader| Have you guys seen this guy?
Clone James II&III| Hmm...
Banana Guard Leader| Let me see that picture again.
Clone James I|  Here you go.
Banana Guard Leader| Hmm... Hmm...  What's your name?
Clone James I| James.
Banana Guard Leader|  What's your name?
Clone James IV| James.
Clone James V|  James.
Clone James VI|  James.
Banana Guard Leader| You're all named James. Is it because you guys look alike?
Clone James VI| I guess so.
Banana Guard Leader| Y'know, I was telling this to the guys... If, if we look alike, we should have the same name. It would just make it a little easier. Life, that is. It would make our life a little easier.  Aah... Give me a second...  Same name... Look alike... You really look alike... Brothers! You're all brothers?
Clone James VI| No... I don't think so.
Banana Guard Leader|  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-
Clone James VI| Twenty-five. If you're counting how many of us look alike, there's twenty-five.
Banana Guard Leader| Hmm... Twenty-five... Not brothers...   I think these are the twenty-five that are not brothers.  Perpetrators! Get to them! 
Banana Guard II|  Where they'd go?
The four Banana Guards|  It's them!
The four Jameses| Whoop whoop!
Banana Guards| Gotcha!
Jameses| Aww!
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, fun's over. You're not heroes!  You don't deserve these medals.
James II| Wah, no fair.
Gumball Guardian| Evil presence detected! Evil! 
Princess Bubblegum| Protect the kingdom!
Banana Guards| Okay! Weeoo weeoo weeoo weeoo...  Ah! Can't fight! 
Finn| Yoink!
Banana Guard| Hey!
Finn| Heeyah!Aww! Don't touch the monsters! They'll melt you! Oh my jerbs! Jake! Let's help these candy orphans!  Hey kids! 
Gumball Guardian| Evil! 
James II| Man, we do deserve them medals. It's not like she can give them to someone else. I wrote my name on all of them.
Clone James| Yeah, so did I. 
James II| Princess!
Princess Bubblegum|  The original James?
James II| James are a heroes! See?  Vrow-w-w-w!
Clone James| Yeah, I'm-a save the day! 
Clone James| I, as well! 
Clone James| For the good of the many! 
Clone James| Check out my selfless act! 
Clone James| Me, too! So selfless! 
Clone James| All for one, and one for James! 
Jake| Mother of Grob!
Jameses| We told you we were heroes!
Princess Bubblegum| I hereby award thee...Jameses...These medals for bravery.
Finn| Dat's my boi, Jameses!
Princess Bubblegum| Now for your new assignment, Jameses. Go unto the Wastelands, and never come back.
Clone James| What-a-wha...?
Princess Bubblegum| Do it, and I'll send you a medal every day.
Jameses| Yay!
Clone James| Come on, every-James!
Jameses|  Medals! Medals! Medals! Medals! Medals!
Princess Bubblegum|   I'm not gonna miss him.
Finn|" When we catch that bandit, I'm gonna be like Then I'm gonna give him just a wicked noogie, then a lecture on personal responsibility. Then another noogie, like, ""Get that knowledge in there."
Jake| Yeah, dude, but it's getting pretty late. We might got to catch him tomorrow.
Finn| Aww. What do you think, Finn Sword? Should we stay out a little longer?  Should we do a sword trick? Is that a better idea? 
Jake| No looking.  I bet you can't do that behind your back.
Finn| Like this?  Sword trick! 
Jake| What a sword trick.
Finn| Finn Sword, are you just loving this? 
Jake| Oh, oh! I bet you can't do that and freestyle some bars.
Finn| I can do that! Hyup!  It's the boy I-I'm a boy Whoa! Aah!  Finn Sword! 
Peppermint Butler| Swordsmith Deity, from your unseen throne, bless this sword with your mighty hone! This new sword is guaranteed to defend you against Princess Bubblegum's heinous family. Uncle Gumbald!
Peppermint Butler| Aunt Lolly!
Peppermint Butler| Cousin Chicle!
Jake| I like your swordsmith hat.
Jake| Am I your special guest?
Peppermint Butler| No.
Jake| Dang.
Peppermint Butler| This sword will serve you much better than your old, cursed Grass Sword. This sword is also cursed, but it has a compass in the hilt!
Finn| Neat!
Peppermint Butler| Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum!
Finn| Hunson Abadeer!
Hunson| Finn the Human! And Jake the Dog! Hey, did Marceline call me-?
Peppermint Butler| It is I who summoned you. I humbly ask you for an infusion of Nightosphere magic upon this sword.
Hunson| Okay.
Peppermint Butler|" I proclaim this blade  ""The Night Sword""! Now to send you back."
Hunson| Not so fast. It's like I got a free flight here. I'm gonna go see my little girl.
Finn| Back in the hole, Marceline's dad.
Hunson| I'll behave myself. No soul sucking, no evil stuff. I'm trying to be a better person. Maybe it's too late for me, but I'm trying. Oh, I'm so ashamed of the things I've done! 
Peppermint Butler| Have some dignity, man! All right. You may leave the circle for one day.
Hunson| Wheeeeee! Ha-ha-ha-ha! Time to suck some souls! 
Hunson| Hey, what gives?
Peppermint Butler| Phantom manacles your wrists shall constrain until you're back in your hole again! Finn.
Finn| Let's go see Marcy.
Jake| Great sword making, Pep But.
Peppermint Butler| Yo, see you guys at the concert!
Hunson|   Walkin' in ooo, not suckin' out souls Walk, walk, walk, not suck, suck, suck Walk, walk, walk, not suck, suck, suck.
Finn| Hey, could you stop saying that, please?
Hunson| So what's my little monster up to these days? Is she still all goody-goody? Still half-vampire? Started dating anyone?
Finn| Yes, yes, but no, then yes again, and maybe? Look, maybe cool it with the prying around Marceline.
Hunson| Nah, she loves it when I pry.
Chicle|  Oh, Chicle, have you finally discovered the vampire girl's weakness? I think sooo. Chuckling mode off.
Hunson|  You know, now that we're here, I'm having second thoughts. It just seems like no matter what I do, I always tick that girl off.
Hunson|  Marceline! Long time no see. Some googoo with glasses summoned me. What's that thing? Just gonna put this here, okay? Now let's go suck some souls!
Hunson|  I don't know what it is.
Jake|  Uhh, heh.
Finn|  Psst-psst .
Marceline| Dad, what are you doing here?
Hunson| I'm in town for the week, and I don't really have a place to stay, dot, dot, dot.
Marceline| Mnh. How many souls did he suck on his way here?
Finn| Oh, I guess like zero. But-
Hunson| See! I made Finn a cool, new sword and everything!
Marceline| I guess you can crash here.
Marceline| That is not what's happening.
Finn| We're gonna jet, Marcy.
Hunson| What?! You just got here. Invite them in, Marceline.
Hunson| Do you have a bathroom?
Marceline| Yeah, there's one upstairs.
Hunson| I just have to freshen up.
Marceline| Is my dad really behaving himself this time?
Finn| He's just been singing songs and stuff.
Jake| Yeah, he seems pretty fun for an old guy. Hey, wait a minute... I'm an old guy!
Hunson| Hey, excuse my unsociableness. There's just one thing; The Venetian blinds in your bathroom kind of jumped out at me and got broken.
Marceline| How could you wreck the blinds just by going to the bathroom?
Hunson| Let me make it up to you. I've got some soy sauce and some ketchup.
Marceline| I'm good.
Hunson| Here's an SD card, some twist ties.
Marceline| I don't want any of this junk!
Hunson| Hey! I'm gonna need a place to sleep tonight. Do you have an air mattress?
Marceline| Yeah.
Hunson| Great! You can sleep on the air mattress, and I'll sleep on your bed.
Marceline| It's in the closet.
Hunson| Finn, are you gonna let my little girl blow up that air mattress?
Finn| Not on my watch!
Marceline| Hey, Dad, I think I'm gonna go out for a walk before bedtime.
Finn| But, Marcy don't you have a solo gig tonight?
Marceline| Ss-ss-ss-ss!
Jake| I get it. It's air mattress talk. Ss-ss-ss-ss. Aren't you giving a concert tonight? Ss-ss-ss. At the Ghost Amphitheater? Ss-ss-ss.
Hunson| Concert? It's a good thing your friends remembered that.
Hunson| Let's go!
Finn| Do you hear, like, a really stupid-sounding laugh?
Jake| Yes.
Chicle| I have a nice laugh.
Chicle| Time to blend in completely unnoticed. 
Chicle| Hey, what you got there? Peanuts?
Marceline| Hello, Hamburger Hills Cemetery!
Hunson| Marceline! You're doing great, baby!
Marceline| I haven't started yet.
Hunson| Hey, Pennebaker! No illegal recording unless you're family. Yoink.  Just ignore me.
Marceline| Dad! You're wrecking the show!
Hunson| This is my daughter! I am proud of my punk daughter! I made that!
Jake| Sit down, man!
Peppermint Butler| Yeah, you're killing the vibe.
Hunson| I'm just explaining my part in all this.
Chicle| Ugh. This is terrible. Boo, I say.
Ghost| Yeah! Boooo!
Hunson| Don't worry, honey. I'll work the crowd. Hey, it's me Hunson! I'm happy to field any questions from you dummies.
Chicle| Can you believe Marceline has a bougie trash daddy? I heard this guy even eats ghosts, you know, like us.
Ghost| What? Really?!
Hunson| Sure, sometimes.
Ghost| Off the stage, skin sack!
Hunson| Okay, okay, settle down, pal. Don't make me come out there.
Ghost|" What you gonna do ""eat my fries?"""
Marceline|  My bass!
Hunson| Come on, ectoplasm comes right off. 
Marceline| Don't! You wreck everything.
Ghost| Mad daddy!
Hunson| Hammer fist strike!
Chicle| Let's get him, fellas.
Hunson| Ha-ha!
Marceline| Dad, quit clowning.
Hunson| Uh, just havin' a little fun.
Marceline| Come on, Dad, fight back!
Finn| He can't. Pep Buts bound his powers.
Marcline| What?!
Hunson| They sassed you.
Finn| Better pop that cork, Peps.
Peppermint Butler| All right. All right.
Finn| Chicle!
Chicle| Oh, whoops, was that bad? 
Ghost| Vampires can't hurt ghosts, stupid.
Marceline|  Shoot.
Finn| Finn's turn! 
Ghost| Wha?!
Marceline|  Good night, Hamburger Hills! There will be no encore.
Princess Bubblegum| My gracious. I'm so sorry you had to deal with Cousin Chicle's schemes. My family's out of control.
Hunson| It's fine. My cool daughter took care of it. And guess what I got from a vendor.  It looks too big to me. But they said that's the style now with punk rockers.
Marceline| Thanks for standing up for me tonight.
Hunson| I'm bad, but I'm no so bad, right? So when are you gonna have some kids?
Marceline| Dad!
Finn & Jake|   Ohhhh!  Ahhh!
Finn|   Oh! Oh, man! My throwing and catching disc! Jake! Wanna play throw-n-catch throwing a catching disc?!
Jake|  Ha ha! Yeah man!
Finn & Jake|   Throw-n-catch! Throw-n-catch!

Jake|    More like the perfect blow! That blew.
Finn|  Aw, come on! That was the wind! The wind blows!
Jake|   Hey, you want me to grab it?
Finn|  Naw, I'll get it!
Jake|  Okay, but it's right here
Finn|   Sometimes a man  just has to retrieve his own disc. 
Jake|    Good luck buddy!
Finn|  Thanks!
Porcupine|  Oh, well hello there my friend. What are you doing?
Finn|  I'm trying to get to the top of this tree to get my disc.
Porcupine|  Oh, well maybe I can help!  Sit on me.
Finn|  Uhhhh, What?
Porcupine|   Well sit on my needles and the shock will boost you high up into the air!  Sit on me, its okedo-its fine, go ahead.
Finn|  I don't think that kinda thing really works, actually.
Porcupine|  You can do it if you believe in yourself! Sit on me.
Finn|   No. 
Porcupine|  Oooh, alriight, I'll shooow you! 
Finn|   Ouch! 
Porcupine|  Sorry! I thought that would work.    I'm just no help at all. 
Finn|  Ooch!  Hmmm.   See! Ya did help! 
Finn|   Poooooped!   Pooooooped!
Squirrel|  Oh I apologize for staring,  but I've never seen a chipmunk as big as you
Finn|   I'm not a chipmunk! I'm a human boy! I'm trying to climb the tree, I'm trying to get my disc back. But for now I'm takin' a break, because I am pooooped!
Squirrel|  You should eat an apple to reinvigorate your climbing ability. 
Finn|  No thanks, I'm good, just gonna rest my meat hooks. 
Squirrel|   Huh? Huh?   
Squirrel|    Aw, that apple was cursed or something. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Oh, dear I ruined your day and now you'll never get your disc.
Finn| Naw, it's okay. I've been in worse situations. And even though I'm tiny, I do feel invigorated.
Squirrel|  Oh, good! What a relief!  Best of luck to you! 
Finn|  Bye! Bye!  Choo Choo!  Ya can't stop the train! Tree!   Woof. 
Jake|   Wohoah! You're tiny!
Finn|  I ate a magic apple by mistake.
Jake|  Uhh! No wonder it's been takin' so long! Need any help?
Finn|  Nah, I got it.
Jake|  Okay, well, I'm gonna walk Lady home. I'll be back later. Don't eat any more magic apples. Silly.
Finn|  Yeah. No I won't.  I don't plan to.
Jake|   Thank you for packing.
Lady Rainicorn|  천만에. 
Jake|  You should take it easy.
Lady Rainicorn|  괜찮아. 
Jake| No, no, let's get you back.
Finn|   Blegh! DISC!   
Finn|   Woooo!  Where's my dingus? 
Finn|   Hey! Hey, buddy! Hey, have you seen  my disc! Hey, I'm over here! Hey!
Squirrel|  
Finn|   Hey! I'm over here! Have you seen my disc?
Squirrel|  Wrap it up good so I don't trip and fall on my face like the last time.
Finn|  Heeey!  Musta could not heard me.  Doing, doing, doing.  Hey squirrel! 
Owl|   I think we all agree, the human must be stopped! 
Finn|   Woah!
Owl|   Squirrel! What happened with the apple?
Squirrel|   Well, I made sure he ate that apple like you guys told me to do, but get this!  It made him smaller! I think it mighta been cursed you guys!
Owl|  Well a-course it was cursed! We're tryin' to stop the human!    Look, just do me a kindness and go get me some more nut milk.  Come on fellas! I feel like I'm the only one comin' up with ideas here, Lenny! How do you think we should stop the human?
Lenny the Beaver|  Uuum… Maybe uh, trapdoor! Sometin' like that, with gravity! 
Owl|  Hey, yeah! We could put like a rug over it!
Finn|    My disc!  Uuuh, It's okay, III'm a chipmunk.
All the animals|   In the tree, part of the tree.
Squirrel|   Sorry.
All the animals|  In the tree, part of the tree. In the tree, part of the tree. In the tree, part of the tree.
Lenny|   Yaaaaaaaa! 
Finn|    Huh? 
Squirrel|  What?
Finn|  Uuuh, I didn't say anything.   What are they gonna do to me?
Squirrel|  What?
Finn|   What are they gonna do-
Squirrel|  I'm not allowed to talk to you.   Anyone and anything that winds up in the tree becomes part of the tree forever and ever. In the tree, part of the tree.
Finn|  So does that mean I'm a prisoner forever?
Squirrel|  Well yes. And no. Are you a prisoner? Yes. Will you ever be free? No. In the tree, part of the tree. It's very simple.
Finn|  Doesn't that mean that you can't leave the tree either?
Squirrel|  No I- Well yes and no. Am I allowed to leave the tree? No. Have I already left the tree? Am I miles away from the tree right now flying around like the flying squirrel that I am? Yes! In my mind! In- my- mind! 
Finn|   Do you like it here?
Squirrel|"  Yeah!  Well, yes and no. Do I like the nuts and acorns? Yes. Do I like it when they put me down and say mean things like ""You're not a flying squirrel, you're just a regular squirrel! Nyaah!""? No. Do I wanna fly away from this place now? Yes. Would I make a break for it if I had a buddy to break out with? Yes."
Finn|  Hey buddy.
Squirrel|  What?
Finn|  Let's get outta here.  I got it!
Owl|  What are you doing regular, nonflying squirrel? Put that back!   How dare you!  Well alright! Everybody after those…two!
Finn|   Okay! I'm gonna throw the disc alongside the branch the we'll jump on it and fly away!
Squirrel|  Yeah!
Finn|  Perfect! Throw!  Sooo, It's a- It's a good thing you're a flying squirrel. Huh.
Squirrel|  Well yes and no. 
Finn|    Peace ooooout!  Okay! Activate your squirrel flaps!
Squirrel|  Flaps? No, I just have regular squirrel arms!
Finn and the Squirrel|   Aaaaaaah!
Squirrel|  Oh! No- 
Finn|  Hey! We're flying! 
Squirrel|  Oohoho-Oh yeah! 
Finn|  Wooo!  Hey look! There's Jake!  Jake! 
Jake|     The perfect throw! 
Fool| Hey, this is nuts, right?  Look, I've got both my teeth.  Look! I lost one in a box turtle once. Also, I used to be dead.
Vampire King| Mwah!  Fool, this is life. Get a hot dog if you can't take the bun.
Empress| Pah! It tastes different here. Where are we? It's like we fell asleep on a raft and woke up in strange seas.
Hierophant|" Hmph! ""Fell asleep""? We died. The demon Marceline staked us all. Why are we back? How did it happen? Listen—I dunno and I don't care. We're alive and I'm going to get eating."
Empress| Ugh.
Fool|  Ahhh... Does anyone have any milk for this?  Do you, like, carry milk?
Cow| Moo!
Cow| Moo?
Empress| This is well and good for you, Hierophant, all you ever needed was a forest and something hot to chew on.
Empress| Where are the comforts of the old hive? The minions... the blood... the good blood with the gold leaf flaked into it.
Vampire King| The gold leaf was stupid. It didn't taste like anything.
Empress| We had standards! It doesn't matter when we are or where we are, because... we are. We must start rebuilding our realm. There's life here, and I bet it's pathetic.
Empress| We march in, we take control, and we rebuild the hive! My king, are you listening?
Fool| I dunno. Like...  What if we just got a loft downtown?
Fool| Whoops, I'm hypnotized.  Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh!
Fool|  Good old backwards egg!
Cow| Ugh. Ugh! I don't like to dance. I'm a wallflower.
Cow| Oh! Ugh.
Hierophant| My king, surely you agree that this is our chance to go back to our old ways. Surely diverging from the old ways is what made us vulnerable the first time. Surely—
Vampire King|" ""Surely""?! Surely? Shirley J. Temple! "
Hierophant| Oh! 
Vampire King| I am your king, and I say it's a new era! Old-fashioned ideas have no place here.
Hierophant|  Do what you like! I know what's right. 
Empress| If you're going to caterwaul like this, then I may as well start building my army. Hasta luego, turds. 
Cow| Oh... gettin' dizzy...
Finn| You sure the sun's not hurting you at all?
Marceline| No, this is great. I can even feel my skin aging.
Jake| Huff! Cow Teeth and Shirley temple Aaaaaaah! I ran into some vampires! They were being weird as crabs! Do you know these oily doilies, Marceline?
Marceline| What?! No! I'm cured! It is weird though that it's happening at about the same time I got un-gunked. I gotta go see Bonnie. Ow! Oh yeah, guess I'm walkin'. No mo' powers.
Finn| Didn't your daddy give you demon powers?
Marceline| My Dad never gave me squat! Well, just some soul-sucking skills. Remember this?
Jake| Aah! My soul!  Ugh, even though I got my soul sucked, I'll still give you a ride to Bonnie's because I'm good.
Marceline| Bonnie, I don't get it. Jake's talking about vamps at the same time you fixed me, and there can't be any still around!
Bubblegum| Well, clearly something's creeping around.
Marceline| Okay, what about the paste you took out of me? That should be all that is left that's vampiric in the modern world.
Bubblegum| It's all over there, safely in the safety bucket. What?! Pep But, what'd you do with the gunk?!
Peppermint Butler| Hold on, I'm working.
Jake| Okay. There was one that looked like if a baby-snake was a baby-baby.
Jake| Nah, that's not right. There was another one that looked like if an ant hill were a girl.
Jake| Nah, that's not right. There's one of them that looked like a wet uncle.
Jake| Nah, that's not right. There was a lady who looked like black drapes on a cake pop.
Jake| Nah, that's not right. There was also one that looked like an angry stop sign coming out of a loaf of bread.
Jake| Nah, that's not oh, actually that one's pretty close.
Marceline| What?!
Vampire King| You can stop this now, Marceline, it's not too late. You've got power now. I see it. But you haven't paid a price. It's making you crazy. Marceline, there's no one left but me. Would you wipe out an entire species?
Marceline| For the last time, yes! That is literally my entire plan!
Vampire King| So be it then.
Marceline| Uh Duh.
Vampire King| I gave you a chance, Marcel
Marceline| Blah, blah, blah, blah!
Vampire King| You know, Marceline, there's still another way.
Marceline| Give it a rest already!
Vampire King| No another 'nother way To save my people.
Marceline| Wait! Noooo!
Marceline| This is really bad. These guys They're heavy hitters. If they get back to full strength, they'll tear this world apart.
Bubblegum| What's the plan, Marceline? How do we fight them?
Peppermint Butler|  If I may Strong enough for an ultravampire But made for a vampire.
All| Wow.
Finn| Look, Jake, a two-pronged stake And a stake boomerang.
Peppermint Butler| Yes, and what's this behind your ear? A super garlic bomb!
Bubblegum| What the heck, Peps? Why do you have all this vampire junk lying around?
Peppermint Butler| I have these high-tech weapons painstakingly stockpiled in case a certain frenemy of yours decides to turn on us someday.
Bubblegum| Peps!
Marceline| No no, he's right. I could've snapped and done you all in at any time.
Jake| Ugh!
Marceline| The cave is totally empty. No sign of anyone.
Finn| Phew!
Bubblegum| Nothing going on out here either. Maybe we should all fan out Look for tracks.
Finn| Or clues.
Marceline| All right. But everyone be careful. Even in their mushy state, these guys'll crack up ya sacrum.
Jake| Gross.
Bubblegum| Don't worry about us, Marceline.
Finn| Yeah, we're ready for anything.
Marceline| Can't smell nuthin' no more. Ugh! Ahh. Crud.
Finn| Whoops.
Peppermint Butler| Oh no, my bomb!
Marceline| Hey guys, why don't y'all head back to the cabin? I'm gonna try to put together a profile, you know Forensically.
Bubblegum| Okay, Marceline, sounds good. Come on, boys, let's get you cleaned up.
Marceline| I know you're in there, you skunk. You butt. You stain. You
Marceline| Hey. Long time no see.
Vampire King| Indeed.
Fool| Hey! Marceline! Look at me! I'm all grown up now! I ate a chicken, Marceline.
Marceline| I see you're getting your strength back.
Vampire King| Yes, not long now.
Marceline| Well don't get your hopes up.
Fool| Pbht! Pbht!
Marceline| Things are different now. The humans are long gone.
Vampire King| Someone's smelling a bit human herself these days. Anyway, you don't need to worry, I've changed, as well. I only eat animals now. Just like everyone else.
Cow| Ugh. Huh?
Vampire King| Does that mean we can be friends now, Marceline?
Marceline| It doesn't matter how you pretend to change. You've done enough already to get staked a thousand times over. You're monsters. You'll always be
Fool| Smell my feet, Marceline. I promise you won't regret it. Oooh! Ohhhh Your loss.
Vampire King| You know, the others won't be so easy, Marceline.
Marceline| Well how 'bout you?
Vampire King| It doesn't have to be like this.
Marceline| Those are some pretty frou-frou last words.
Marceline| You've lost a step! I'm not even gonna need my powers.
Vampire King| I'm surprised, Marceline.
Marceline| What now?
Vampire King| Surprised you have the time to play around while the empress makes her way to the land of ice and snow.
Marceline| Simon. Crud!
Finn| Eww! The sea lard’s in my bed again. Gross.
Jake| Dude. That’s like the 8th time. Why don’t you just get rid of it?
Finn| I don’t know what’s gotten into it lately.
Jake| It's gross as butts, man. We’re taking care of this right now.
Finn| I can’t believe we never thought of this before. The pond is the perfect place for a sea lard.
Jake| See ya larder!
Jake|  Huh.
Finn| Is he, like, okay?
Shelby| Well, seeing as sea lards are saltwater fish, and the pond is a freshwater environment… ...no? He’s a stenohaline fish. Haven’t you guys ever heard of osmoregulation? Allow me to explain.
Shelby|  Waaaa! 
Finn| Sorry Shelby. Gotta save the lard.
Jake|  Thar!
Finn|  Wa?
Water Nymphs|  ♫♪♪Smash the frogs, smash the frogs, making frog hot dogs, smash the frogs…..♫♪♪
Finn|  Whoa!
Water Nymph|  Finn and Jake!  Yo! Finn and Jake are here!
Water Nymphs #2 and #3| ♫♪♪Smash the frog -  Hi!
Finn| So, this is where you guys live?
Water Nymphs #2 and #3| Yeah!
Water Nymph #2| We’re the guardians of this grotto.
Water Nymph| You guys want to stay for lunch? We’re making hot dogs!
Finn and Jake|  Hot dogs?!?!
Finn|  Oh, wait. We dropped our sea lard in the pond, and we’ve got to save it before it dies from the freshwater. He’s a stenohaline fish.
Water Nymph #3| You do know sea lards are mammals, right?
Finn|  Uhh.. I definitely knew that.  I’m gonna murder Shelby.
Water Nymph| Well, hey, you guys should stick around. I’m gonna go finish cooking. 
Water Nymphs #2 and #3|  And we gotta mash more frogs.
Finn| I can’t believe I just believe Shelby ‘cause he’s a nerd.
Jake|  I know. It's in his tone.  Hey, it's the lard!
Finn|  Hey, get away from there!
Finn|  Bad lard! Lard!!
Water Nymph|  Huh?  Don’t go near there! It’s too dangerous!
Finn|  Got to save this dang lard!
Water Nymph|  Whatever you do, don’t touch the purple stuff!
Finn|  WHOOAH!
Finn|  What did she say? Don’t touch the purple?
Finn|  What happened to the pond?
Jake| And how ‘bout our treehouse? The house part’s a-gone! 
Finn|  What the butt?
Jake| I guess we went through some portal to the past or some biz.
Finn|  Was stuff the wrong color in the past?
Finn|  It's weird as carbs here.
Jake|  The sea lard!  There it goes!
Finn|  Lard!
Pond|  Hello, friends!
Finn|  Lard! Lard! Lard! Lard! Lard!
Jake| Lard, lard, lard, lard, lard
Finn|   ♫♪♪La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la laaaa!♫♪♪
Jake| You are crazy. You are so crazy!
Finn|  Everything’s like, wonky here. It’s familiar, but weird.
Jake|  I like it.
Finn| I don’t know. It kind of makes me feel… naked. ♫♪♪ La-la-la laaaard!♫♪♪
Finn| Gotcha! Finally, we can take you home!
Finn and Jake|  Huh?
Leaf Marceline| ♫♪♪A one-and a-two- I’d rather be anything but me, a leaf on a tree, a bug or a bee. I just want to see the sea, I want to be free from this body, this flower body.♫♪♪
Finn|  Please don’t change. You’re perfect just the way you are.
Leaf Marceline| Oh, I know! I just like to write sad songs.
Finn and Jake|  Ohh! 
Finn| Wait. Hey, Jake, what were we just doing?
Leaf Marceline|  ♫♪♪Chasin’ the fish, Chasin’ the fish, and its getting away♫♪♪ 
Leaf Marceline|  Bye!  You guys are writing this down, right?
Finn| Why does the lard keep running away? We're trying to get it home.
Jake| Yeah, this place ain't safe.
Princess Purple Patch|  ♫♪♪bum-bum-bum, little purple, you're a catch, I love your pretty purple sash. We're a perfect purple match, Welcome to my purple patch♫♪♪!
Princess Purple Patch| I'm Princess Purple Patch, and this is my little special Purple.  Mwah!

Princess Purple patch| I'ma call you Purple Face! You want to come play in my purple place?

Princess Purple Patch| Oh, you want purple? Here, take some for the road!
Princess Purple Patch|  Oh, dear, I've purpled you.
Princess Purple Patch|  Why do I always do this? 
Purple|  Later.
Jake|  Heh! What a great gal.
Finn| Yeah.  Purple!  Wait- what were we just doing? We were.... We were.... Who are we?
Jake| I don't know, man.  But I like these things.
Finn|  Foon. I'm--- I'm Foon.  I'm..  Fine.
Finn| Huh? Ja-- Ja-- Jaaauump!
Finn| Hello. Are you a lost dog? I am boy.
Jake| Uh.. maybe?
Finn| We are boy and dog.
Jake| I'm petting the ground, boy.
Finn| Looks like fun.
Finn| And it smells like toast.
Finn| Huh? Crying. Long nose. 
Finn and Jake|  Investigate!
Finn|  Miss, your crying indicates you're in need of help.
Bush Boots| What?  Yes. I've lost my rolling pin.
Finn| Understood. What's your name, miss?
Bush Boots| I'm Bush Boots, the little apricot anteater 
Finn and Jake| Hugs!
Bush Boots|  The hugs helped my crying, but it didn't help me find my rolling pin.
Finn| Boy and dog will find your rolling pin.  Where did you last see it?
Bush Boots| It was rolling around here not too long ago.
Bush Boots| Oh, there it goes!
Bush Boots| Come back, you bad little rolling pin!
Finn| Bush Boots, lets sneak up on it.
Jake|  Am-boosh!
Bush Boots|  Oh, you caught it! Wonderful!
Bush Boots|  Come on, now. Just roll the dough.
Bush Boots|  Oh, its getting away again!
Finn| Ma'am, I think that rolling pin is sentient.
Jake|  Yeah, I don't think it wants to be a rolling pin.
Finn| Dog, we have to save that rolling pin from this sweet lady.  Where did it go?
Finn|  Rolling pin! We want to help!
Finn| No more.. Slime.
Jake| Rolling pin trail has gone cold.
Finn| A bee. 
Jake| I see.
Bee| A poem by me. Listen for a sound and look around.
Finn and Jake|  Hmm?
Bee| It's a metaphor.
Jake| A pink pond.
Finn| Pink pond? Pretty!
Pink pond|  Hee hee! Hello, friends!
Jake| The pond has a face and is talking to us.
Finn|  Yeah.
Pink pond|  Dive in.
Finn| I don't feel comfortable diving into a face.
Finn| Dog, lets go back for apricot pie.
Jake|  Yeah, pie!
Jake| Gross!
Finn|  Whoaaa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jake| And then there was like, a PB puddle, a Marceline plant, and a little bee that looked like you, BMO! You know what? We didn't save the sea lard. The sea lard saved us.
BMO| Yay, sea lard!
Ice King|  Wow, what an adventure.
Jake|  And there was even a purple lady kind of like you, Ice King! She even sounded just like you.
Ice King| She sounds magnificent! How'd you say you got there?
Jake| We didn't. Beat it, creep.
Ice King| I'll figure it out.
Finn| But Simon, if you go there, you'll lose you memories.
Ice King| What memories? I'm like a goldfish over here.
Jake|  In what way, exactly?
Ice King| Oh, hey Jake.  Where am I?
Finn| Comfy, dude? I bet you ran away 'cause we didn't appreciate you and called you gross and stuff. But you're not gross.  Mwah! Goodnight, sea lard.
Finn|  Man, why am I so sleepy?
Jake|   Dude, we've been up for like seven days.
Finn|   For real-sies?
Jake|  Yeah, for real-sies!  Remember? First, we rescued the Slime Princess from the Ghost Ship Vortex. And then we slayed that fire dragon. And that took a couple of days.
Finn|  Then we went to LSP's quinceañera.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, no way. You guys made it!
Jake|  Helped Peppermint Butler with his Goblin problem.
Peppermint Butler|  I swear that I found it like this. I don't know what happened.
Finn|  We'll take care of it, Peppermint Butler.
Finn|  We rescued Wildberry Princess from the Ice King.
Ice King|  I just wanna be happy!
Jake|  Then, we captured that Bandito.
Sheriff|  Thanks, you guys.
Jake|  Saved the house...
Man|  Thanks, you guys.
Jake|  And fed that duck.
Jake|  We've had a busy week.
Finn|  I'm exhausted. But happy!
Jake|  Good night, buddy.
Finn|  Good night!  That's right, Finn. Adventure 'til you drop.  Hey, Jake?
Jake|  Yeah?
Finn|  Can you sleep?
Jake|  No.
Finn|  I can't sleep either.
Jake|  Yeah, what's going on with that?
Finn|  I don't know. But, I've got the strangest feeling...that we're being watched.
Finn|  Why is that horse staring at us?
Finn|  That's super creepy.
Jake|  Man, I just wanna go to sleep.
Finn|  Well, maybe he's gone.
Jake|  Not gonna be able to sleep with that horse watchin' me.
Finn|  Let's just close the shade.
Jake| Outta sight and outta mind.
Finn|  Good work, Jake
Jake|  See 'ya in the morning, pal.
Finn|  Ahh! Why won't it stop?!
Jake|  All right, man. Let's just go...push it off that hill or something.
Finn|  Maybe we can just...politely ask it to leave.
Jake|  Hey! Get out of here, horse! I want to go to sleep, and you're creeping me the math out!
Finn|  Whoa, man! Let me try, diplomat style.  Pardon me horse, I beseech thou to split from mine land, this night. But I welcome thee to come back for some luncheth, some other day. Okay?
Jake|  Forget it, man. This horse is whack. It's got poo-brain.
Finn|   Okay, you're right. We can try pushing it, now.
Finn|  Move, horsey! Good Grod, Jake! Are you even pulling?!
Jake|  I'm super-pulling!
Finn|  This horse has a ridiculous weight!
Finn|  Math this. What now, man.
Jake|  I didn't wanna have to use my powers on you, horse, because I'm so sleepy. But you've pushed Jake too far!
Giant Jake|  RAAAAHH! AH-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!
Finn|  You shouldn't creep us out from way over there!
Jake|  Let's get back to bed, buddy.
Finn|  Oh yeah, I'm so ready for bed.
Jake|  I wanna marry my bed.
Finn|  Me too!
Jake|  No more.... NO MORE!
Finn|  Where are you going?!
Jake|  I have an idea!  I did it! Ha-ha! He can't stare at us if he's blind!
Finn|  Look, man. 
Jake|  Wh..why?! Stupid blindfold! What's your deal, screwy?! Why are you messin' with us, huh?!
Finn|  Jake! That horse is whack with poo-brain.
Jake|  Yeah, I know, Finn. I diagnosed this horse with whacked out poo-brain five minutes ago.
Finn|  Dude, poo-brain means we can lure it away from here using music.  Everything brainless likes music.
Jake|  That's true! You're a genius!  All right horse, prepare to be lured!  Follow me, Horsey.
Finn|  Jake? It's not luring!
Jake|  Huh! Hmmm.  So, Beet-hoven's not luring enough for you, is it? Well, how about some Mozzart?! 
Finn|  Huh?!
Finn|  Ha! 
Finn|  Stop! You're luring snakes! STOP!!
Jake|  Huh? Oh, nuts. Let me try and lure a mongoose! 
Finn|  Stop man!
Jake|  No! Ahh!  Dude... let's kill the horse.
Finn|  What?!
Jake|  I'm so tired, Finn!
Finn|  No, man, we're not killing the horse.
Jake|  Okay, we won't kill the horse. We'll dress him up like a bunny! Ha-ha! And get a giant hawk—Caaaww!--To kill him!
Finn|  Wah?!
Jake|  Caaawww! Caaawwwwww!
Finn|  No, man! That is wrong.
Jake|  Eh. Did I say that the hawk would kill him? I meant that the hawk would swoop down gently and take him away to an island of sunshine and love-stuff and, take care of him.
Finn|  Whoa. That sounds awesome.
Jake|  What do think?
Finn|  It looks like a bunny?
Both|  Hey Come and get it hawk, let's go!
Finn|  Hey Jake, I think I see a hawk or two.  Cause more commotion to help the hawks!
Both|  Ahhh! Blblblblblblblblblbl!  Take the bunny!
Finn|  Hey, there they are! They see our commotions!
Both|  Riiiiiighhhhhht here! Yeah!
Jake|  Grab a good hold and fly away!
Finn|  The bunny! The bunny!
Finn|  What a beautiful sight.
Both|  We did it! Back to sleep!
Both|  
Finn|  Good night, buddy.
Jake|  Good night, buddy.
Finn|  Ahh! It's in our house now!
Jake|  That's obvious, Finn! You don't have to say that out loud!
Finn|  Hey, this is all your fault, dude! If you weren't so darn handsome, animals wouldn't always be staring at you!
Jake|  You're just mad at me for being...handsome? Well, you're the one who told me to lure snakes! Ahhh!
Finn|  I told you to lure the horse! You lured the snakes! There's even one here in my underpants!  Wait a minute, dude. Can't you see what this horse is doing?  It's tearing us apart.
Jake|  Aw, man.. you're right! We have to get rid of this horse, for us!
Finn|  I know, bro. I know. 
Jake|  Oh, Finn; this horse is bringing us together now. This horse is a blessing.
Finn|  What?! Dude, you've lost it!
Jake|  You...wait, wait.  The horse is tearing us apart again!
Finn|  You're right! It's about time I show this horse who's the man.
Jake|  What are you going to do?
Finn|  Say that to me again.
Jake|  What are you going to do?!
Finn|  Do... Doo-doo. I'm going to kick that horse in the bottom!
Jake|  Oh, my Grod!
Finn and Jake|  The Ice King?!
Ice King|  I should go.
Finn|  You were spying on us?!
Ice King|  That's none of your business!
Jake|  He was trying to learn our bedtime secrets!
Finn|   Were you?
Jake|"   He was! Did you find out that I sleep ""in the nude""?"
Jake|  It's none of your business how nude I sleep, Ice King! Nnnnone of your business!
Ice King|  Gentlemen, I'll see you later.
Both|  Hmph!
Jake|  Here's your sword, dude!
Finn|  Thank you.
Finn|  Jake! Jake! Look out!
Jake|  Tell us why you were spying!
Ice King|  NO!
Finn|  Snakes!
Jake|  Quick! Throw them to the Ice King!
Finn|  What's he doing?
Jake|  He's using his ice powers.
Finn and Jake|  Ow! Ouch! Ow! Hey! Hey!
Ice King|  Is that all the ice ya have?
Finn|  Yeeesss!
Ice King|  Well, you should really have more.
Finn|  We don't need any more.
Ice King|  What if you had guests?
Finn|  Guests bring their own ice.
Finn|  Tell us why you're watchin' us or we'll - we'll cut off your stupid head.
Jake|  Yeah and make it quick 'cause we're both really sleepy.
Ice King|  Ok, ok, I'll tell you! I was watching you... to learn how to be happy.
Finn|  What?
Jake|  Huh?
Ice King|  It's true! I would like to be happy like you guys. But, I have no idea how.
Jake|  So, you dressed up like a horse?
Ice King|  Have pity on me.  I've been so sad and miserable, I cry all the time. But, whenever I see you two, you always look so happy.
Ice King|  But, they're just hopping over each other.
Ice King|  So yes, I've decided to spy on you, dressed as a horse. 
Ice King|  But, I guess my plan failed. All I observed was you two arguing over...how to get rid of me.
Ice King|  Hey, are you sleeping?  Is this it? Sleeping? Could it be that all I need is a good night's rest? 
Ice King|  Ahh... I'm... still not happy.
Finn| Wow, everything sucks here!
Jake| Finn, look!
Finn| Oh jeez, this looks pretty real.  He's got the Enchiridion!  And, wait, is that Billy? Why is he so tiny?
Jake|  Hey, there's our guy!
Farmworld/Ice Finn|  WOOHOO! HAHAHAHAHAHA!  Yeah, just hang out there for a while! I love it! I feel fresh, hahahahahaha!
Finn|  Well, this is the weirdest thing I've ever done. 
Finn, Jake, and BMO| Round and round and round we go!
BMO| Hiya!
Finn and Jake|  Oh yeah!
BMO|  School's out 'ya trench!
Jake| Woah!  Oof!
Finn| Hey, Prismo's calling!
Jake| Nice! Let's go say hi.
BMO| You're lucky I don't take you out, kid!  Quit crying baby!
Finn and Jake|  PRRRIIIIIIISSSSSMM- 
BMO|  Oof!
Finn and Jake|  OOOOOO!
Finn| TION!
Prismo| Thanks for responding to my call, guys! I'm in a serious pickle, and I mean the brown kind. I mean like a really smelly, brown pickle.
Jake| Don't sweat it, boy! Finn and I got yo' back!
Finn|  Who's bullying you Prismo?!
Prismo| Nobody's bullying me. Look, um, remember when you wished the lich never existed and you created a new wish reality that ended up totally not working out?
Finn| No.
Jake| Vaguely, yes.
Finn| What?
Jake| You don't remember making that wish!
Finn| Wu-huh?
Jake| I thought I explained it to you that one time.
Prismo| Dude, I'll catch you up.  Look!  After you wished the lich never existed, you accidentally created an alternate wish reality where magic doesn't really exist.
Finn| Wait! . Who's that dude?
Prismo| That's you! But sort of less cool.
Finn| Uh-huh, proceed.
Prismo| So you find an old Marceline and the crown on the body of Ice King's skeleton who was smushed under the weight of a frozen mitogenic bomb. But then the destiny gang steals your family donkey, so you use the crown to become Ice Finn and save your donkey and your family. But, the crown makes you crazy, and you ice everything up like a dumb bozo, which sets off the mitogenic bomb, which releases the spirit of the lich anyway. But then, this reality's Jake made a counter wish which supposedly fixed the problem, but as it turned out, it didn't really.
Finn| Can I just say that I don't remember any of this stuff.
Prismo| Because technically it didn't happen to you. But, also it still happened, and that wish reality continues to exist.
Finn| Is this why all of a sudden one day I was better at the flute.
Jake| Oh yeah, I noticed that!
Prismo| Listen! Something, really bad, is about to go down.  Ice Finn is using his world's Enchiridion to build a portal to the multiverse. I literally do not know what will happen if he succeeds, but it could def's be catastrophic to the architecture of these realities. Now if that happens, my boss, let me repeat that, my BOSS will hold ME responsible, and by proxy, y'all both be in the dip too.
Finn| Why don't you just bloop bloop it all better?
Prismo| Something there is dampening my powers. I AM LOSING MY PICS OVER THIS BIZ!
Jake|  His boss! Who's that?
Finn| Alright, man, what do we do? 
Prismo| Take this, and use it to take care of the Ice Finn.
Finn| Oh, wait what do you mean by take care o-
Prismo| Good luck guys we're all depending on you! 
Finn|  Woah.
Jake| What is it?
Finn|  Oh golly!
Jake|  What's that thing now?
Finn|" It's like 50 bowling balls on my teen bod! Oh, check it! There's instructions.  The maid will handle all Class A interdimensional Bung-ups if you follow these simple steps direct the small end of the Maid towards your massive mistake . Focus your intention until all distractions leave your thought sphere . Then recite the words ""A man needs a maid"" three times. Alright . Here we go!  Help help help help help help help! "
Jake| Lower it!
Finn| Ledge ledge ledge!  Ok! Focus my intention. 
Farmworld/Ice Finn| Just a few more jewels before I can open the portal to a better world!
Finn| My intention to heal the madness of this other self.
Jake| Wait, wait, wait. I don't think that's what we're supposed to do. Prismo said take care of him.
Finn| Yeah, that means make him feel better.
Jake| Are you being stupid on purpose?
Finn| Yeah, but dude, that is me!
Finn Sword| That's me!
Jake| I heard you the first time!
Finn| There's gotta be something else we can do.
Jake| Bro, you heard Prismo, we don't have a choice.
Finn|  Ok, but you do it! I just can't man i- it's too messed up.
Jake| Alright, you're right. Shut your eyes and cover your ears!
Finn|  Mamamamamamama.
Jake|  A man needs a maid .  A man... needs... a maid. A maaaaan , needs... a... . Nope! This is bull juice!
Prismo|  Oh, flip!
Finn| Mamamamama-
Jake| hey, hey!
Finn| Did you do it?
Jake| Nah man! Let's just go steal the Enchiridion.
Finn| Woah yeah! That way he can't open the portal and nobody gets obliterated!  That should work!
Prismo| That's not gonna work you guys! Don't walk away from the maid! NOOOOO!
Farmworld/Ice Finn|  It's gonna be so great in the next place, guys! It's like we're spinning, spinning, spinning into the new land!  Hahahahahahahaha! Woohoo! Hahahahaha! 
Finn|  Sneaky fashion! 
Farmworld/Ice Finn| What's this? Oh! Two more converts to my empire of frost!?
Jake| Finn, I love you! Just in case we eat it fighting this guy.
Finn| Oh, yeah, I love you too.
Farmworld//Ice Finn| Hahahahahahaha!  Wonderful! I thought I'd rescued all the humans! Now you can hang out here with everyone else! Gunther says we just need a few more gems. Anyway, now I'm going to freeze you!
Jake| WAIT! 
Farmworld/Ice Finn| Huh?!
Jake| Straight up magic!
Farmworld/Ice Finn| Are you a wizard too?!
Jake| Yeah, check out my amazing wizard bod!  Hey over here man, look at me! I'm a portal to another world. 
Farmworld/Ice Finn| You can't be!
Jake| I'm magic, I can do anything! Don't you believe your own eyes? 
Farmworld/Ice Finn| Why would you be able to turn in-
Jake| Why anything? Why's the sky blue, bro? That's right, just keep looking at me!
Bobby| Hey, what's up?
Finn| I'll get you out of this, Billy!
Bobby|  It's Bobby.  Look out!
Finn|  Who's that?

Farmworld/Ice Finn| What? What's going on? Bartrum?

Jake|  It's like the most evil heartburn!
Finn| JAAAAKE! Get out of the way! . A man needs a maid, a man needs a maid, a man needs a maid!
The Maid|  Ding! Housekeeping! 
Farmworld Lich| AAAAAAAHHHHHH!
Farmworld Jake|  Bark bark bark!
Jake| You're Welcome! Ha, I don't know what he's saying. Let's bounce. 
Finn| Prismo, wait!  We have so much to talk about . Oh. Prismo, I'm sorry if this is breaking the rules but you gotta help this guy out. He's just always gonna be messed up with that crown around. 
Prismo| Ok, I can try rearranging some stuff. Just a quick cut,  aaaaaaand, paste! There! Now the ground zero bomb explosion should destroy the crown in that reality, aaaaaaaand, play! So yeah, this all goes down again, bomb goes off, so yeah! The crown is totally gone.  Your guy here goes back to normal. 
Jake| D'aaawwwww!
Finn| Huh, that's his family.
Jake| Hey look how dumb I am in that world. Here's me. Woof woof woof! Hahahahaha! I eat stuff off the ground. I don't know, what are dogs even into these days?
Finn|  Ow ow, ow! 
Jake|  Your shoe rash is gross, man.  Oh, I'm gonna throw up!  Ah, I'm just kidding!
Finn|  Man, I wish I had my other sock, this callous is gonna junk up my good time at PB's potluck.
Jake|  Don't worry man, we're going to have a ton of fun. We'll eat some melon, I'll get some compliments on my pretty makeup.
Finn|  You look like a target.
Jake|  I look pretty!
Princess Bubblegum|   Does everyone have a tray?
Finn|    Bounce House! Come on, Jake!  Bounce bounce! 
Bounce House Princess|  Oh ho. Oh, hi Finn.
Finn|  Oh my goodness, sorry Bounce House Princess, I didn't know it was you.
Bounce House Princess|  Ah ha, that's okay, you wanna go inside, bounce around a little?

Princess Bubblegum|  What's up with the limp?
Finn|  I've been going foot nude in the shoe and now I got this turbo huge callous. 
Jake|  
Princess Bubblegum|  Well, sit down and relax. Oh, by the way, I've entered everyone's name into a raffle and the winner gets whatever is in that. 
Finn|  Mysterious. Oh, brought something for the party!
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, how wonderful!
Finn|  Bam! Soda!
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh...
Finn|  It's warm and I shook it up... a lot.
Princess Bubblegum|  Well, great, I'll just put this on ice. 
Ice King|     Someone outside is messing with my ice!  Let's see what's going on down there Gunts.  My on-again-off-again GF Princess Bubblegum —  — my BFs Finn and Jake, all the fine princesses that want to date me! What the heck?! My bro-dogs for life are throwing a party without me?!

Finn|  Awww, hey Jake, check out this cat.
Jake|  I don't like cats, man! 
Finn|  Do you like fresh lemon in your ice tea?
Jake|  Yes.
Finn|  
Jake|  Ha ha! Alright!
Princess Bubblegum|   It looks like we don't have to make that lemon run after all.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Yes!
Ice King|"   At least I still have my ""party-poopers,"" heh heh, raagh! Oh glob  Urrreeh!  So much lazagnah. "
Ice King|  Gunter, daddy needs you to dress up like a princess so you can sneak into that party and throw fruit punch on everybody.

Gunter|  Wenk!

Banana Guard|  Banana Guard.
Ice King|  I'm calling to tattle.
Banana Guard|  Oh, okay, who are you tattling on?
Ice King|  The loud party going on next door, it's bothering everyone in the Ice Kingdom.
Banana Guard|  Ice Kingdom? Is this the Ice King?
Ice King|  Yes.
Banana Guard|  Well uh, we hate you, so — 
Banana Guard|  Banana Guard.
Ice King|   Yes, this is a little old lady calling about the loud party.
Banana Guard|  Is this the Ice King?
Ice King|   Noooo, this is Mrs. Garam-bling-ton...
Banana Guard|  Mrs. Garamblington?
Ice King|  Yeah, hold on let me get my husband.   Yeah, this is Ted Garamblington, I need you to shut down this party.
Banana Guard|  Your wife sounds pretty old.
Ice King|  Uh, hold on there's someone at the door.  Yes, hello?   Hey, Mr. Garamblington, it's me, the pizza delivery boy.  Oh, hi, Johnny.  Boy, that sure is a loud party out there, hope it's not bothering the Mrs.  It's okay Johnny, I'm on the phone with the Banana Guard and they're going to take care of it.

Banana Guard|  Uh, Mr. Garamblington?
Ice King|   Yes?

Ice King|  Ha haa!  Now to watch Banana law in action.
Banana Guard|  This is a great party.
Ice King|  Two can play the party game!  Ooh, nice. Alright come on Gunthalina, I need you to pass out some whirling dervishes, the guests are getting restless.
Ice King|   Loose grape medley, stack of enriched flour tortillas — and start with Roger, he looks famished.
Gunthalina|  Wenk! 
Ice King|  Everyone, smile and eat... and make our neighbors jealous. 
Ice King|  Bah! Gunter's too captivating!  Um? Oh yeah!  Oh this is my jam! Time to get my freak nasty on!  Roger, dance with me!   Come on! If only there was some way I could magically ruin their party.  Wait a minute  forgetful me!
Ice King|  I thought you were my bros, my roll dogs for life! 
Bounce House Princess|  Ow! Hey, everyone, take refuge in my body! 
Finn|  Ice King, don't make me stand up and whomp you!
Ice King|  Well, if that's what it takes for a fella to get noticed around here, then whomp me! 
Finn|  That's.... IT! 
Ice King|  Oh mama, that's some stink!  Aaaah!
Finn|  Why are you doing this, IK?!
Ice King|  Because she didn't invite me to her potluck!
Princess Bubblegum|  Yes, I did! I sent your invite in the mail!
Ice King|  The mail?! Who reads the mail! I just stack all my mail in a tall pile until it falls over, heh heh, then I shred it to use as cascarones!  So uh, can I party with you?
Finn|  Only if you promise to stop acting nanners.
Ice King|  Nanners, well I don't even know the meaning of the word.
Ice King|  Whoo ooh! Party time, right guys?! Whooo hooo! 
Princess Bubblegum|  It's time for the raffle. And the winner is.... Finn.
Finn|  Whoa, cool.
Princess Bubblegum|   Congrats, Finn, you won a... Sea Lard.  Here you go.
Finn|  Awesome.
Jake|   You won a sea lard, that donks —  Ah!!!
Squirrel|  YOU SON OF A BLEE-BLOB!!!!  Jaaaaake!!!
Jake| Heeey, yooou...
Swamp Giant|  AAAAH!
Finn|  Last chance, Swamp Giant! Tell us where you hid the Mini Queen!
Swamp Giant|  NEVER!!
Finn|  Huh?  Hi, Mini Queen! Jake! I've got 'er!
Jake|  Then hold my hand, dude!  Whoooop!
Swamp Giant|  Aaaah! Oof!
Finn|  My inflatable angel.
Jake|  Heh heh heh.  How's the Mini Queen?
Finn|  I dunno. Can't understand a word she says.  Aww! My pleasure, ma'am! I just like beating up evil!  Okay... Didn't... catch any of that either.
Jake|   Mini Queen must've stepped in somethin' funky.  No... It's not tiny feet I'm smelling! This way!  Whoa!
Finn|  What?
Jake|   Do you know whose sword this is?! This is the sword of Billy!
Finn|  Billy?!
Finn and Jake|   BIIILLYYYYYY!!!
Young Billy|  Nothung!
Finn|  Oh, yeah! That was the most mathematical thing ever!
Jake|  Oh, yeah! Hahaha! He fought a bear!
Finn|  This is so cool!
Finn and Jake|  Whoa!
Finn|  It's Billy's legendary crack!
Billy|   Hello.
Finn|   It's him! It's him!!
Jake|   I know, I know! Be cool!!
Billy|  Yep. It's me.
Finn|  Man! I'm such a huge nerd for you! Please take us on as hero apprentices!
Billy|  What for?
Finn|  So that we could learn to kick evil's butt... just like you!
Jake|  I wanna be the dog version of you!
Billy|  Ahh, that'd be a waste of time.
Jake|  Heh. Yeah. I-I'm a little paunchy... but I could do some sit-ups!
Billy|  No, I was talking about beating up monsters. It's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail.
Jake|  Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch!  Ah... ah...
Finn|"  What do you mean, ""pointless?"" We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster!"
Billy|  You know where she is right now? She's probably being eaten by a different monster. She's probably dead.  In my youth, I was much like you. Motivated. Headstrong. Wore a silly, little outfit. Even had a magic dog.
Jake|   Heh... I'm gonna pass out... 
Billy|  All my life, I've beaten on evil creatures.  But new evil keeps popping up. Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort!
Jake|  What other way is there?
Billy|  Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community.
Finn|  Nonviolently??  I gotta try being nonviolent... the Billy way...
Jake|  Me, too!
Finn|  Billy, I won't let you down!
Jake|  I love you, Billy! I got a secret crush on you, Billy!
Finn|  This is gonna be tough, Jake. I'll have to suppress my every warrior instinct.
Jake|  Relax. It'll be easy not to beat up on monsters and still help people.
Cobbler|  Help! Help!  A monster!  Oh! Thank goodness! Heroes! I'm being chased by a horrible Dragon! Please, please help!
Finn|  Oh, uh...
Jake|  Oh...
Cobbler|  Act quickly! He's almost upon us!
Jake|   Sorry. We don't beat stuff up anymore.
Cobbler|  No, but please! 
Finn|   Dude. We gotta do something to help him.
Jake|  I could teach 'im how to not be such a spaz.
Finn|   Hey, Mister. Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong?
Cobbler|  Well... I've been running all day. I guess I'm pretty hungry.
Jake|  Say no more.  Come on, Finn.
Cobbler|  Where're you going?!
Jake|  To make you somethin' to eat!
Cobbler|  AAAH!! NO!! HELP!!
Finn|  I still feel weird about not fighting off that dragon.
Jake|  Trust me. This is a way better way to help 'im.  Gruel! Get your free gruel!
Lady|   What's this all about?
Finn|  Free gruel, ma'am. I can't beat monster butts, but I can beat your hungry guts. That's for sure!
Lady|  Hahaha!  I didn't throw up! This gruel is very adequate.
Finn|   YEAH!!!
Finn|  This is great, Jake!
Jake|  Yeah, we're really helpin' people!
Finn|  Whoa! Look who it is!
Jake|  Dude! You're alive!
Cobbler|   No thanks to you two!! That dragon chased me for two days!! ...And then I was lost for... uh, three days... and then I... I fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for...  a week? So that's two, plus three, plus a week—
Jake|   Dude. Gruel.
Cobbler|  Oh, thank you!  Hahahaha! Hahaha.  AAAH! WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
Finn|  Huh?  Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe. It gives your body the power to grow armor.
Cobbler|  Wha? Ah... uh?!
Jake|  Dude... how much of that potion did you use?
Townsperson|  AAAAH!! MY TUMMY IS BREATHING FIRE!!!
Finn|   Geez... I thought people would like that.
Cobbler|  Why?! Why would anyone want that?!
Finn|  So you can defend against evil monsters!
Cobbler|  You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves!
Finn|  No, see? I'm helping you nonviolently!
Cobbler|  Helping?! I can't even move my hands! I'm a cobbler! How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?!
Finn|  Sooo... the village needs the help of a new cobbler, eh?
Finn and Jake|   Hmmmmmm...
Cobbler|  WHAT?! NO—
Finn|  Alright! We're cobblers!
Cobbler|  No, you're not!! You're just watching my shop while I go to the dermatologist!  And don't try to cobble anything!
Jake|"   What does ""cobble"" mean, anyway?"
Finn|  I think it has something to do with shoes...
Fine Lady|   Excuse me! Can you help me? I need a broken heel fixed. I'm going to a fancy funeral.
Finn|   Of course I'll help!
Finn|  There!  Whah!  Pa-kow!!
Fine Lady|  Ah!
Finn|  Now you can fight off evil if it shows up at the funeral!
Jake|   Did you fix that shoe with a magic nail?
Finn|  Maybe...  Whoa!
Jake|  Cool!
Fine Lady|  I cannot go to the funeral in these!
Cobbler|   Hey, everyone! I'm back from the doctor!  WHY?! 
Fine Lady|   ...And I'm not supposed to bring a guest.
Cobbler|   GET OUT!!
Finn|  Apparently, I suck at being nonviolent.
Jake|"  Dude, suckin' at somethin' is the first step towards bein' sorta good at somethin'. You and I are like little baby Billys right now, and we're ""sucking"" on our first bottle of nonviolent milk!"
Finn|"   Totes. I'll stop ""pooping"" my diaper."
Jake|  Whoa, what?!
Townsperson with fire-spitting belly button|  HELP! I NEED MEDICAL HELP!!
Finn|  Medical help? Hmmmmm...
Finn|  How can we help?
Lumpy Space Princess|  I want surgery to make my body hot.
Finn|  Yikes...
Lumpy Space Princess|  Yeah. I know I'm already pretty smokin'... but I bought this swimsuit, so I need a swimsuit body.
Jake|    You up for some serious plastic surgery?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Aw, yeah! This body's hot! And powerful!  Huh?! Aw, what?! 
Jake|  Dude, did you use a magic nail again?
Finn|  I've got three left!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Ohhhh...  What did you do to me??
Finn|  We transformed you into a cyborg fighter! That's hot, right?
Lumpy Space Princess|  No one thinks this look is hot!!
Cobbler|   Oh, my laces! You're the most beautiful— 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Huh?!
Finn|  ...Jake...?
Jake|  ....Yeah...?
Finn|  I think us being nonviolent... is hurting people. Man... Billy is gonna be so bummed out...
Jake|  Not if we run away, Finn! We'll have to live in halfway homes and be cannibals! We'll survive!
Finn|  I just wanna sit here and moan.
Jake|  Then I'll moan with ya, buddy.
Finn|   Thaaaanks, buuuddy...
Jake|   Yoooouuu'rrre weeeelcooome...
Old Lady|  AAAH! AAAH! HELP ME!!
Swamp Giant|  Hahaha! Relax! I'm just gonna grind you up!!
Old Lady|  AAAH! AAAH!
Jake|   Aw, man, this grass-bag again??  HEY, EVIL-DOER!  Um... could you keep your evil-doing quiet? Finn is dealing with some heavy stuff over here.
Swamp Giant|  It's not evil!! When they get this old, they wanna be ground up!! Hahaha! Right, you old bat?!
Old Lady|  Help!!
Swamp Giant|  Right?!?
Old Lady|  Oooh!! Aaah!!
Finn|  Huh?? A fist raised in righteous anger?! Oh, no! It's my fist!! I've gotta think of a way to save this old lady without punchin' this guy in the face!! Hmmm...
Swamp Giant|   Yeah, you wanna get ground up, right?!?
Finn|   WRONG!!!!   I couldn't think of anything...
Old Lady|  Whooo! 
Finn|  POOP!! I saved her with violence...
Old Lady|  What's your huff, son?
Finn|  The greatest hero in the world told me to help people without being violent... and I promised I would do that and not let him down... but I did let 'im down.
Old Lady|  Stuff and nonsense! You sure helped this old gal out! And you did it with violence! Like a true hero, you were born to punch evil creatures!  Just like I was born to be an old lady! Don't deny your rowdy nature, paladins!  And don't take advice from old people! 
Finn|  Yeah... Yeah...! YEAH!! That old lady has a point!
Jake|  Wait, didn't she say not to take advice from old peo—
Finn|  It's all so clear to me! Back to the cave of Billy!!
Jake|  Cha!!
Finn|  It's us again.
Jake|  And we've got exciting news!
Billy|  Aw, I don't—I don't wanna buy anything.
Finn|  Billy, an old lady told me that I shouldn't listen to you because you're old. Also, that I should do what I was born to do... which is kickin' buns.
Billy|  Don't you see how pointless it is? You know what's probably happening to that old lady right now? She's probably dead!
Jake|  She's right here. 
Old Lady|  Hello!
Finn|  We saved 'er, Billy.
Jake|  You saved 'er.
Finn|  I saved 'er, Billy. I saved 'er using violence. And that's not a bad thing, Billy! This old lady is alive because of these!  And look how happy she is, man! She's elated!
Billy|  Hmm. Perhaps you're right.  It's... it's as if your words are filling a void in my very being... You wanna watch?  Nothung!  Finn and Jake... truly, you are my heroes.  Now you're freakin' me out... 
Jake|  We're his heroes!!
Billy|  Huh... Hello.
Jake|  Ha! Haha! I love you, Billy!!
Billy|  Get outta here!!
Finn|  Poor Finn Sword. I'm sorry, man.  Everything's broken.
BMO| No, it's not! It's still good. Five seconds rule.
Jake| I don't know what to do.
Princess Bubblegum| This is hecka serious. Did you try making feel-better-waffles?
Jake|" Yeah, but he just keeps dropping them on the ground, and we're all like, ""It's still good. Look."""
Princess Bubblegum| Well, yeah, five-second rule. Jake, I think it's time for you to activate plan C.
Jake|  Plan C? Are you sure?
Princess Bubblegum| Yes. He's all jefferied up in the dome piece. We can't let it spread any further.
Jake| You're right.
Jake| Plan C, activate. Plan C, plan C,... Aha. Bingo. Hmm.
Princess Bubblegum|  Hello?
Jake| What's plan C, again? Something about music?
Finn|  Poor Finn Sword. I'm sorry, man. What the heck is that? It's gonna distract me from my sword staring. Better track down the source and kill it.
Susan Strong|  ♪I'm gonna fly, fly like an eagle. With the power of myself, constant pain. I'm gonna climb, every mountain. Get the dust off my shelf, ohh...♪ oh, hold on, hold on, can susan get more bass in the monitor?
Jake| You got it, Sooz. Oh, hey buddy.
BMO| We are going live in five!
Finn| What is this? A concert?
Jake|" Even better. It's a ""Battle of the Bands""!"
Princess Bubblegum| And guess who the special celebrity guest judge is?
Finn| Donny?
Jake| No! You are!
Jake & Princess Bubblegum| It's working.
Princess Bubblegum|" Good afternoon and welcome to plan C -- I mean, ""Battle of the Bands"". Now, let's all give a warm welcome to our celebrity guest judge!"
Ice King| Hey, yo, my man, no photos.
Princess Bubblegum| Please welcome our first contestants to the stage, Emcee Neptr and Flame P.
Ice King| Huh? Wha-? Where am I? Gunter?
Ice King| Gunter?
Ice King| I don't think this is Gunter.
Lumpy Space Princess| It's me, Ice King.
Ice King| Lumpy Space Princess?
Lumpy Space Princess| Yeah.
Ice King| And you're doing this because you like me?
Lumpy Space Princess| No, Ice King, listen. I'm gonna give you the straight dope.
Ice King| Okay.
Lumpy Space Princess| You're weird and old and you kidnap princesses.
Ice King| I know!
Lumpy Space Princess| But I asked you here tonight because I wanna know what you think of this.
Ice King|"  ""The Prince Who Wanted Everything; A Fionna and Cake Adventure""? Hey, why isn't my name on there?"
Lumpy Space Princess| I want you to read it because you're their dad. Please be their dad right now and bring them to life!
Ice King|  Okay, might as well...at least until the cops show up. Ahem!
Ice King| Once upon a time, there was a most handsome prince, the future king of Lumpy Space, Lumpy Space Prince.
Lumpy Servants| Where do you want these gold-plated sandwiches your highness?
Lumpy Space Prince|  By the window!
Lumpy Space Princess| No!  That's not how I sound! Read it in a better voice!
Ice King| Okay, Okay! Yeesh! 
Lumpy Space Prince|  By the window!
Lumpy Space Prince| For from the window shall I shower the poor with presents, as is my altruistic nature. Haha!
Lumpy Space Prince| Eat! Eat, my children!
Lumpy Space Queen| Son, come here at once!
Ice King| But, all was not perfect for this philanthropic prince of the people.
Ice King| His parents were slobbering monsters who didn't care that he was a beautiful prince! They wanted him to be a monster too.
Lumpy Space Queen| Why aren't you working on your monster exercises?
Lumpy Space Prince| I don't want to be a monster.
Lumpy Space King| Eat these worms!
Lumpy Space Prince| No!
Lumpy Space Queen| You will eat them!
Lumpy Space Prince| I won't eat them!
Lumpy Space Queen| Sharpen your teeth!
Lumpy Space Prince| No!
Lumpy Space King| Eat these worms!
Lumpy Space Queen| Eat those worms and sharpen those teeth!
Lumpy Space Prince| No, no, no! I told you hundreds of times that I don't want to be a monster, and there's nothing you can do about it!
Lumpy Space Prince| Where am I? 
Lumpy Space Prince| Who's there? Reveal yourself!
Lumpy Space Prince| Hmm... Citizens of this realm, I am the one and only heir to the throne of the Lumpy Space Kingdom- I mean, I used to be. I rebelled against my parents, and now i'm a refugee.  What's that? You wish to help me? I am touched! Fetch me some clothes and I'll pay you handsomely, by petting you. First, I need freaky clothes! Cool freaky, not monster freaky. Oh yes, and something to read as well, something mind-blowing.
Lumpy Space Prince| Oh wait! I also need servants! Recruit some locals, they work fine.
Lumpy Space Prince| Hmm... Not bad! Well done, my child! Next!
Lumpy Space Prince| Massenpsychologie und Ich-Analyse. That does sound mind-blowing!
Fionna| Yah! Aiyah! Aha!
Fionna| Cake, I'll save the captives, you take care of those animals! 
Cake| Ya!
Cake| Ha! Dance you puppets!
Fionna| You're free to go people!
Flame Prince, Turtle Prince, Marshal Lee, and Prince Gumball| Woohoo!
Lumpy Space Prince| Hey! Those were my servants!
Fionna| Hmm?
Lumpy Space Prince| What an innocent face!  It shines as if you have done no wrong! Do you like my freaky clothes?
Fionna|  I don't care about your clothes!
Lumpy Space Princess| Hey! You're not supposed to read it like that. Say it in a nicer way!
Ice King| I...Uh...I don't-
Fionna|  -care about you're clothes.
Lumpy Space Prince| You don't?  Finally, someone who's not impressed with my noble looks, but admire's what's inside of me!
Lumpy Space Prince| Is this really happening? You're clothes are so raggedy and soiled! And yet, you use them as a napkin!  You care not about your personal appearance nor hygiene!
Lumpy Space Prince| Dress me in the fashion of this peasant!
Lumpy Space Prince| I have much to learn from you, Fionna the Human.
Cake| How'd he know your name?
Lumpy Space Prince| Hmm... Your movements are so free! My parents only want me to fly like a proper monster stiff and rigid, with a sharp toothed scowl permanently in place. But now, I see a new way to move.  Dance with me?
Cake| Y'all seeing those big floaty faces?
Fionna|  Pretty!
Lumpy Space Prince| Uh...No!
Lumpy Space Prince| Release!
Fionna|  Uh... What just happened?
Lumpy Space Prince| You were under my handsome spell for a moment. We can never marry, you know? I can only be with someone who is my equal in every way , a person so much like me that she doesn't even exist!
Fionna| I don't care, as long as we can hang out! Anyone want a sandwich?
Lumpy Space Prince| Ooh! I'll have one!
Lumpy Space Prince| So rusty... So humble...
Lumpy Space Prince| Delightful!
Lumpy Space Prince| Wait, where're your baby tables?
Lumpy Space Prince| What!?  You don't dip your foods in gold before eating?
Fionna| Who eats gold?
Lumpy Space Prince| Great Glob! What is this? So charming! So quaint! So self-reliant!
Lumpy Space Prince|  For years, I thought only of the needs of my people, but what about me? What do I need? This poorly made sandwich has enlightened me!
Lumpy Space Prince| What I want is to be like you, Fionna the peasant! And I'll need you as my pet, Cake the cat.
Cake| Yeah, whatever.
Lumpy Space Prince|  Huh?
Lumpy Space Queen| Son!
Lumpy Space Prince| Flee, noble Fionna, for it is my stupid parents! And they're fatter than ever!
Lumpy Space Queen| Silence!
Lumpy Space Prince| Ahh! I'm just being honest!
Lumpy Space Prince| Huh?
Fionna| Come on, you beautiful dandy! Only your pure spirit can defeat your evil family!
Fionna| And this sword!
Lumpy Space Prince| You're right, Fionna! This is my destiny!
Lumpy Space Prince| I do have the power!
Lumpy Space Prince| Huh?
Lumpy Space Prince| Fionna!
Lumpy Space Queen| You must obey!
Lumpy Space Prince| My heart!
Lumpy Space Queen| Submit young one, become a true monster.
Lumpy Space Prince| No! It isn't right!
Lumpy Space Queen| Silence!
Lumpy Space Prince| Urh, Fionna, This is the end for me. But at least I made you proud, didn't I?
Fionna| I don't care. 
Lumpy Space Prince| My glob, Fionna! You've been telling be the answer all along!  The only way to defeat parental disapproval is not caring about anything! I don't care!
Lumpy Space Prince| I don't care!
Fionna| LSP!
Cake| Haha! Cake's helping!
Lumpy Space Prince| I don't care...
Lumpy Space Queen| Thank you son! You freed us from adult mediocrity and fatuousness.
Lumpy Space Prince|  I don't care!
Lumpy Space Prince| Fionna, Cake. Both of you buy me dinner.
Fionna and Cake| Yes, your hotness!
Ice King| And then, Lumpy Space Prince became so real that he can actually break through into this plane of existence. Woah!  And meet his one true love, Lumpy Space Princess. It was really happening. The secret portal began to shake and tremble.
Ice King| The countdown began. 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...
Ice King| 4, 3, 2, 1!
Finn|  Hey, fart-face!!
Ice King|  Huh?
Finn|  Unhand Princess Bubblegum!!
Ice King|  Foolish interlopers! Zah! 
Finn|   Whoa!  Ah!
Ice King|  Ee hee hee hee—OOH!  MY EYESIGHT!
Princess Bubblegum|  Huh? Hee hee hee!
Finn|  Hey, Ice King! I bet you'll never kiss the princess!
Ice King|  I will kiss her! I will!  Hold still.  Mwah!
Finn|   You just kissed Jake's butt!
Ice King|  What?!  EEEEGH!!   The hour is yours, but the day shall be mine! Just like you, Princess—MINE!
Princess Bubblegum|  What a patoot. Thanks for saving the day yet again, boys.
Finn|  You're welcome, Princess.  Uh... 
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm gonna throw you two a party. Meet at the Candy Kingdom—TONIGHT!
Jake|  That paper crane for Princess Bubblegum?
Finn|  I just thought I'd bring 'er a gift... in return for throwing us this party.
Jake|  Heh. I bet you wish you were my butt.
Finn|  What?
Jake|  I bet you wish you were my butt, because then the princess would... No, wait... I bet you wish you were the Ice King and the princess was my butt!
Finn|  What?!
Jake|  Hmm...  OH! I bet you wish Bubblegum would kiss you, too! Like the Ice King and my butt! Hahahaha!
Finn|  That's ridiculous!  Huh? Uggghhh!!  What's so funny?
Peppermint Butler|  Hey, everybody. Finn and Jake are here.
Jake|  Who's ready to party?!
Finn|  What's everyone laughing at?
Wildberry Princess|  Shh!
Ricardio|"  Stand back, everyone. This style of massage is called, ""Best Friend Massage."""
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, my gosh...
Ricardio|  Because it can only be done for friends. It is completely consensual.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, holy cow...
Ricardio|  Relax yourself now, Lumpy Space Princess... YAH! 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh! I feel so great!
Finn|  Who is that guy?
Ricardio|  Hahaaa!
Princess Bubblegum|  Greetings, party-goers! Glad you could all make it!
Finn|  Princess Bubblegum!  Princess. I just wanted to thank you for—
Lumpy Space Princess|   Oh, my gosh! PB, ya gotta check out this super cute guy. You're gonna love 'im. 
Finn|  Uhhh...
Lumpy Space Princess|  This is... Oh. Oh, my gosh. I don't even know your name.
Ricardio|  Ricardio. Ricardio at your service. I've been waiting all evening to meet you, Princess.  Mwah!  I've heard you appreciate ancient technology. Have you ever used the balbaflonic laser to align the hybernotalist rift in the bubaflon plasmodial formation?
Princess Bubblegum|  Whoa! No, I haven't!  Wanna continue this conversation on the dance floor?
Ricardio|   It would be my pleasure, Princess.
Finn|  Why didn't the princess invite me to dance?
Jake|  If you wanna dance, just go dance!
Finn|  But now she's dancing with him! Ah... I feel... weird!
Jake|  Huh, it sounds like you're dealing with some new emotions you don't understand... like jealousy.
Finn|  BLAAAARGH!!
Jake|  Look, man, just go out there and get down! 
Ricardio|   —transmordial layers completely independent of the babylons. Eh?
Princess Bubblegum|  Wow! That would mean that the babylons would fluctuate with the piranha-nanosphere!
Ricardio|  Correct!
Finn|  Agh!  They're talkin' about science, man! I can't compete with that!
Jake|  Do the Science Dance! Remember it? It was sorta like this.  Wah unh we ah eeh...
Finn|  You think that'll work?
Jake|  Yeah! Probably.  Do it, man! You're a pro!
Finn|   Science Dance! Science Dance!
Ricardio|   —lower proximities to—
Finn|  Science Dance! Hey, eh, Princess! You wanna spend some time with me?
Ricardio|  Excuse me, Princess. You must excuse me. 
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, uh... Alright!  Finn, what the cabbage? I was learning about Zanoits!
Finn|   Oh... I'm... into Zanoits! Th-They're the best!
Princess Bubblegum|  Zanoits kill hundreds of thousands of Plantoids a year.
Finn|  Oh, no, not the Plantoids!
Princess Bubblegum|  Plantoids produce mellotoxin!  Mellotoxin kills Zanoits!!
Finn|  ...So are Zanoits... good things?
Princess Bubblegum|   You're totally jealous of Ricardio.
Finn|  No, I'm not. I just don't like the way he talks to you. It makes me feel weird.
Princess Bubblegum|  That's jealousy, hun.
Finn|  I'm not jealous! I'M WEIRD!!!
Jake|   Woof! Man... This is goin' bad. Hey, Finn. You gotta come help me slay these peanut monsters at the bar. It can't wait.  Wow, man, what happened out there?
Finn|  Agh... I don't know! I was tryin' to warn 'er, but she twisted my words around and—
Jake|  Yeah. Ladies are twisty, man. Bubblegum's super smart, too.
Finn|  I know! And I can't shake this weird feeling about Ricardio. I think he's... a villain.
Jake|  Why? Is it because his face is so foldy and dramatic?
Finn|  No! I can just feel it in my gut! He's up to something sinister!
Jake|  Maybe what you feel is romantic rivalry.
Finn|  I'll prove he's a villain!
Jake|  How?
Finn|  Stakeout.
Finn|  Here he comes!  They're talking!
Jake|"  Lemme see.  I can read their lips.  ""Hey, shorty, you should pick your boogers and then fart!""  ""You look kind of like a big pink baguette!"""
Finn|   Get serious, Jake!! This is life and death!
Jake|  Is it? Don't get me wrong. I'm all about stakeouts and spying on this guy, but what if he's not a villain? What if he just looks wicked? Some people look wicked but are super nice.
Finn|  I gotta trust my gut!
Jake|   Hmm.
Finn|  He's on the move! Let's roll!  I see 'im. He's holding rope and going into the trash. He's smashing bottles—and pretending to stab someone!
Jake|  So... he's recycling... or what?
Finn|   I think your gut's a little naive, Jake.  Holy moly! He's... he's with the Ice King! They're shouting something!  Ricardio is tossing him in the dumpster and running away!
Jake|  So I was right! He is a good guy who's just cursed to look suspicious!  You and me, gut! Together forever! Solvin' crimes and makin' up rhymes!
Finn|  No way. This proves he's a super-villain! More powerful than lesser villains like the Ice King!
Finn|  Then it's settled! We're gonna confront Ricardio face-to-face and prove he's evil!
Jake|  Or good!
Ricardio|  Oof!
Finn|  So what're you doin', Ricardio? Are you evil?
Jake|  Or nice with an evil face?
Ricardio|  That's none of your business.
Finn|  The safety of Princess Bubblegum is my business!
Jake|  Yeah, we just wanna know if you're evil or not.
Ricardio|  Oh, yeah?
Finn & Jake|  Yeah.
Ricardio|  Oh, yeah?
Jake|  Yeah.  Yes!
Finn|  You stay away from Princess Bubblegum with all that stuff!
Ricardio|  Now that my plan is nearly complete, there is no way you could stop me.
Finn|  I could stop you if I wanted!
Ricardio|  Oh, yeah?
Finn|  Yeah!
Ricardio|  Oh, yeah??
Finn|  YEEEAAAH!!!
Princess Bubblegum|   What's going on here?
Finn|  Princess?!
Princess Bubblegum|  Ricardio?!
Ricardio|   Yes... I'm alright, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn... why'd you do it?
Finn|  He was gonna hurt you with those ropes and bottles!
Princess Bubblegum|  These were for our balbaflonic laser.
Ricardio|  It's not all his fault, Princess. I might've looked a little threatening.
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn... you shouldn't punch brainiacs. You know how fragile they are! You gotta stop this jealous business.
Finn|  But...
Princess Bubblegum|  C'mon, Ricardio. I'll patch you up and give you candy. 
Finn|   She hates me now. I was totally wrong about Ricardio.
Ice King|  No, Finn!  You were not wrong. He is evil! 
Finn|  Ice King! What do you know about this? Tell me or I'll do something!
Jake|  Hold up, Finn! The Ice King looks sorta damaged!
Finn|  I don't care! I only care about Ricardio!
Ice King|  But my enervated condition has everything to do with him.  I was trying to cast a spell that would give me total control of Princess Bubblegum's heart! ...But I messed it all up... and lost control of mine.  He planned to rip out Princess Bubblegum's heart... to make it his bride.  Without my heart, I grew weak.  But I made my way to the Candy Kingdom to look for him. In an alleyway, I begged him to  return to me and leave the princess alone.  But he threw me in the dumpster and left me for dead.  Stop Ricardio!
Finn|   Agh! Come on, Jake!  Gotta save the princess!
Jake|  Princess Bubblegum!!
Finn|  Princess!! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn!! Jake!!
Ricardio|  You were right all along, Finn! Now I'm going to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart and make out with it!
Finn|  Not if I can help it!
Ricardio|  One step closer and I'll remove her heart!!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn! I feel like a big idiot for doubting you! He was just so engaging! ...But his knowledge on plantoids is actually pretty weak.
Ricardio|  Shut your mouth up, Princess!  I'm gonna smooch that heart!! It will be my bride!!
Finn|  Why don't you marry someone your own size?! Like my foot?!
Ricardio|  Huh?!
Finn|  And my fist?!
Ice King|   Stop! Stop it! That's my heart, you piece of—
Finn|  Ice King.  Should we... let 'im take his heart back? He is... villainous...
Jake|  I don't wanna watch an old man die on Princess Bubblegum's carpet, man.
Ice King|  Oh, yeah...
Ricardio|  Wait! Wait! No!
Ice King|  Come to daddy...
Ricardio|  Noooooooooo!
Ice King|  Yeah, there you go...  Like that? Huh?
Ricardio|   Seeee you guys laterrrr...
Ice King|   I feel wonderful! Hahaha! And now that I've saved the Princess, she'll marry me and live in my dungeon every day!
Finn|  No, she won't!
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeah, no, I won't!
Ice King|  Yes you WILL!  Well... maybe not today... or tomorrow... but another day! Another—
Princess Bubblegum|  Thanks again for saving me... again.
Finn|   Don't mention it.
Princess Bubblegum|  Now that Ricardio's gone, you don't have to be jealous of anyone anymore. 
Finn|  I never get jealous.
Princess Bubblegum|   Kiss me, Finn.  Ahem.  I mean... kiss me, Finn.  Am I doing it right, Jake?
Finn|  NOOOOOOOO!!!
Lumpy Space Princess| OH MY GLOB!
Viola| Time is a slippery devil. Our lives are sudden. They come and go like like a Summer Shower.
Finn|   Whew. A goblet of sparkling apple juice for milady.
Princess Bubblegum|  Thanks, Finn. Hey where'd you get this goblet?
Finn|  Oh, uh, I think we won it in a fight with an octopus we were fighting in, like, a sea cave full of treasure?
Jake|  No. It was from when BMO was playing dress-up.
Princess Bubblegum|  It reminds me of a cup my uncle used to have.
Finn|  You mean your Uncle Gumbald, right?
Jake| Do tell. You never talk about your family.
Princess Bubblegum|  I don't know. Families are tricky. You guys know what I mean, right?  We have to go back a ways Like 800 years ago.
Young Bubblegum|  
Goblin|  Help! Help me! Oh, goodness me. Someone please help me. I'm a defenseless little goblin surrounded by all this loot. Boo-hoo.
Young Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, you poor thing, here. Have a drink to ease your nerves while I untie you.
Goblin| Pfft! Aah! The time for faking is over now. Give me all your stuff.
Goblin|  What? You brought a peashooter to a techno-harpoon fight?!  Aah!   Aah-aah-aaah!
Young Bubblegum|  Another close call today, Neddy.
Neddy|  
Young Bubblegum|  Neddy, you sweet chicken.  It was a lot different back in the Mother Gum. We all had each other's backs. I'm going to make more of us, Neddy. I know you don't care, and that's fine. But I need to be around people like me.
Young Bubblegum|  O-kay! This is it, Neddy. We're getting relatives!
Young Bubblegum|   It worked! Your name is Aunt Lolly!
Lolly|  A pleasure to meet you, dear.
Young Bubblegum|   And you're Cousin Chicle. You're a full 2.3 meters tall.
Cousin Chicle|  Naturally I am a gentleman of high standing.
Young Bubblegum|  Oh, Cousin Chicle. And finally Uncle Gumbald! This is your favorite mug.
Uncle Gumbald| Ah, yes.  I'm your GREAT uncle. The mug proclaims it so.
Young Bubblegum|  Aren't they great, Neddy? You'll be my protectors, my advisers, my family.
Neddy|  
Young Bubblegum|  I'm heading out, Neddy.  What? What? What?!
Uncle Gumbald|  Morning, small niece.
Young Bubblegum|  Uncle Gumbald, the taffy trees are gone!
Uncle Gumbald|"  I know. I chopped 'em down last night.  Yesterday, I realized these trees were not being utilized to their full potential, so I elected to build this cabin. This is but the first step in building my glorious new candy city. I've already drawn up the plans for it. All of this will be apartments. And did you notice the family crest I designed? It's a ""G"" for, uh ""Gum""."
Young Bubblegum|  Why does it look like your head?
Uncle Gumbald|   You're such a curious little girl. We're a lifestyle brand now.
Young Bubblegum|  Success! Now instead of worrying about his dumb city, Uncle can come here to picnic, swim, and, uh fish!
Young Bubblegum|    Welcome to life, Candyfish.
Candy Fish|   I can't breathe air!
Uncle Gumbald|  Bonnie! What have you done to my building site?
Young Bubblegum|  I made us a butterscotch lake and a fish to live in it.
Uncle Gumbald|  But that's where the gift shop was gonna go.Now it's just gonna be volleyballs, water skis, and shrimp cocktails.
Candy Fish|  Sounds nice.
Uncle Gumbald|"  Did you say you ""made"" this creature?"
Young Bubblegum|  Come on. You'll appreciate him more once you watch him swim around.
Uncle Gumbald|  Bonnibel you've micromanaged me for the last time.  Huh? Hmm. I think it's time for Bonnie to be re-branded.
Uncle Gumbald|  Niece, now that I've had to stare at it for weeks, I've got to admit that your lake was a very good idea.
Lolly|  Ja! Sehr gut!
Chicle|  Very wunderbar.
Young Bubblegum|  Oh, I'm so happy.
Uncle Gumbald|  We got you a gift to say thanks. It's right outside, Prinzessin.
Young Bubblegum|   You got me a car?
Uncle Gumbald|  Yes, a car. But also a boyfriend!
Mr. Cream Puff|  Hi, babe.Beep beep!
Young Bubblegum|  Wait, what?
Uncle Gumbald|  All right, you nut. Have fun on your date.
Young Bubblegum|  Date?!
Mr. Cream Puff|  Let's go, babe. Beep beep!
Uncle Gumbald|  What a naive little child.
Mr. Cream Puff|  Date's over, babe. Pick you up tomorrow to get matching tattoos.
Young Bubblegum|  I'm back from that terrible date. Hello?
Uncle Gumbald|"  Thank you for coming to the mandatory optimization meeting. Tonight, we address the ""Bonnie problem""."
Young Bubblegum|  Bonnie problem?
Uncle Gumbald|  Our future city is on course to be a rousing success, barring only one obstacle Our complete lack of competent leadership.
 Both Uncle Gumbald And Aunt Lolly together|  Oh, Cousin Chicle! Oh, Cousin Chicle!
Young Bubblegum|  Dang, Chicle, that's cold.
Uncle Gumbald|  I have formulated a happy juice that will render her as docile and simple-minded as her cutie BF, young Mr.Creampuff.
Young Bubblegum|  
Uncle Gumbald|  All we have to do is sprinkle some of this on her breakfast, and we'll be in charge.Let us celebrate with coup d'etat cupcakes.
Chicle|  Poisoned cakes. 
Crunchy|  Where am I?
Lolly|  Oh, right, the poison. 
Manfried|  I don't know what's happening! Whee! Whee! Whee! Whee!
Uncle Gumbald|  Ah! My first candy employees.
Young Bubblegum|  What have you done? This isn't what I made you to be.
Uncle Gumbald|  No, you wanted us to be lowly pet fish, swimming in your narcissistic pond. But I am your equal!
Young Bubblegum|  You're not like me. You're bad.
Uncle Gumbald|  I am the future. Come on, Bonnie. Don't run away from happiness. I'm going to fix you. And then, I'm going to fix that sniveling gumwad, Neddy.
Young Bubblegum|  Don't touch my brother! 
Uncle Gumbald|  A pea-shooter?  The juice! Nooooo!
Punch Bowl|  Hey! Where's the party? 
Young Bubblegum|   What a mess. But they do seem happier now So unburdened and pliable. You, the crunchy ball, dance for me.
Crunchy|  Sure.  Come on, lady. Do the crunchy dance.
Young Bubblegum|  Oh, Crunchy. Sure, I'll dance with my candy people.
Crunchy|  Yay for the lady!
Young Princess Bubblegum|  Call me Princess.
Everybody|  Hurrah!
Finn|  Whoa, for real?
Princess Bubblegum|  Like I said, families are tricky.  BMO! Where did you get this cup?
BMO|  From that guy! The guy on the cup! The guy who's face is on the cup! That guy!
Gunther|   Stop, demon! Get back here, I say! Ha ha, nowhere to run. I, the great and powerful Urgence Evergreen, command you to freeze into a million pieces and leave young Gunther alone!
Gunther| Foolish demon, you leave me no choice. Zap, zap zap zap zap! What?
Gunther|  No, Nina! You're supposed to be frozen. Nina!
Gunther| Nina, the portals! The Elementals are gathering! C'mon, you blockhead!
Chatsberry| I just think we should discuss this, Evergreen.
Evergreen|" ""Discuss""?! Are you listening, Chatsberry? Once this comet hits, everybody dies. Not just everybody, but us, but us!"
Balthus| Now, now, hold on, Evergreen. Hath not a comet impacted our world every thousand years with no lasting grievousness?
Evergreen| Ahh, but this, Balthus, is no ordinary comet. Behold!
Evergreen| See how it writhes? It aches for our extinction. It—!
Chatsberry| But Evergreen, even if the comet is as dangerous as you say, what can we possibly do?
Evergreen| We build a crown.
Chatsberry|" ""A crown""?"
Evergreen| Like none seen before, or ever after! A magical crown whose phantasmal circuitry will bond to its first bearer and grant him his one deepest wish...  to destroy the hideous comet which threatens our world! The good news is I already built the crown. The bad news it needs a power source.  The enchanted Ruby Eyes of the ancient lava dog, Magwood! And that's where you come in.
Chatsberry| Wait, wait! Evergreen, please. Wish Magic is really the real deal! This wish may see things in you you cannot see yourself. Can you truly say you know your heart's truest desire?
Balthus| I'm with Chatsberry. If this comet hits, we four indeed may perish. But the Elements we embody — Fire, Ice, Candy, and Slime — will live on! But a misplaced wish could cause irreversible damage to the very structure of existence!
Evergreen| Well, that's just great. What about you, Slimy D?
Slimy D|  Yo, yo. My name's Slimy D, and I'm here to—
Balthus|  Slimy D stands with us.
Chatsberry| We reject your plan, Urgence Evergreen!
Evergreen| Very well then. You leave me no choice.
Chatsberry| Urgence! Stop! You'll doom us... all!
Evergreen| Ingrate! Hmm! Doom you to no doom, maybe!  Gunther!  Pack my things, Gunther. We ride forth with Mount Magwood. You get to watch me save the world!  Gunther!  Come on, Gunther. Get your head in the game.
Gunther| Sorry, Master Evergreen. 
Evergreen|  And he expects me to teach him the ways of magic? As if.
Gunther|  Ouch! Oof! OUCH! Uh, Master Evergreen? Can I ride on the palanquin with you? My feet are soft.  No, you're right. Ooh, boy...
Gunther|  Gettin' fat.  Gettin' fat, right?
Evergreen| Hmm. 
Gunther| However, I would suggest this is still a nice night. It's quiet.
Evergreen| Hmm, it is quiet. Why don't you put on some music? The chimes, Gunther.
Gunther| Okay.
Evergreen|" Gunther! I said ""chimes""! Gunther, no! "
Gunther| Sorry, Master, I'll put him back.
Ice Imp| Heeeeey! Mmm, what?
Evergreen| Oh, never mind.  Here, take the jar and find me some water. There's not enough moisture in the air for me to make an ice camp.
Gunther| Uh, Master? I'm sorry, I don't think I've seen any water at all today.
Evergreen| Just do it. Don't anger Daddy.
Gunther| Wait, are you my father?
Evergreen| No, but I stole your egg and mutated your brain—get going! 
Gunther| Hmm.
Gunther| Heh, you don't know where you're going, do you, girl?  Ah, you're good at this.  Man, you know who I like? Master Evergreen. He can do anything; one thing he's gonna do—he said he's gonna teach me magic. I can be like him!
Gunther| Nina, no!
Gunther| Master Evergreen, I found the water so you could build a—oh,  I guess he also found water, too.
Ice Imp|  Heeeeey?!
Evergreen| Now, Gunther, listen to me. Don't follow me into Magwood's lair or else he'll melt your dome!
Gunther|  Yeah...
Evergreen|  Oh, Gunther! You should see this!
Gunther| Okay!
Evergreen|  Gunther, no! You failed; he'll melt your dome.
Evergreen|  Not as grand as you once were, eh?
Gunther| Master Evergreen, I'm sorry, but I got worried. Yeeeee!!
Gunther| Ah! Oh, boy! Uh, maybe maybe maybe, maybe I can do magic!  Like Master Evergreen. Bah! Ice! Flah, sorry... 
Gunther| Shh!
Ice Imp| That's what you get!  Heeeey....
Evergreen|  Ice!  
Evergreen| This is why I don't teach you magic.
Gunther|  Niiina, Hiiina, Iiiina, Fiiina—
Evergreen| Gunther! The heck are you doing?! Get in here, Gunther! Oh, there you are, you blockhead. Quickly, take your position. We have precious little time. Once I complete the bonding chant, you deactivate the force field.  Bonding, bonding, three two one, you can do it, you can do it, three two one, bonding bonding. I did it! I—  Come on, now, what did I ever do to you?!  Watch the columns, stupid! Whoops!  Easy now...  Oh, wow, did you see that?!  Ow, my bread balls!
Evergreen| Gunther?! Gunther, can you hear me?!
Gunther|  Yeah—yes, Master Evergreen!
Evergreen| Okay, good. Now, aiming at the sound of my voice, throw the crown so it lands right on the top of my head.
Gunther| I—wait, what?
Evergreen| No, no, there's no time! It must be you, Gunther!
Gunther| Me?
Evergreen| Don't worry, it's easy. Even a mush-head like you couldn't donk it up too bad. Just focus on your deepest truest wish, the destruction of the deadly comet, and the rest will take care of itself.
Gunther|  My deepest truest wish...  Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no!
Evergreen| Gunther? Buddy? What are you wishing for down there?  Gunther... no... That's the wrong wish! You've got to snap out of it! Use a concentration spell or, or a basic focusing charm—like I taught you... I mean, like I meant to teach you... I--
Gunther| Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no!
Ice King| Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, no! Gunther, noooooo! . Mornin'. Man, what a dream. Do you guys ever have the dino-boy dream with the astero-- what? What... what is it?  Something in my teeth? Something in my hair? Something in my nose? Something in my ear?
Cookie|  Donkin' Princess...
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, okay. How about I give you a big cowboy hat? Then will you let the hostages go?
Cookie|  No... no!  Don't play games with me, Princess. I want that crown. No crown, no hostages.
Princess Bubblegum| Well, obviously that's going to be a problem, because I'm the princess and I need my crown. So...
Cookie| No, Princess! You are problem—the problem princess!  Just gimme that crown! 
Jake| Why does he want your crown anyway, Princess?
Finn| Yeah, what's his beef?
Princess Bubblegum| I don't know, guys—he's crazy. He's left me no choice. I'm sending in the banana guards. It's about to turn crazy nasty.  Hello. Captain Banana Guard?
Jake|  Wait a second, Princess. Why don't me and Finn just sneak in there incognito and neutralize the threat, old-fashioned spy guy-style?
Princess Bubblegum| Hmm. Okay, but if you guys aren't out of there by  400, I'm sending in the guards.
Jake|  Okay, I was thinkin' I could  dress up like a mailman.
Finn| Yeah. Yeah, and I could wear all black and I could be like, you know, like, your shadow.
Princess Bubblegum| Hmm. I can't really see that working.
Jake| Yeah, the shadow thing might be pushin' it.
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, no-no-no, that part's fine. I was talking about you dressing up like a mailman.
Jake| What? But I always wanted to be a mailman.
Princess Bubblegum| Nah, you don't look like a mailman. You look like a milkman. Let's get you a proper milkman outfit.
Jake| You ready?
Finn| Yeah. Let's bust it.
Jake| Hello.
Cookie|" ""Hello""?! Who the heck are you?  I'm gonna smash your face."
Jake| Uhh, milkman, sir. I brought the milk—for the hostages, sir.
Cookie| Huh? Oh. I thought maybe you were a spy guy or somethin'. Go ahead, give everyone some milk, then get the math outta here.
Jake| Yes, sir.  Milk, sir?
Marshmallow| Thanks.
Jake| Milk?
Candy Person #103| Thanks.
Jake| Milk?
Marc| Thank you.
Jake|  Some milk?
Finn|" Psst! Get ready, Jake. When we get to the cookie, you throw some milk in his face and yell, ""Alvin's hot juice box. Alvin's hot juice box."" He'll be really confused, and that's when we grab him and tie him up-style."
Chipper|  Come in, Cookie. This is Chipper. Over.
Cookie| Go ahead, Chipper. Over.
Chipper| I'm too short to lock the back door. Over.
Cookie| Hold tight, Chipper. Chipler's on his way.  You got that, Chipler?
Chipler| Affirmative. 
Jake| Did you hear that?
Finn| Yeah. Change of plans—I'll go take care of those chips. You keep the cookie distracted.
Jake| Yeah. I can do that.
Finn| Okay, awesome.
Jake| Milk? Milk?  Milk?  Some milk?
Cookie| What? Oh. Look, you should probably split, buddy. Things are about to get pretty flipped out in here.
Jake| Oh, sure. Sorry, man. I was just trying to get away from that rotten Princess Bubblegum for a while, y'know? Isn't she just the worst?
Cookie| Wait, you hate Princess Bubblegum, too? Get outta here!
Jake| Oh, yeah, man, she's the worst. Sittin' out there all safe and cozy while I'm riskin' my life tootin' around in here in this stupid milkman costume.
Cookie|  Wait—costume?!
Jake| Oh, um... I just mean it feels like a costume... 'cause I wanted to be a mailman so bad, ya see? But the princess—she made me be a milkman anyway.
Cookie| Boy, I hear ya, brother.
Chipolina|  Cookie, you there? Over.
Cookie| Yeah. Go ahead, Chipolina. Over.
Chipolina| I just saw a light go on in the stock room—probably nothing. I'll check it out. Over.
Cookie| Okay. Over.
Chipolina| Hmm.   Looks like a false alarm, Cookie. It's just some kid's Baby Snuggleghost nightlight. Hee-yah! 
Finn|  Alvin's hot juice box! Alvin's hot juice— 
Jake| So what's your story, man? How'd she doodie on you?
Cookie|  I was just a kid, man, just a little kid, when I got doodied on.
Cookie| I was the new guy at the Candy Orphanage. They called me Baby Snaps. I tried to make friends with the other kids...
Baby Snaps|  C'mon, guys, let's dance it up!
Cookie| They were always too depressed to play.
Candy Child| No, no. We're too depressed.
Cookie| Things went on like that for a while, then... one day...  she showed up.  Everything was different.
Princess Bubblegum| ...a thunderous cheer  as Baby Whoozlefut...
Cookie| Everything was-was better with her around. And something inside me changed that day, too. And then later she told me I could be anything I wanted.
Princess Bubblegum| Anything your sweet heart desires!
Cookie| And I told her I wanted to be a princess like her, so I could make all the children happy.
Baby Snaps|  I wanna be a princess like you!
Cookie| And she laughed in my face, man! It really messed me up.
Jake| Holy shmow, man. That's terrible. That's really terrible. Listen, I—
Cookie|  She LIED to me!
Jake| Yeah, but, maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to you.
Cookie|  No, she just wants to hog all the princessin' for herself!  All chips, report in. It's time to get real! Over.  Chips. Chips. Over.  Chips! Where are my chips?! Chipolina! Chipler! Chipton! Chipper! Is anyone there?! Chipface? Something happened to my chips!  AAAAH!  I'm about to flip out, man... and take that crown!
Jake| Whoa, whoa, wait! It doesn't have to be like this! You don't need that crown. You could start over, man. You can start a new kingdom—your own kingdom... where everyone can be whatever they wanna be. I can be the mailman... and you? You can be the princess. And—
Cookie| My own kingdom?
Jake| Yeah, man.
Cookie| I... I'd like that.
Jake| Okay, then. Just sit tight, Princess. I'll get us outta here.  Hey! Hey! I'm comin' out!
Princess Bubblegum| What?
Princess Bubblegum| Jake? Jake, what's going on? Where's Finn? Where are the hostages?
Jake| Don't worry, Princess. It's okay now. Princess Cookie's gonna go away. You just gotta give him a horse to escape with and he'll go.
Princess Bubblegum| Right... and then you and Finn hunt him down and put him in the dungeon.
Jake| No, wait. He said he'd go away forever. Can't we just let him go?
Princess Bubblegum| No. That cookie is a menace. Once the hostages are safe, Cookie goes in my dungeon—in my dungeon for his life.
Cookie| Oh, boy! Would ya look at that?
Cookie| Dang!
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, well... she's all yours!
Cookie| Hot diggity! 
Jake|  Ah-ah-ah! Man, that horse ain't no good; that's a trap horse.
Cookie| What are we gonna do?
Jake| It's okay, man, I'm Jake. J-J-J-Jingo Jango! 
Cookie| Whoa! Ha HA! You're magic!
Princess Bubblegum| After them!
Cookie|  We're really doing it!
Finn| Jake! What are you doing?! What happened to the plan?
Jake| New plan—I'm gonna help Princess Cookie escape.
Finn| What? But-but he's a criminal!
Jake| No, man, Princess Cookie's a good guy. He just got dealt a bad hand. He's only trying to be what following how his dreams make you want to be, man!
Finn| Whaaaat?
Jake| You're either with us or against us.
Finn| Um... 'gainst?  WAAAH! Oof.
Jake| Hold on tight, Cookie! I'm gonna jump the gorge!
Cookie| No, Jake. Stop the horse.
Jake|  I can make it!
Jake| Princess Cookie! Are you all right?
Cookie| I'm done for, Jake.
Jake| No, everything's gonna be fine. I won't let them put you in the dungeon. Just let me talk to them. 
Cookie| No, Jake.
Cookie| Thank you for your help, but it's too late for me. 
Cookie| I'll never be a princess. At least for a moment, you helped me feel like a princess. It was wonderful.  Thank you, Jake.
Jake| Careful, Princess!
Cookie| You know what? It's funny, but you sort of remind me of a mailman I used to know.
Jake|  I do?
Cookie| Yep. 
Jake|  Princess!
Cookie| I glubbed up!
Cookie| Knight to E-5.
Jake|  Where's Baby Snaps?
Jake|  Excuse, me! Your highness!
Cookie|  Jake!
Jake| Oh, hey. Check it out!  Special delivery from the Grass Kingdom!
Various Patients| He's a princess? I had no idea. Royalty!
Cuber|  Hmm? Oh! Hello there! Bayble navel! It’s great to see you! Here for more graybles, I reckon. Well, alright. Just like last time.  We’ll watch five separate stories, each relating to one special theme.  Guess the theme by the end of the episode and you’ll be the freshest mint-whistle!  Now, look to my visualizer screen and let this exciting grayble dribble all over your mind-label!  
Jake|   Okay, so- scooch! Okay so I’m still pretty sure this old book is some warlock spell book or something .
Finn|   Messed.
Jake|  Warlocks, dude!  You ready for some ancient feel good spell craft?
Finn|  Yeah, I’ll try it. Could always stand to feel better.
Jake|   Leeeeet’s seeeee. You got your bibby?
Finn|   Check it! 
Jake|   Yup! 
Jake|   I don’t feel like a good boy.
Finn|  You sure you read that spell right?
Jake|   Yeah. Still though. Pretty sweet.
Finn|  Wanna keep stickin’ our thumbs in stuff ‘til it works?
Jake|  Yeah! 
Jake|   Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! 
Finn|  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! 
Jake|  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! 
Finn|  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! 
Jake|  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! 
Finn|  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! 
Jake|  Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-am-I! 
Finn|   Ooooh! What-a-good-boy-a— Do you feel like a good boy? 
Jake|  No, I don’t.
Finn|  Hey check out that gross toad! 
Finn and Jake|   Oh-what-a-good-boy-am-I. Good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy, good boy.
Toad|   Gross! Ahahah! Cut it out! Quit stickin’ your thumbs in my back! Ahhhh! 
Marceline|  Yeeeaaah, I don’t know.  Uhhhhh, jeez! I’m never gonna find this place! Hmmm.  Hey!  Hey! Hey rock giant!  You seem cool! Do you know where wizard Bill’s music shop is? I can’t find it anywhere! He’s got a guitar that plays the most savory licks in Ooo! 
Wizard Bill|   Whaglgalgaw!
Marceline|   Huuuuh. I’ve got an idea.  Okaaay, point now.  Wahahahoh yeah! Woowhohaha!  Thanks man! 
Jake|   Let’s find some more holes.
Tree Trunks|   La da da la da da mmm deedle dee...
Finn and Jake|   What-a-good-boy-am-I!
Tree Trunks|  Oh! He he! Boys. Your manners.  Oh! Whoops! Oh!
Shelby|  Hey, Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks|  Excuse me sir. I wasn’t looking where I was-
Shelby|  Tree Trunks! Up here!
Tree Trunks|   Oh no! Heavens no!
Banana Guard|   I’m glad you brought this matter to the authorities mam. Now what exactly happened?
Tree Trunks|   Yes thank you. I-I heard a man calling out to me “Oh Tree Trunks!” So I said who’s calling? I don’t know. So I looked and he was making a RUDE gesture.  It left a sour taste in my mouth!
Banana Guard|  Alright, ma'am.  Let’s see. How do you spell your name?
Tree Trunks|  “T...”
Banana Guard|  Okay.
Tree Trunks|  “R...”
Banana Guard|  Okay.
Tree Trunks|  “E...”
Banana Guard|  Okay.
Tree Trunks|  “E...”
Banana Guard|  One sec.
Tree Trunks|  “E”! 
Banana Guard|  Hold on oone second.
Tree Trunks|  Uggh! I’m sorry, but the wheels of justice spin too slowly!  I’m going to have to take the law into my own hands!
Tree Trunks|  Thank you all for coming! The police have failed me in my time of need! So I’ve brought you here together. A posse!  I made you all blackjacks  in case things get…uuugly. I stuffed some of my stockings with balled up newspapers. I made a big one for you, because you’re so strong.  Alright then!  Let’s clean up these streets!  Oh there he is! Oh my goodness!
Gumdrop Lasses|   Weeeee! 
Tree Trunks|   Oh. Why. It’s just a statue. I-I-I don’t understand. I-It was so rude before. 
Shelby|  Hey Tree Trunks! 
Tree Trunks|  Oooh!
Shelby|  Hey! Tree Trunks! How are you!
Banana Guard|  Sheeelbyy! Have you been up there all day?
Shelby|  Yeeeeesss. Just readin’ this book. 
Banana Guard|  Uhh, well can ya read somewhere else? Ya kinda offended Tree Trunks here.
Shelby|   What? I-uh. Uh. Oh. Oooh!  I get it! 
Tree Trunks|   Wonderful! 
Ice King|   Family meeting! Family meeting gather ‘round.  Things are gonna change around here very soon! You’re gonna have a new mommy to help BOSS ya around! Well, I mean- I haven’t exactly asked her yet. Welp! No time like the present!  Ya deh deh duh duh duh deh. Sweetie, are you awake?  Great! Because I have a query I’ve been meaning to inquire of you.  Well, uh.  When two people, eh- will- Will you marry me!  Oh yah!  Yes! Yes drink up the tears! Drink up those good luck tears!  No, not you Gunter! You’re on a low-salt diet! Huh?  Uh-a-what’s that dear? Oh! I almost forgot!  Do do-do do-Do!  It’s a wife ring!  This one’s for me. I’m the husband. That means I get the remote control THREE days a week and you get it four!   Ahhh, Sweetie, this is bliss. It feels so math to finally be normal. Not like those two freaks.  What are they doin’ over there? Anyway! I-oh, who’s that?  Oh. Oh my. 
BMO|   Poor Football, you’ve come so far, but still have so much to learn.
Football|   But I don’t understand BMO. I’m a real baby girl now. I can smell the reddest lilacs. I can hear the screaming squirrels! Screaming for nuts! Oh my gosh! I can’t believe it’s true!
BMO|  No, Football. That’s not enough. You have to learn manners too. Otherwise, you’ll be all alone!
Football|  Alone? But-but what about you BMO?
BMO|  I will not always be here to protect you Football. No, you must learn. Here look!  This is a grapefruit spoon. It is only for eating grapefruit.  This is a salt shaker. Here, you try.   Now this is a turnip grincher.  For grinching. Aaand, this is how you drink tea.  Ahhh. 
Football|  Like this?  Yuck!  It’s bitter!
BMO|  No, no. Football like this. 
Football|  Like this?
BMO|  No, like this. 
Football|  Like this? 
BMO|  Like this! 
Football|  Like this, right?
BMO|  No Football. Do it like- huh?  Sorry Football. Lessons are over for tonight!
BMO|   Why so glum fellas?
Finn|   We stuck or thumbs in almost every hole today.
Jake|  But we never felt like good boys.
BMO|  I know a thing or two about good boys. Why don’t you try sticking your thumbs in these holes? 
Finn|   Controllers?  Haha! Oh yeah! Super Good Boys!
Finn and Jake|   Bawmp! 
Cuber|  So, did you guess the theme? Go ahead and pause your viewer now if you need a few more glayble to think about it a little.  Oho! Now you’ve got it! I can tell! That’s right, the theme is the five tastes.  You see, Jake ate a SWEET plum. Marceline played some SAVORY licks. Tree Trunks had a SOUR taste inside her mouth. Oh my. Gunter wanted to drink the SALTY tears. And Football's tea was BITTER.  Huh? What’s that you say? You thought the theme was the five fingers?  Don’t be silly! No one’s had five fingers for twenty blablillion glaybles. Five telepathy glands maybe.  Ah… slimmin’. Well anyway, looks like it’s that time again.  I’ll see you crimpy glimmers on triode flimpin’ the diode! 
Alarm Clock Bird|   
Snow Golem|  
Snow Golem|  
Finn|  Ice King, this the last time you steal our sandwiches!
Ice King|  You don't understand! If you were me, you would do things I would do!
Finn|  Yeah, and if you were us, you'd kick your fat butt!
Ice King|  I ... yeah, I would... but I wouldn't get past my invincible armor!
Finn|  Yaah! 
Ice King|   Not a scratch, boys! Not a scratch! It's my time to shine!
Snow Golem|  
Snow Golem|   Wuuuuh-wuuuh!
Snow Golem|  
Wolf of Fire|  
Snow Golem|  
Wolf of Fire|  
Ice King|  Fools! Fools! You're wasting your ti-yime!
Snow Golem|  
Snow Golem|   Wuh? Wuuuh-wuuuh! Wuuuh! Wuuuuh!  
Wolf of Fire|  
Snow Golem|  Ehh ...  
Snow Golem|  Wuh! Wuuuh! 
Snow Golem|  Hmmm.
Snow Golem|  Wuuuh! Wuuh!  Ah! Ahh ... Geesh ...  ...  Bo, bo, bop  with a snowball and tries to entertain the pup again.]
Snow Golem|  Huh? Wang nyangah yuh?!
Ice King|   Fools, fools, fools...
Ice King|   In-ice-able vince armor...
Ice King|  Help! Help! Somebody help me! Ah! Oh, sweet mama!
Finn|  Got you now!
Jake|  Yeah!
Ice King|  Aah! You can have the sandwiches back! I'm sorry! Help!
Snow Golem|  Bye-bye.
Ice King|  Boy, those sandwiches look really cool!  It looks like it'd be really awesome to try a bite of one of those  ... right on, right on.
Snow Golem|  You ... the ... real good. Nice... home.
Finn|  Jake, do you think that puddle needs our help?
Jake|  Nah, it's a Snow Golem, man. I think he's laughing.
Finn|  I thought Snow Golems and Fire Wolves hated each other.
Jake|  Oh, yeah, big time.
Finn|  But they learned to get along.
Jake|  Yup.
Ice King|  You know ... maybe we could all learn a thing or two from those sandwiches.
Ice King|   ... Thank you.
Squirrel|  Raaaah! Raaah! Come on! Get ready, toids! Raaah! I'm mean as a bus, and I'm mad as rocks!
Peppermint Butler| Gumball guardians! There's an enemy at the gates!
Squirrel| I'm an all-you-can-eat maniac! Whoops! Aw, come on! Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Candy Person| Whoopee!
King of Ooo|" Thank you, little candies. Thank you. You warm the wax heart of this poor king of Ooo! Now, I hear you asking, ""King of Ooo, how can you be so wise?"" I'll tell you how. Did you know that I am 8000 years old? Could be."
King of Ooo| It's true. I'm that wonderful.
King of Ooo| Now, Princess Bubblegum — she says she hasn't gone rogue. She says she's not a wild dog thirsty for blood. She says she's not a literal baby masquerading as an adult woman. She says a lot of things. Princess Bubblegum, you don't make sense!
Jake| This guy's really working on me.
Finn| Ennnh...
King of Ooo| Yes, dear? Do you have something to say?
Mrs. James| Mm-hmm. I'm James' mother, Mrs. James. My son got turned into a mutant mass and was exiled to the badlands by Princess Bubblegum.
Princess Bubblegum| Trehh! Boo.
King of Ooo| Who isn't mad about their mutant children?
Candy dude| What about Sweet P, King of Ooo? You threatened to burn down his mama's orchard.
King of Ooo|" I did. That is true. Sweet P, I was like a cornered animal. ""I knew no' what thy doone."" I'm sorry, Sweet P. Here. Psst — give me a kiss."
King of Ooo| Do you hear us, Princess Bubblegum? Do you hear us?!
Princess Bubblegum| Shhhhhhhhut up.
Peppermint Butler| Princess, I'm sorry to disturb you, but I feel that you must campaign. The candy people are real dumb.
Princess Bubblegum| I'm studying something that could be real important. Dah! This dumb election. It's not even —  I mean, it's barely even —  ...barely even legal.
King of Ooo| A barely and yet fully legal election — that's what my campaign manager told me. Let's hear it for him — Mr. X!  Weird, right?
Princess Bubblegum| And even being legal, I mean, I made everyone. I made their homes. The candy people are mercurial, but they're not dillweeds.
King of Ooo| And this definitely legal election is in the jam-covered fingers of you, the people — the candies.  So, go. Vote with your hearts. Vote with your minds. Vote for the candidate who's not a teenage gum-golem.
Princess Bubblegum| I mean, they know that I love them.
Starchy| And the votes are in. King of Ooo is our new princess.
King of Ooo| Hey, hey!
Princess Bubblegum| What?!
Princess Bubblegum| Whaaaaat?! You dillweeds! You're a dillweed, you're a dillweed's secretary, and you're probably some dillweed I've never met! You're three dillweeds being dillweeds, and you're going to dillweed this place into the ground! And you — 
Finn| Princess! Princess! I don't know what a dillweed is.
Jake| Hey, PB, what's the plan? We pledged our allegiance to you.
Princess Bubblegum| Your allegiance is to the kingdom.  Dudes, I don't know. I don't know when I'll be back in charge — if I'll be back in charge. I need you both to stick around here and make sure the candy people are safe, even if it means working for a wad. Auf wiedersehen, meine champions. Mwah. Mwah.
King of Ooo| There's a new golden and waxy mornin'. Good times a-comin'. You've got your warning. There's cheap healthcare, the workcamp's there. The general tone is laissez-faire. I'm a princess, I'm a princess. I'm a priiiinceeeess.
Princess Bubblegum| What's up, Peps?
Peppermint Butler| It's stuck.
Princess Bubblegum|  
Princess Bubblegum| Ho, no, no, no, no! It's okay, everyone. It's okay. Close your eyes and repeat your safety mantra — hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie hoodie hoodup, hoodie —
Peppermint Butler| Princess?
Princess Bubblegum| Huh? Oh. Sorry, peps. I'm just so used to having my citizens around to protect. This is gonna take some getting used to.
Peppermint Butler| Permission to speak freely, ma'am?
Princess Bubblegum| Granted.
Peppermint Butler| This horrible dump does not meet the level of fancy to which I have become accustomed.
Princess Bubblegum| Noted. Also, FYI — my Uncle Gumbald built this cabin with his bare hands. I spent my summers here when I was younger. Anyway, it'll probably take a really long time for the candy people to realize a bad ruler is worse than a good ruler. Plenty of time to spruce this place up.
Starchy| Whew! Starchy thought life would be better under the King of Ooo, but now there's even more stuff to sweep.  Poor old Starchy. Always getting the sweaty end of the lollipop.
Finn| Hey, Starchy. What are you doing — sweeping?
Starchy| Oh, uh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. Suh-wee-ee-eepin'. Yeah.
Jake| Mm. Hey, is it me, or is getting purpler out here?
Finn| Oh, yeah. I think that's the catalyst comet. Guess it's getting pretty close or whatever.
Jake| Getting close? Should we evacuate or...
Finn| What? No, no. It's cool, I think. It's just here to, like, shake things up, you know?It's okay. We've got sort of a — a relationship.
Starchy| C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-comet?! Oh, Starchy don't feel good about this.
Jake| Starch?
Finn| Eht.
Mrs. gumdrop| What?! Oh, good Glob!
Jake| Shouldn't we try and calm them down?
Finn| Ehh, not after that whole knock-my-tower-over-onto-the-castle thing. A lot of guys got smooshed. They need to hear it from someone they really trust.
Finn| King of Ooo!
Jake| King of Ooo!
Finn| King of Ooo?
Jake| King of Ooo?
Finn| King of Ooo?
Jake|" Wait, are you saying ""King of Ooo""?"
Finn| What are you saying?
Jake|" I thought it was ""kinkoff goo."""
Jake| Hey. You hear that?
Finn| Downstairs. King of Ooo? King of Ooo?
Jake| King of Ooo!
Jake| What the —
Finn| It's that guy from before. He's mucking around with PB's ship — added all kinds of engines to it.
Jake| Hey!
Finn| Hey, what do you think you're doing? PB don't let nobody touch her stuff — not even me, and I'm cool — least of all you, you sauce-tasting Brian-sniffer — whoa!
Finn| Whoa, whoa, whoa! Yeeh! Yeeh! Whoa! Uhhh!  No mercy, Jake.
Jake|   Aaaaah!
Finn| Hey, I'm back —  What the bing bong ping pong?! Gunther?!
Finn| What the king Kong sing song?! Whoaaaa — oof!
Gunter| Sayonara, suckers! 
King of Ooo| Uhh...
Candy person| Ugh!
Starchy| Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Comet! Oww!
King of Ooo| Aaaaah!
King of Ooo| Toronto, I've been princess for four hours, and society has already totally collapsed. Plus, now the sky is falling, I guess. Is this possibly... Somehow my fault?
Toronto| Pbbt! No way! Okay, look. Without your calming presence and selfless leadership, this situation would have been a hundred times worse. History will remember you as Ooo's greatest hero.
King of Ooo| As always, the voice of reason. Once again, my saintly nature has compelled me, unthinking, to assume the burdens of others. But a true justice demands a true accounting. And truly this is all Bubblegum's fa-aa-aa-ault!
King of Ooo| Oof! Good glob! What no-o-o-o-o-w?
Princess Bubblegum| Looking good, Peps. Man, this feels kind of good, right? It's like we're building a whole new kingdom from scratch, only without all my beloved citizens this time... and their dull, pleading chicken eyes. Maybe the King of Ooo could hold down the fort for a little while. I mean, what's the worst that could happen? Anyway, I'm gonna get some fresh air. B.R.B. What the — why's it so purple outsi—
Finn|  Whoa whoa whoa.
Jake| BMO, what's wrong? 
Jake| I think he broke his egg.
Finn| Hey, it's okay BMO. Look, Jake and I will make you a funny face. 
Jake| Hey, BMO, this will cheer ya up! 
Finn|  What the?! 
Jake| Well, I'm outta ideas.  What?
James Baxter|  James Baxter! James... Baxter!
Jake| Oh, man, James Baxter is so good, man. He always knows just what to say to cheer a guy up!
Finn| Yeah, man.
Jake| So good!
Finn| Man, we should do it to! Do his thing and spread the good will!
Jake| Yeah, man, I wanna be like James Baxter, always rollin' in on a beach ball, saying his name in a horse voice, making people smile.  Let's do it!
Finn|  Yeah!
Finn|  Finn the Human!
Jake|  Jake!
Finn|  Finn!
Jake|  Jake!
Jake|  Sheesh, tough crowd.
Finn|  I think we should find an easier person to cheer up. It was a mistake to visit a funeral.
Green Lollipop Girl| Eh, what do you want?! Please, I'm just a very sad girl!
Finn| That is so perfect!
Jake| Yeah, man, so unique!
James Baxter| James Baxter! James Baxter!
Finn| Man, what's he doing that we're not? We just gotta figure that out.
Jake| No, it's like, he's shredding on a guitar and learning how to shred isn't just copying the exact notes as someone else's solo. You need to learn how to do your own solo. 
BMO| Why am I recording?
Finn| You're documenting our creative flow in case we make a breakthrough.
Jake| Dude, I think we do got something.
Finn| Let's check the video.
BMO|  Bathtub, Bathtub!
Jake| Alright, BMO, play the video.
BMO|  Who's gonna scrub me?
Jake| I'll scrub,  you take notes.
Finn| Yeah, right there, speed it up.
Finn| Slow it down.
BMO| Yeah, that sounds makes me feel happy!
Finn| Good, good, happy is what we want.
Jake| BMO, zoom in on my mouth 
Finn|" Yeah, it's good,  but if we want to be ""James Baxter"" good, we gotta to go deeper."
Jake| The Institute of So Und.
Finn|  Hey, hey man!
Receptor|  I receive you. Welcome to the Sound Institute of So Und.
Finn| Where is the studio to make the best feel-good sound?
Receptor| Just think happy thoughts and follow the beat of your heart.
Finn| Hold up.... This way... 
Jake|  Look at this tricked out studio! Half stacks! Full stacks! Oooh, distortion pedals!
Jake| These sounds make feel-good, right here. 
Finn| Right here.  Good!
BMO| I feel it here,  good here!
Finn| We know to figure out how to make our sound...  force happiness into the listener!
Finn| Check our data?
Finn| Maybe it should be higher?
Jake| Yeah, maybe, maybe it could be lower, I don't know.
Finn|  Let's both agree that that sound belongs there. 
Jake| See that sound? I drew that sound connected to two other sounds. 
Finn| Hmm, something's missing. 
Jake| That's it, the missing thing in our thing!
Finn| Yeah, James Baxter don't just got his catch phrase, he has his beach ball bizz!
Jake| So we gotta create feel good body actions to go with our feel good sound!
Finn| We just crushed it, homie.
Jake|  Dude, seriously, I think our thing is gonna change the world. When people experience it, it's going to make them so happy!
Finn|  You're building it up too much.  Let's just do it.
Jake|  Yeah, man, yeah.
Jake|  Hey, there's the sad girl.  
Green Lollipop Girl| Wha—.
Jake| No no no, wait a sec! Reserve judgement until you've see the freshed-up version of our thing.
Finn & Jake| We did it! 
Jake| What's wrong?
Grass Person| We're bummed.
Speaker|  The common rhinoceros beetle, scientific name, Xylotrupes ulysses. Common dung beetle— Oh my!
Finn|  Oh good, you're still here! Hey, I know we were here yesterday  and we came off as inappropriate... 
Jake| Let's just do the thing.
Finn| Right, okay!  its portrait. The attendees see this and quickly run away screaming as the skeletal remains roll on the ground.]
Finn| Dude!!  
Ghost| WHY HAVE YOU UPSET MY DEAL?!
Finn| Jake, come on man, I need some help!
Jake|  Sorry, I act like a little kitty cat!
Finn| Whoa,  it's milk!
Ghost|   WHY?!! 
Jake|  Dang, this is real! 
Jake|  Eeeee, he broke my squishy bones!
Finn|  Don't worry, Jake, I'll block this one!
Jake|  Finn, when we wake up in the 9th Dead World, promise me you'll listen for this sound 
Finn| What?
Jake| It's just that there are a lot of dead people there, we might get separated. I'll be the one going 
James Baxter|  James Baxter!... James Baxter! 
Ghost| Holy cow!  Hey, man, this guy really knows how to cheer a guy up!  He's awesome, do you know this guy! 
Finn| Well, sort of.
Jake| Yeah, we know him!!
Ghost|  What's his deal?
Jake| His name's James Baxter, he just travels around on his beach ball making people happy.
James Baxter|  James Baxter!
Ghost| Cool.
Finn|  Candy Party! Jake! This party is so crazy!
Jake|  I know, Finn! I know! 
Gumdrop Lass 1|  So, Finn... Do you have a girlfriend?
Gumdrop Lass 2|  Oh, my gosh! I can't believe you just said that.
Punch Bowl|   What a wonderful, marvelous party!
Cinnamon Bun|  Okay. I'm gonna do it. Okay-okay-okay. Everyone watch! I'm gonna do a flip!
Cinnamon| Bun  Oh no!
Finn|  Princess Bubblegum's in trouble!
Candy Person|  Watch where you're going!
Princess Bubblegum|  Ahhhhhhhhhh!
Princess Bubblegum|  Please! Calm yourselves, my people. I am safe! Oh, thank you, Finn. You truly are my hero this day.
Finn|  Cool.
Princess| Bubblegum   Hero... Hmmm... Heeeeerroooo... Hey, I just thought of something!
Finn|  Uhh... What'd you think of?
Princess| Bubblegum  I'll show you. Come on! We'll go through my secret entrance.  Alright, everyone. Turn around.
Princess Bubblegum|   Well, turn around. This entrance is secret.
Candy People|  Oh.
Princess| Bubblegum   Math. Hurry, Finn!
Finn|   No way!
Princess Bubblegum|   Here it is. Check it out.
Finn|  A magical globe?
Princess| Bubblegum  No, Finn. It's what you can see through the globe.
Finn|  Golly!
Princess Bubblegum|   Look. See this book?
Finn|  Yeah, I see it!
Princess Bubblegum|  It's called the Enchiridion. It's a book meant only for heroes whose hearts are righteous.
Finn|  Shmow-zow!
Princess Bubblegum|  The book lies at the top of Mount Cragdor, guarded by a manly minotaur. It's waiting for a truly righteous hero to claim it!
Finn|  Do you think I've got the goods, Bubblegum? 'Cause I am in to this stuff!
Princess| Bubblegum  Yeah, I know. And yes, I do.
Finn|  Then off I go!
Finn|  Jaaaaaaaaake!
Finn|  Thanks, pal.
Princess Bubblegum|   Farewell, Fi—Oh, wait a minute...  Farewell, Finn the human boy!
Finn|  Bye, Princess!  You know what time it is, buddy?
Jake|  Aaaaadventure time?
Finn|  Yeah, man!
Key-per|  Greetings, young heroes to be. This mountain is called Cragdor. Its purpose is two-fold To protect the Enchiridion and to test the hearts of those who seek to possess it. Many noble challengers have entered the temple to pass the grueling trials that lie behind these walls, but no one has ever left here alive or dead! Only the truest most worthy hero can receive the heroes' Enchiridion and walk out these doors again! If it is you, friend,  and I cannot say that I am certain, but you are verily welcome to try; However, first you must pass my riddle. My name is Key-per, and duly so, for I carry the key to this door, but all is not how it appears, you see. Or perhaps you do not see at all.  Perhaps the key is in you, child, but you cannot use your brawn here. The door is magically sealed.
Key-per|  Oh ho! You've unlocked the riddle of the door.  Brilliantly done, child! Please, reveal to me how you unraveled my clue.
Finn|  I just thought you'd look cute stuffed in that lock.
Key-per|  Oh, yes. That's how most people get in.
Finn|  Bye!
Key-per|  You've passed the first trial, young heroes, but prepare yourselves!  For there are many trials ahead of you, and each trial is more treacherous than the last.
Jake|   Enchiridion is...  That way.
Finn|  What?! Dude! You can't smell the book from here!
Jake|  It's in the castle on top of the mountain.  In a room.  Wish you had one, huh?
Finn|   This way!
Jake|  What about the book?
Finn|  It can wait. Someone needs our help.
Jake|  Yo, Finn. Are you alright? Did you get brain damage?
Finn|  I'm fine! Keep going! We have to hurry!
Finn|  I gotcha.
Red Gnome|  Thank you for saving us.  Now we can destroy this old lady!
Old Lady|  La la la-la!
Finn|  What?!
Red Gnome|"  Every time you say ""what"" we'll destroy an old lady."
Finn|   What?!
Red Gnome|"  Every time you say ""no"" we'll destroy an old lady."
Finn|   No! Wai...
Finn|  Please...
Finn|  Don't destroy...
Finn|  Anymore...
Finn|  Old women.
Red Gnome|  Every time you look sad we'll destroy a big old woman!
Big Old Woman|  Well... Ever since I got the...  Ahhhh!
Red Gnome|   Hey, guys. Every time he's a big wuss, let's destroy an old lady.
Other Gnomes|   Yeah!
Jake|  Hey! Back off, you gnomes! That kid just saved you guys! You should thank him, not destroy old ladies! Do you even know what I'm talking about? Say thank you! Say... Thank... You.
Red Gnome|  Kill him!
Jake|   Get back in there!
Jake|  Hey, Finn. You okay?
Finn|  No way, dude. Those old ladies are destroyed because of me. I'm not righteous. I'm wrongteous. Stupidteous.
Jake|  Awww. Don't let those gnomes and their illusions get you down. They're just gnomes and illusions.
Finn|  Illusions?
Jake|  Yeah, man. Think. What would regular, old, sweet ladies be doing wandering the hills of Mount Cragdor?
Finn|  Maybe they're lost?
Jake|   No way. This place is designed to mess you up. To mess with your head. None of this is real. It's all just trials to test your heroic attributes.
Finn|  Hmmm... Hmmm!
Jake|  Now let's go get that book.
Finn|  Yeah! You're the smartest dog I know, man.
Finn|  Jake? Jaaaaaaaake!
Ogre|  You cannot pass!
Finn|  Gimme back my friend!
Ogre|  No!
Jake|   It's ok, Finn! I can get out!
Finn|  Let Jake go, or I'll...  I'll kick your foot!
Ogre|   It is impossible for you to hurt me!
Jake|   Don't worry, dude! I found another way—oof!
Finn|  Huh?  I'm coming, buddy!
Ogre|   I think your dog finally fell into my stomach. Hey... Where'd you go?
Finn|   I got your wallet, man!
Ogre|  No! My big money! Give it back!
Finn|  Give me back my friend!
Ogre|  But I killed him already!
Finn|   Fine.  I'll give you your dollar.  Here's your dollaaaaaarrrrr!
Ogre|  Oof!
Jake|  Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa-oa!
Finn|   Jake!  You're okay!
Jake|   Stomachs are weird.
Jake|  Dude! You just flew us all the way to the top! Wait a minute.  I can smell the book right through this door.
Ogre|   You're under arrest for stealing my dollar! 
Finn|  Just a minute, Jake.
Ogre|  Hey!
Jake|  You know what that was? That was righteous.
Finn|  Thanks, Jake. Now sniff out that book for me.
Jake|  You got it!
Finn|  Whoa!
Dark Magician|  Congratulations, Finn the human. You must be truly righteous to have made it this far.
Finn|  Thank you.
Dark Magician|  Now! Enter my brain-world, and I will show you some aspect of yourself that you're not entirely aware of.
Finn|  Where... am I?
Dark Magician|   For your final trial, slay the beast!
Finn|  Why? Is it an evil beast?
Dark Magician|  Yeeeeessss. It's completely evil. Will you slay it?
Finn|  Shoot, yeah. I'll slay anything that's evil. That's my deal.
Dark Magician|  Yeeeeessss! You've done well, hero.
Finn|  Thank you.
Dark Magician|  Now! As one last, last trial... Slay this ant!
Finn|  Is it evil?
Dark Magician|  No! But it's not good either. It's, uh, neutral. Will you slay it?
Finn|   No!
Dark Magician|  If you want the heroes' Enchiridion, then slay this unaligned ant!
Finn|  Never. Never. Never!
Dark Magician|   Uh oh.
Key-per|   Congratulations, Finn the human. Now you have truly reached...
Finn|  Never!
Key-per|  Ooh!
Finn|  Oh, no! Mr. Key-per! I-I'm sorry. Why are you wearing that little devil costume?
Key-per|  These are my pajamas. I was getting ready for bed.
Mannish Man|   Finn... Jake... You made it!
Finn|  Are you another trial?
Mannish Man|  Trial? Oh, no!  I'm Mannish Man, the minotaur.
Finn|   The manly minotaur from Princess Bubblegum's story!
Finn|  So, can I check out the Enchiridion? Can I? Can I? Can I?
Mannish Man|  Yeah. Come on. Let's go check it out.  Woohoo!
Mannish Man|  We've been watching you guys on our magical viewing globe. Take a seat guys, have some juice. There's grape and apple and the gatekeeper made spaghetti. And... Alright, Finn. Are you ready for this?
Finn|  The Enchiridion!
Mannish Man|   You deserve it, Finn.
Finn|  Really?
Mannish| Man  Yeah, Finn. You're the goodest of heart and most righteous hero I've seen here. Tenderness, ingenuity, bravery, nard-kicking ability, and when you took that giant ogre's dollar...  Oh, man! The Key-per nearly fainted!
Key-per|  It's true!
Jake|   Hey! Crack open that book and read something for fun's sake, alright?
Finn|  Oh, yeah.  Whoa. How to Kiss Princesses? 
Jake|  Whoa. What'd you just read?
Princess| Bubblegum   Yeah. What does it say, Finn? Mannish Man won't tell me.
Mannish Man|   Hey. Don't tell her, Finn.
Finn|  It doesn't say anything, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum|   Mannish Man!
Finn|   Awwww... Yeah!
Ice King|  Good morning, Breakfast Princesses. 
Breakfast Princess|  Huh?  Sis, give me the phone.   Oh, hey, Finn. I got another Ice King situation here. Oh, yeah? That would be great! Thanks.
Finn|  Ice King?! How many times have we warned you about using love potion?
Ice King|  That's why I'm using honey.
Jake|  Man, who cares if it's honey? You stink anyways.
Finn|   Yeah, you stink so much I'm gonna ground you for a week!
Ice King|  What? You can't do that!
Finn|  You're grounded for two weeks!
Ice King|  You're grounded for two weeks!
Finn|   Three weeks.
Jake|  Oh, snaps!
Ice King|  Why? I didn't do anything.
Finn|  Four weeks?
Ice King|   Fine. But I'm only gonna do it for a week.
Finn|  That just grounded you for four weeks.
Jake|  Oh, dang!
Ice King|   Okay.  What's up with the peace sign?
Jake|  Oh, nah, I'm just trying to show you how many weeks ya got.
Finn|  Get outta here, bubble-butt!
Jake|  Awesome. 
Ice King|  This is so unfair! They're the ones who should be grounded. Not me!  I'm so mad! I could just hit them! If only I could hit them without leaving the castle.   H...I...T...M...A...N.  Ooh! [A profile pops up. It is the Scorcher's profile. It reads
Ice King|  Perfect. 
Ice King|  Whoa, you are fast.  And quiet.  And very good at dramatic silence. I like it.  Alright, so, how do we do this? We shake hands or...  Oh-ho, paperwork!   Finn and Jake.  Whoosh!  A-ha, there he is. Huh? What's he doing?  What the—?! I hired a hitman, not a fireman! 
Jake|  Dude, you see my masterpiece coming together, right? 
Finn|  Mine's whack. 
Jake|  Well, put some meat in there!
Finn|  Huh. What kind of meat is that?
Jake|  That's Meat Man's meat.
Finn|  Do you think it hurts Meat Man when he gives us his meat?
Jake|  I don't know. I can't read his mind.
Jake|   No!
Ice King|  You guys, I—
Finn|"  What do you think ""grounded"" means?!"
Jake|  It's wasted, man.
Finn|  Oh, great. Now see what you did to my buddy? So help me, Ice King.
Ice King|  Okay, okay. Goll. 
Finn|  It's alright, buddy. We can make another. 
Ice King|  Sheesh, this Scorcher guy's got some weird ideas about hitting.
Ice King|  Hey, there you are! What's that? I already signed that.  I thought I told you to hit them, not burn them alive! You big dummy! Goll! It's almost like you want to kill them! Lucky for them, I stopped the fire!  You know what happens when you're burned alive?! Your eyeballs explode! Bleh!  Hey wha—?
Finn|   Punch, punch, punch!
Jake|   Rainicorn, don't eat 'im. 
Ice King|  Ice wind! Blow! Blow! Blow!
Jake|   Meat Man. Meat Man, I'm sorry, Meat Man, I didn't mean it, man. 
Ice King|  Finn and Jake, I am just a dream. I was never here...
Ice King|  Okay, mister, you are really trying my patience. How clear can I be?! All I want you to do is hit them. On the shoulder or something.  Are you even listening? Oh, I get it.  Here's double the grease to not kill Finn and Jake.  You trying to hustle me, Scorcher? Okay, I'll play this game. How about this prized piece for your pad?   No! Okay, how about these bad boys? Night-vision x-ray goggles. For when you have a lady house-guest.  Oh, come on!  At least renegotiate the target! You can destroy my least favorite princesses.  What about Lumpy Space Princess?  Ghost Princess?  I can't even hold her with my love mitts.  Aw, geez! Uh...  Oh! A—A leg cramp! In my leg! Ow, ow, ow.  Oh, this is so embarrassing. I'll be right back!   Ow, ow, ow!  Huh. Think, baby, come on. Ah!  Alright, let's hit the hitman, right? There's gotta be a—  Ah! [A profile for 'Blastronaut' comes up. It reads
Ice King|  Blastronaut. #1 solution for all Hitman problems. Sheesh, 99.95? That's nuts.   Scorcher. 
Ice King|  Sweet!
Ice King|  No! Come back, you wussy!  Ooh, that was weird.  Was that your friend, or something?  Look, a super model! Look, a hover-board! Look, the apocalypse! Someone got hit in the boing-loins! Hit in the boing-loins!  Boing-loins! Boing-loins. Somebody got hit in them.  Peace out! 
Ice King|  Freakin' butt! Butt, butt, butt!
Jake|  Hey, Finn, you awake yet?
Finn|   I'm trying.
Jake|  I had a dream about Meat Man.
Finn|  Oh, yeah?
Jake|  I think I'm gonna stop eating Meat Man. 
Finn|  You're grounded!
Ice King|  I know, but shush!
Ice King|  Okay, I hired a guy to kill you by accident.
Finn and Jake|  What?!
Ice King|  I thought he was going to just hit you in the gut and make you spit up your lunch.  Well, I froze him in ice, but I think he's free now 'cause he's made out of fire. Or he commands fire, maybe?
Jake|  Good job. Good job, the Ice King.
Finn|  Oh, my life!
Jake|  C'mon, man, let's get outta here!
Finn|  Jake, do something. He's getting close!
Ice King|  You alive?
Jake|  Uh, I think so.
Ice King|  Whew! That was close.
Jake|  Uh, hey, guys? I don't think this ice dome is gonna last long.
Finn|  What do we do?
Ice King|   Ooh, got it! I'm gonna kill you guys!
Jake|  Hey, I'll kill you!
Ice King|  No, wait a minute, you two. I won't actually kill you. I'm just gonna lower your body temperatures so you seem dead. And after we fool that fool outside, I'll warm you up, good as new.
Jake|  No way, man!  You already messed up enough stuff. You're probably gonna kill us, too.
Finn|  Yeah, we don't trust you!
Ice King|  You'll thank me later.
Ice King|   Stop! Time out! You don't need to do this anymore! Look! They're dead! I killed them myself!  Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead! They're dead. No pulses.
Ice King|  So, uh, looks like, you can go home now.
Ice King|  Oh, yes, of course.  There. [The Scorcher burns the contract and disappears in a black vapor. He leaves a paper that reads
Ice King|  Oh, glad all that's over.  Hey, guys, guess what? You're grounded. Underneath my butt! 
Finn|  Oh, no, our sled's broken! Hey, let's build one out of snow! 
Finn|  What are you doing, Jake?
Jake|  Sleds are for suckers. Just ride on my gut.
Finn|  Okay! 
Jake|  Switch!
Finn|   Switch back! Switch back! 
Finn|  Penguins!
Finn|  Ha Ha!
Jake|  I'm a flying dog! 
Ice King|  What?!  Who dares enter the Ice Kingdom?!
Finn|  Aww, Ice King's here.
Ice King|"  You know why I'm here? Do you know what ""Ice King"" means?!"
Jake|"  Yeah, I know what ""Ice King"" means A big nerd!"
Finn|  Oh ho oh! Holy cow!
Ice King|  It means I'm King of Ice! This is my domain! And you are violating Ice World law--trespassing!
Jake|  Come on, brother! We're just trying to beat the heat.
Finn|  Yeah! There's a big sleeping lava man in our front yard, and he is SOOOOOOOOOOOO hot!
Jake|  Mmm-hmm!
Finn|"  Wait, wait, no, I take it back. I mean, not like ""sexy"" hot."
Jake|"  No, no, you do mean ""sexy"" hot."
Finn|  No, I mean--
Ice King|   I don't care! This is my kingdom. You guys can't just scoot about on my land willy-nilly. I've got rules here.
Finn|   Why don't you just try being cool.
Ice King|   What?! I am the king! I am the king of c-cool c-co ca... That's it! Rise, monsters of snow, and go beat up Finn and Jake! 
Jake|  Uh oh.
Finn|  
Ice King|   Ooh, you guys are gonna get it.
Finn|  Heh heh, yeah.
Jake|  Yeah, right, sure.
Ice King|   I need a magic back.  Trail mix.  Ick...ooh, yogurt chip.  Tuck, tuck.  Aww man.
Ice King|  I'm back home! Hello, ladies!
Ice King|  Now, now. I've brought you a baby and a puppy. 
Wildberry Princess|  Finn! Are you okay?
Finn|  Huh, Wildberry Princess? Hot Dog Princess? W-what's goin' on?
Slime Princess|  We're all prisoners, Finn.
Finn|  Ice King!
Ice King|  What?
Finn|  Why are you keeping these girls prisoners, jerk?
Ice King|  You don't understand! I collect princesses because I want to marry one.
Jake|  Well, why'd you capture six of them if you just want to marry one?
Ice King|  I'm collecting them all first to be sure I make the right choice. You're both too young to understand, but marriage is a serious thing and lasts forever. You can't just rush into it, you know?
Finn|  Ice King, don't do this. Just let the girls go. They don't want to be here.
Ice King|  Of course they do! I would have killed them already if they didn't want to be here. Right ladies?  Zzhp Zzhp.
Princesses|  Mm-hm.
Finn|   Don't worry, princesses. I pledge that Jake and I will protect each and everyone of you and furthermore I see all of you happily married to whatever sweet thing y'all want to be married to!
Slime Princess|  Yay!
Ice King|  
Finn| Rad! All I need is something to spear the Ice King with.  Binoculars... toothbrush...water bottle...rope...  sweater... trail mix... my flute! 
Finn|  My flute!
Jake|  Aw, nuts, dude! You broke it when we tried picking the lock to that sad ogre's heart!
Finn|  Darn it!
Ice King| Nice try, boy! Princesses, did you see? Did you see Finn fail?
Jake|  Don't worry, Finn. I'll get us out of here with Key Hand! Hah-hah! 
Ice King|  Oh, no you won't! 
Finn|  Jake!
Ice King|  Eat it.
Jake|   I... I'm okay.
Finn|  Ice King! You better either set us free or come in here and fight me 'cause otherwise I'm gonna flip out!!!
Ice King|  Oh, are you trying to hit me? Well, excuse me because I have to go potty in the bathroom. 
Finn|  ICE KING!!!...
Jake|  Finn!
Finn|  Huh? Jake, you alright?
Jake|  I'm fine, buddy. Calm down and tend to the princesses.
Finn|  Oh my gosh. I'm sorry, princesses. Slime Princess, are you alright?
Slime Princess|  He's held us here for weeks, questioning us about our favorite sports and quirky behavior. I've tried to tell him as little as possible.
Finn|  I understand. And, Lumpy Space Princess, how do you fair?
Lumpy Space Princess|  I'm bored, and I'm not having any fun.
Ice King|"   What? Not having any fun? But last night I read you the story of ""Baby Whatsit and the Bottle Prince."""
Lumpy Space Princess|  That wasn't fun. That was lame.
Ice King|  Other princesses, do you feel the same way?
Ice King|  Well, here, watch. I'll show you. We'll have some fun. Fun's my middle name.
Ice King|  Here, now, Wildberry Princess. I need you to play this. 
Wildberry Princess|  I don't know how.
Ice King|  Well, come here, I'll teach you. Put your hand through the bars, atta princess, and uh... 
Wildberry Princess|  I don't think I can.
Ice King|  Just play it like I showed you.
Finn|  Leave her alone, Ice King!
Ice King|  PLAY IT OR I'LL SQUISH YOU INTO JUICE!!!
Wildberry Princess|  Oh dear! 
Ice King|  Yeah, keep playing it. Now everyone pick up an instrument and play it. Oh, this is going to be so much fun!
Jake|  What are you thinking, Finn?
Finn|  I've almost devised a plan. I'm gonna let him drum till' I've finalized the details in my mind.
Jake| Sweet
Ice King|  Oh, that was fun!
Finn|  Ah! It was fun! Hey, you should get some more fun stuff.
Ice King|  You're right! Good idea, Finn.
Finn|"  ""Good idea,"" indeed."
Ice King|  I hope they think I'm fun. 
Finn|"  Alright. I've got a plan on how to get out of here. First everyone needs to be dancing and laughing and saying fun stuff like ""Whoopee""! Okay, when the Ice King comes back, everyone play it up, like we want him to come inside the jail and party with us and when he steps inside, I'm gonna beat the tar out of him with these...  ...while you all take care of Jake. Everyone on board with this?"
Jake|  Sweet plan, dude!
Lumpy Space Princess|"  I think by everyone saying ""whoopee"" the plan won't work cause he'll know we're faking it."
Finn|  Good point, Lumpy Space Princess.
Lumpy Space Princess|"  I'm gonna say something fun like ""Oh yeah, I'm having a fun time! Oh my gosh, havin' the best time I've ever had in my entire life!"""
Ice King|  Make way for the fun tray! Whoa, what's happening?
Ice King|  What is this?
Finn|  We're having fun! Whoopee!
Ice King|  Because I left the room?
Jake|  Because they like it here. Because they like you. Because you're a really fun guy!
Ice King|  I don't get this.
Finn|   He's not buying it. Dance harder.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Come on in here and party.
Finn|  Wanna dance with us, Ice King? Come on!
Ice King|  Me? You want to dance with me?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh yeah! Whoo! Woohoo!
Ice King|   Wow!  Yes! Yes! Whoopee!
Ice King|  Wait, no!  Don't leave! I'll kill you all!  Why are you doing this? Everyone was finally warming up to me.
Finn|  No! That is not the case! You're nuts, man! And I don't know how to help you! Probably because I'm just a simple dude. So maybe you should talk to someone with more life experience, like Jake!
Jake|  Whoa, whoa, whoa, Finn, what are you doing? Don't dump the Ice King on me!
Finn|  But you gotta get it in you're head, man! Putting princesses in jail is wrong!
Ice King|  Bah! Finn, you just ruined my chances with 5 or 6 potential wives! For that you will...  Ohh! Oh, my beard. 
Ice King|  Why do people not like me? Is it because I'm a magic user or is my beard too shaggy?  I try so hard to be a good husband for girls. What's wrong with me?
Comic Owl|  Hoo. You're a sociopath.
Ice King|  Who are you?  I know. You're probably a--a big nerd! Why don't you try being cool like me?  Star dust is so ticklish!  What happened? Princesses? Ohhh...
Slime Princess|  Thank you, Finn.
Finn|   You're welcome, Slime Princess!
Slime Princess|  And remember when you vowed to marry us to the thing of our choosing?
Finn|  Yeah...
Slime Princess|  Well, I'd like to marry you.
Everyone else|  Ooooh!
Finn|   Oh, heh heh, well how 'bout that... Jake, help me!
Jake|  Oh, eh... Slime Princess, you shouldn't marry Finn. He pees his pants constantly. All the time.
Princesses|  Ewww!
Slime Princess|  Oh, gross! Put me down! Put me down!!!
Finn|  Heh heh, I'm sorry. Jake! 
Ice King| All right! Where is he?!
Finn| Ice King?!
Ice king| Where is he?!
Finn| Jake? He's right there.
Jake| Man, Ice King, you better roll on.
Ice King| Where are you hiding him?!
Finn| Who are you talking about?
Ice King| It's Gunter! He's gone missing!
Ice King| You in there, Goontz?
Finn| Ice King, we didn't take Gunter.
Jake| Come on, man, not the food.
Ice King| Daddy's here to save you, Goonty!
Finn| What makes you think we took him?
Ice King| 'Cause it's obvious You took Gunter, because Gunter is like your Jake.
Finn| Wait, what?
Ice King| Or maybe Gunter's like your Finn. The point is, you guys have always resented us for that fact, and that right there constitutes motive And conspiracy to harm my little road dog, Gunter!
Finn| Hey, Jake, do you think you could, like, turn into a little Gunter and go over to him?
Jake| That's gonna be kind of weird.
Finn| Yeah, but it'll calm him down, so
Jake| All right, all right, all right. Wenk, wenk.
Ice King| Aww, look at the little guy.
Finn| You want to try telling us what happened?
Ice King| Okay, so, we were watching some young men's junior figure skating championships on the tube semi-finals. I went to the kitchen to fix us up something to eat. When I came back, he was gone.
Finn| What do you think, Jake? Should we check out the ice kingdom for clues?
Jake| Or we could get a real good night's sleep and start fresh and early in the morning. Wenk, wenk.
Finn|  
Baby Finn| That's the comet you're supposed to follow.
Finn| Right. Right. I knew that. 
Baby Finn| Hey, be careful, okay? Hold on tight.
Finn| It's okay. I won't ever let you go.  That's... true.
Finn| Wow. Already? That was fast.
Baby Finn| Yep. We're here. It's time to wake up now.
Finn| What? Now?
Baby Finn| Yep.
Finn| Like, right now?
Baby Finn| Ye—
Finn|  Ah. Where am I?  What the heck? Is that the comet?  And a little farming village? How long have I been walking?
Vulture| Man, two whole days—at least!
Finn| Wow. I need some water. 
Vulture| No, wait—ah... jeez.
Finn|  Hmm... Fields are lookin' a little sparse.  Kinda runty... I wonder if this village even has any wat—oh, snap! I see some!
Finn| Excuse me, sir. Can I have some water? I've been sleepwalking for days.
Finn| Haha, awesome.  Haha! Heck yeah! Thanks, little friend! You just totally saved my life. No pun intended. What's the matter? Can't talk? Oh, or are you guys comet boys? From up in there? Listen, I'm no expert, but I think y'all are gonna need a lot more corn.  And it's suppose to stand straight up-like. Or maybe comet boys only need just, like, a little bit of limp corn?
The villager| No, I'm a regular guy. I'm not just supposed to talk to strangers.
Mom|  Lionel, what'd I tell you about talking to strangers? You get your butt inside this instant!
Tree spirit|  HUMAN BOY!
Finn| What the?
Tree spirit| THE TREE SPIRIT DOES NOT PERMIT FREELOADERS! EITHER HELP FETCH THE ESCAPE POD ENGINE OR KINDLY MOVE ALONG!
Finn| Dad?
Tree spirit| Wait, wait! What are you doing? DON'T COME OVER HERE.
Finn| Dad?
Martin|  Finn! What the heck are you doing here?
Finn|  Dad! What the heck are you doing here?
Finn| What? You were just yelling at me.
Martin| No, no, no, that was the tree spirit—commander of all trees, bringer of hard times.
Finn| Dad.
Martin| You're not falling for it, huh? Well, it was worth a try.
Martin| You know those little guys down there, they'll do anything for the tree spirit. I've got them fetching parts to fix my escape pod, instead of planting their fields. Isn't that sweet?
Finn| Dad, your arm.
Martin| Oh, this? Haha, yeah. When my ship crashed I got shot out of the window. I knocked a kite of the air, then caught my arm in a woodpecker hole.
Finn| Whoa.
Martin| But, it's cool, you know. Arms come and go. It's family that's important.  Speaking of arms, though, I see you got yourself a brand spanking new one. How about that!
Finn| Oh. Yeah. I got it from my PB dream sword.
Martin| Uh-huh. Neat.
Finn| Actually, for a while there, I thought if I ever saw you again, I was gonna tear your arm off.
Martin| Well, shoot, who could blame you? Yeah. But you definitely don't feel that way anymore, right?
Finn| No, no, it's okay now.
Martin|  Haha! Great! How about a hug?
Finn| What the heck, Dad! Is everything you say a lie?
Martin| No, no, of course not!
Finn| Well, is there any way I can tell the difference?
Martin| Ha ha, I hope not!
Martin| Hot dang! Hold that thought! Those little guys are back with the engine bulb for my pod. 'Scuse me.
Martin|  I AM SENDING FORTH MY HOLY EMISSARY, MARTIN MERTENS, AND HIS REGULAR SON, FINN. DON'T FORGET TO DO WHATEVER MARTIN TELLS YOU.
Martin| Almost there. Little further. Aha, little further. Keep it coming. There you go. A li-i-ittle further. A-a-and stop.  Fantastic work, boys, absolutely fantastic.
Finn| Holy stonk, Dad! You're messing 'em all up.  This is why you are lying to them? So they'll mess themselves up for you?
Martin| What! No, no, no, look! They love it, see?  Goochy goochy goo. Goochy goochy!  They're helping a poor old stranded man in need. You like to help people, don't ya? I'd do it myself if I could, but I'm too strong to fit through the service hatches. Come on, give me a chance.  They're gonna fetch me one last piece, and you and I can watch 'em do it. Then I'll be outta your hair by tomorrow morning.
Finn| Oh. Right.
Martin| Yeah, don't worry. I know I'm cramping your style down here. Am I right? Huh?
Finn| Uh... yeah. Yeah, I-I guess...
Martin| Sure I am! Now let's go fetch that piece.
Finn| It's really warm down here.
Martin| Well, yeah, son. That's just the ship cooking. One thing about this ship, it cooks!
Finn| Should it be cooking?
Martin| Nah, but that's just real life.  Okay, babies! I need this piece.  It's a steering wheel. It's in the steering room.  Last one in breaks tree spirit's heart!
Finn| Wait, wait, wai-wai-wait! You don't have to go in there if you don't want to!
Villager with eyepatch| Nah, I think we want to.
Martin|  Okay, I know, I know. Listen, that's the last piece of pod, right? Well, I promise I'll make it up to little boogers tonight.  Haha, come here!
Martin|  Live it up, pals! This is your night.  Hey, hey, careful with the finish. That buggy is ready to blast!  Yo, party animals! Still hungry?
One of the villagers|  Mmm.
Martin| Come on, tree spirit says!  Scoop it till you poop it. Let's get grrro-o-oss!
The villager| Finn?
Finn| Oh, sorry. So you guys wanna learn another one?  Ok, watch this. Heh, cute. Uh, hey!  So, you guys really believe in the tree spirit?
Villager| Eh, not really, I guess. We're kind of just looking to help out.
Finn| Hmm.
Martin| Hey! It's Finn with the grin! Mind if I sit down?  Haha! Look at this! You ever see someone sit like this?
Finn| I guess not. Hey, Martin?
Martin| Yeah.
Finn| Uh, I think I really need some answers to stuff—like where did I come from or who's my mom?
Martin| Haha! Whoops.  Okay, uh, long story short—you were born on a... boat... I guess. Like a... banana boat.
Martin| In the middle of the ocean. So... all kinds of stuff tried to eat you— whales and fish... squids...  uh, there was a tiger...  and... seaweeds.  The sea's weeds.
Martin| Your mom was... okay? I don't know. Talking about it stresses me out. Maybe later.
Martin| So one day, I got called on a dangerous mission—  no, like a dangerous life choice, two roads diverging in the night and all that.
Martin| And I couldn't bring you along. I always planned to come back for you, but I didn't. That's... true. The end!  Look out! 
Villager| Everything is ruined. Everyone is fat.
Finn| Aah!   Martin! 
Martin|  Again?  Oh, good morning, sweetie!
Finn| Martin, are you leaving?!
Martin| I absolutely gotta, kid. I got pressures on me, stuff you wouldn't understand.
Finn| But what about the villagers?! That ship looks like it's gonna blow up!
Martin| Uh... maybe. I don't know. Maybe it won't blow up. I've seen 100 things weirder than a ship not blowing up.
Finn| Oh, Dad! I need to go shut it off!
Martin| Okay, okay, wait! Wait.  If you're gonna turn it off, you gotta pull the heat dump toggle in the engine core. It was too snug for me to get to, and those little guys aren't strong enough. Hmm. Hey, I could wait for you. Maybe we could go into space together.
Finn| Why didn't you tell me about the heat dump in the first place?!
Martin| I don't know... Wink!
Finn| Daaaaah! 
Martin| What the—
Finn| Heat dump!  Too... stuck!
Villager|  Ohhhh, no. This is new to me. Mm... 
Finn|  
Finn| Man, you know what's weird? That wasn't even a comet that crashed back there.  So, then, what was that dream about? I don't get my brain. Okay, when we get back to the tree house, let me do the talking.
BMO|  Puppies! Puppies! Puppies!
Finn|   Hey Jake! Hey Lady! We came to see your new pups!
BMO|   Puppies!
Lady|  얘들아 안녕! 
Jake|   Hey dudes! They're still pretty sleepy. Sleepy little sweeties.  Pups, meet everybody!  Yeeees!

Lady|  천만에

Finn|  Oh dude, Mom! She'd have been so proud to see you and your pups. 
BMO|   Look! Look!
Jake|  Aw, BMO! When was the last time you washed your controller?  WHOA! 
Finn|   We were just wrestling! Cool uncle wrestling.
Jake|  Um, ah, I-I think it's gettin' kinda late. Um, puppies need sleep.
Finn|  Okay. 
Jake|   Uhhh, Finn, you should go home. I'm gonna live with Lady and the pups from now on. I'm a dad now. It's a pretty big whoop. 
Finn|  Oh. 
BMO|   Who wants to play video games?
Finn|  Yeah, okay.  I guess we'll take off.
Jake|  We'll hang out soon.
Finn|  Ah, no prob, Bob. Huh, congrats again. 
BMO|   I'll be right back!
Jake|   I'm gonna be the best dad ever! 
Jake|   Breakfast time. 
Lady|  자기 지금 뭐 하는거야... 
Jake|  Sorry honey, I'm on guard duty.  You're sleepin' for both of us tonight.   Breakfast ideas for pups. 
Holo-Margaret|   Recipe for french toast. Ingredients butter, three large eggs, a wide dash of vanilla, milk, ten slices of bread-white, brown, multi-grain, or country loaf. In a large mixing bowl crack the eggs and whisk the milk, vanilla, and all eggs and honey.  When your consistency is satisfactory, set mixture aside. Dip bread in the mixture and soak thoroughly. Heat your oven to a high heat and sauté your egg soaked bread slices till golden and toasted and serve hot with sugar, cinnamon sugar, jam, ice cream, meat, whipped cream-
Jake|   Hmm. . Kinda like a dead person.  They're just asleep. It's okay. Ya gotta be a tough dad.  AAAAHHHH!  The puppies aren't moving!
Holo-Margaret|  Perform CPR, they might be dead!
Jake|  AHHHH!  Saved 'em! Mom's manual knows best!
Jake|  You guys are getting big! Okay!  Excuse me. Mom's manual suggests that I read you guys a story.  This was your daddy's favorite book when he was cute like you! 
Jake|  This is a lot darker than I remember! Um, gimme a sec.  Is this appropriate for babies?
Holo-Margaret|   Get that book out of here!
Jake|  Yeah, okay. Sorry sweeties, Mom's manual says no. 
Lady|  자기야, 애들 데리고 나가서 바람좀 쐬고 오지 그래? 
Jake|  Take 'em out for fresh air huh?  There m- there might be a giant fox out there.  Or some-some other predator.  Hey!  This's not for babies! 
Mr. Fox|   Hey, free book.
Mr. Fox|  Hey! Hey everybody look! Look at this book I found about eating babies!  They just sit there while you eat them. 
Fox #1|  Whoa! Eatin' babies.
Fox #2|  Why haven't we been eating babies this whole time? 
Mr. Fox|  I don't know, but I'm going to go eat one right now. 
Jake|  Okay everyone, your mom wanted me to take y'all out side.  Ah ah ah, be careful.  No Charlie, no. Too much germs, you know?  Everybody just stick together and don't do anything and we can all take a nap.
Jake|  Then-  Ah! Uh! 
Jake|  AHHHH! OH MY GLOOB! No! NoOoOoO! IT'S EVERY PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE! NO! No! Noo!  Put that down! Get outta there! Ah, come back! Wait T.V., you're gonna hurt yourself! Charlie, nooooo! Viola, wait!
Lady|   얘들아! 비올라! 제이크 2세! 그만해! 찰리! 김길환! 아빠 좀 고만 괴롭히고 안에 들어와! 
Jake|   Hey Lady. These puppies are really wearing me out, you know? I can hardly keep my eyes open.
Lady|  제이크, 자기 혼자 난리치는 거야. 우리 애들 걱정 안 해도 돼. 자기가 너무 과잉보호라니까. 
Jake|  No, no it's- it's all in the manual you see- it's- it-it's got a fe- 
Lady|  아이야이야. 필요 없을 때만 난리라니까. 
Fox #3|   Is that a baby? It doesn't look right. Why's he so sweaty. And hairy.
Mr. Fox|  Look, fellas, there's never gonna be a perfect baby. Times like this ya just gotta dive right in. 
Lady|  Goochy goochy goo!  아, 얘들아, 가서 아빠 좀 도와드려라.  
Jake|  What the- What are you doing?! Let me go!  Hold on, hold on a minute. Just- just lemme- Y'all better watch out!  Puppies?! What are you doing?! Go back inside! The manual's gonna flip!
Jake Jr.| Dad! The manual's a buncha junk! Just give us a chance.
Jake|"  Jake Jr.! You said your first words! ""The manual's a buncha junk!"" ... The manual's a buncha junk? Hmm. "
Flashback Margaret|  Stay back Jakey, my manual says it's too dangerous. ]
Flashback Jake|  Mom. Your manual's a buncha junk! Look what I can do! , Jake gives the cobra an extra-large knuckle sandwich and laughs]
Flashback Margaret|  Oh... dear... glob! 
Jake|  I'm sorry for being such a little stinker kids. Come on and show the old man watcha got!
Pups|  수학!   아빠 몸체이동! 
Jake|   Whoa! What the-
Pups|  무지개 뱅!   프리즘 TBA 작동!  
Jake Jr.|   Ya see, dad? We flippin' crushed it. Crushed it!
Jake|  You did! I'm super proud y'all and I'm duper sorry too.  I've been tryin' to make you know about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox.
Lady|   애기들아! 참 잘했어! 너네 정말 대단했어! 
Jake|  Yup! I've been tryin' to make them about safety without actually learning about safety the way I did, by not listening to MY mom when that snake jumped out of the policeman's boombox.
Jake|  Hey guys. I'm back. 
Finn|   Is everything okay?
BMO|  Did you ruin it?
Jake|  Nah, nah, it's cool. It turns out the pups can pretty much take care of themselves. They don't really need me around.
Finn|  Oh.
Jake|  Yeah. I guess rainicorns age really fast. They're basically like older than me already. Kil Whan has a beard now!
Finn|  Oh!
Jake|  Ah, it's okay! I got a slammin' family right here too!  Plus all my stuff is here.
Finn & BMO| Birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday , birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday,  birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday, birthday! Yeah! Yay!
Finn| Nice job, Mr. Birthday Boy.
Jake|  Thanks.
Finn| Man, you are like another year older, but you look good. Like, super good.
Jake| Yup. Mom and dad passed down some pretty good genes.
Finn| Oh yeah, mom and dad. Hey, did mom and dad tell you any stories about when you were born?
BMO| Yay! Birthday story time, please.
Jake|  Well,  it was a day like any other day...
Margaret| There, there, baby. You're going to be a fighter.  Just like your mother.  Yes!  Barrel roll.  Ugh! 
Joshua|  Steak break.
Margaret| Let's get started. 
Joshua| These steaks are tough and stringy. Like you.
Margaret| Oh, good one, dear.  Hey, after dinner, what do you say we check the ticker-type for new cases?
Joshua| Margaret, you're in a family way now. You should take a backseat from investigations.
Margaret| Oh, come on, Joshua. Even with this ankle-biter, I'm as quick as ever. Sure, my waist is bigger, but that just means more bullets in my ammo belt.
Joshua| You're missing the point, sugar. What if something bad happens? Let's say we're out on the beat, fighting some lowlife. He takes a punch, you zig when you should've zagged, and oops! Junior takes a knock to the noodle, comes out with the shiner the size of a grapefruit. I can't take that kind of guilt and neither can you.
Margaret| I can take care of myself just fine. And besides, these babies  don't come cheap. We need to work together as a team to bring in the bread. 
Joshua|  Yeah, you got me there.
Margaret| Now let's get over to that ticker-type and look for some perps.
Joshua|" You relax, dear, I got it.  Hmm. Let's get a look here. ""Vampire girl spotted in the Grass Lands harassing sheep and cattle."" Nope, nope, nope. ""Small fire goblin burns down Candy Kingdom forest."""
Margaret| Hey, that sounds fun. Let's do that.
Joshua|" Wait, wait, here's one. "" Woman's pies go missing in Bucolic Countryside where nothing ever happens."" The perfect case for my pregnant wife!"
Margaret| What?
Joshua| Now let's get an egg in our shoe and beat it. 
Tree Trunks|  Yes? Hello?
Joshua|  Afternoon, Mrs. Tree Trunks. We're Joshua and Margaret of Joshua and Margaret Investigations. And this is  our boy. We're responding to a wire about missing pies.
Tree Trunks| Oh, yes. A-a-a monster's been stealing my pies off of the windowsill.
Joshua| A monster, eh?
Tree Trunks| Oh, yes, you can see the monster  tracks leading off into the forest.
Joshua| Well, those tracks are as phony as a three dollar bill.
Tree Trunks| The monster tracks are very real.  My husband told me so.  Wyatt!
Wyatt| Aw, aw geez. You got me.
Joshua|  What's the big idea, Wyatt? Why'd you burgle your wife's pie?
Wyatt| Because it's amazing! Oh, I can't get enough of it.
Tree Trunks| You could just ask for seconds.
Wyatt| But I want thirds and fourths! I want to stop when I want to stop!
Tree Trunks| Oh, Wyatt.
Wyatt|  Oh, it's the only good part of my day.
Joshua| Well, there you have it. The only monster here was this man's appetite for his wife's pie.
Tree Trunks| Oh, no. But the monster is real. He snuck up and rubbed my elbow while I was gardening. And Leftenant Candy Corn said it came in through the window and touched him on the chest. Oh! Oh, now I got myself all scared. W-won't you check around to make sure no one is out there?
Joshua| Of course. Probably nothing more than a peeper.  Ha! These country yokels are all just superstitious. I bet you that old elephant sees a monster a day.
Margaret| Joshua, look!  Something way larger than Wyatt made them. These tracks look real.
Joshua| Hot cram! A peeping monster! Oh, this town would surely put up a collection to nab this guy. Oh, too bad you're preggo. We got to pass. 
Margaret| Come on, Joshua! 
Joshua| What? 
Margaret| Ha ha!
Joshua| Margaret! Margaret! Wait for Pappy! 
Margaret| Hmm. The tracks end here.
Joshua|  Hey, hey! Beat it, uggos!  The peeper! 
Margaret| I'll show that peepsie the pepper!  Joshua, dear, I'm stuck!  Joshua! The beast outflanked us! 
Joshua| Gads!  Boom!  Do your worst, you masher.
Margaret| Joshua!  Drop that daddy!  Baby cakes! Oh, this is all my fault!
Joshua| Uh, yeah, pretty much.
Joshua| Ah, good last meal. Okay, well, I got bit by a monster, a creature of the night. We both know what comes next for me.  Just make it snappy, darling.
Margaret|  Don't.  Don't be melodramatic, Joshua.  I've been doing some research. Listen here. I think if we can get a sample of that creature's venom, we can use it to synthesize an antidote.  Joshua?!  Oh! Puddin' Pie!
Joshua|  I'm fine. Just got to pop out and fetch that venom.
Margaret| You're about as fine as a canary in a cat mine!  Oof! Hey, where's the fire, kiddo? You stay put.  So's I can keep tabs on you.  Feel better. Over. 
Joshua|  Come in, Margaret. Do you read me? Over.
Margaret|  I got the peep peep's trail. In pursuit. 
Joshua|" You have to say ""over"" or I think you're still talking. Over."
Margaret|  Joshua, I've stumbled upon the beast's lair.  Just hang on, Honey Bunny. Over.  Stay right there.  What?!  Ooh! Not yet!  Come on, come on!  What? What's your angle, slick? You poison my hubby, then play the innocent?  And what's with all this baby paraphernalia? Wait a tick. Are you a baby?
Monster|  Uh-huh.
Margaret| Oh, no! I must've scared the dickens out of you!  There, there, baby. I'm so sorry... For this!  I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. ] Joshua, I got the venom!  Ohhh! Uh oh, this baby business is getting SERIOUS!  Joshua!  Ohhh! Ohhh! 
Joshua| Margaret, stay away.  Something's about to happen!
Margaret|  Something's about to happen with me too! 
Joshua| Margaret! .] Shine the light, dear.  Yowzers! 
Puppy Jake|  Hello, daddy.  Hello, mommy.  It's so nice to be here with you now. , Margaret drops the flashlight and the second puppy moves a lot - and that is how Jake's little brother Jermaine came to the world...]
Joshua| Boy, Jake left a scar on my head the size of a nickel. I'll have to wear a hat now, Margaret.
Margaret|  Well, I think you'll look good in one.  Are you sure having him next to Jermaine is safe? We don't even know what he is. 
Joshua| Of course we do, dear. He's our boy.
Margaret| That he is.
Joshua| Yes, we've got one boy that I gave birth to and one boy that you gave birth to. Let's never tell him how it happened.
Margaret| Agreed.
Jake| And so they never told me.
Finn| Never told you what?
Jake| I don't know. They never told me. Ha!
Nurse Pound Cake|  What's her condition, Dr. Ice Cream?
Dr. Ice Cream|  She's totally gross over 90% of her body. The other 10% is crazy nasty.
Nurse Pound Cake|  Will she make it, Doctor?
Dr. Ice Cream|   I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake.  Put sugar on 'er! Two scoops!  We're losing 'er!!
Ice King|  No! Not my number one! Princess, if you die on me, I will never forgive you! I'll be lost—lost in my own emotional labyri—
Finn|   YAAAAAH!!
Dr. Ice Cream|  Wait, Finn!
Finn|   What!?
Dr. Ice Cream|  Her sugar levels are stabilizing.
Princess Bubblegum|   Yes, I'm fine. I just need to rest.
Ice King|   Oh, my wife! Is there anything weird about her? I can't see through these pain tears!
Dr. Ice Cream|  She's fine. Why?
Ice King|  It's just that... after Princess fell into the well, I saw something strange happen. Something I still don't understand.  Ooh—AGH! Wait! Listen to me!!
Finn|  NO! Just shut your mouth, old man!
Ice King|"  ""Old man?"" Heh! What? I'm not old."
Jake|  Uh, yeah, you are, dude.
Ice King|  Old? I'm... I see. It's all making sense now. Brrrrapapo!  I'm going, Princess. I'm sorry if my skin grossed you out. Nobody wants to see this old skin, I guess.  Nobody in the world.
Finn|   JUST GET OUT OF HERE!!
Ice King|  Peace.
Finn|  Sorry about that, Peebles.
Princess Bubblegum|  The ice wizard is a weak fool....
Jake|  Huh?
Raggedy Princess|   Finn! Finn! The other princesses and I made you a new backpack!
Finn|  Whoa, Raggedy Princess! It's so awesome! Thank you.
Raggedy Princess|   You're welcome, Finn! 
Jake|   You look like sick, grey meat, but we're gonna jack you up so awesome.
Finn|  We should wheel 'er to her bedroom, right?
Jake|  Yeah, man, and then we'll do magic tricks.
Finn|  Like fake magic?
Jake|  Yeah, like  bruh bruh bruh, bruh...
Finn and Jake|  Princess... Princess...  Surprise!
Finn|  We picked every flower in the Candy Kingdom just for you! 
Jake|  Whoo-oo!
Finn|  Princess Bubblegum?
Jake|  Oh, jeez!!  What's wrong with Princess Bubblegum?!
Finn|   Quiet, dude. We're supposed to take care of her, not make her feel bad!
Jake|  I know, man, but she just seems... weird.
Finn|  She's just messed up from the accident, man. We just have to take care of her 'til she feels better.
Jake|  Uh... Okay, dude.
Finn|  Princess! Princess, no! You shouldn't be out of bed!  Princess... I... I gotta tell ya somethin'. Uh... Jake... 
Jake|  Oh. Gotcha. I'll go get some tea! 
Finn|  Princess... this sweater you made me kept me safe. I almost got super messed up, but... it saved me. And I wanted to say... thank you for imbuing this sweater with the power of liking someone a lot. Because... I like you a lot.   Haha, uh... We shouldn't talk about this now. You should rest.
Princess Bubblegum|   Finn... I need you to get me some things...
Finn|  Yes, Princess.
Peppermint Butler|   Princess! I brought you some tea—
Jake|  Whoa...  Uh... somethin' weird's goin' on...
Finn|   Jake!
Jake|   AH!
Finn|  I'm gonna get some stuff for PB. Be right back.
Jake|   Hey... Princess... Sorry you're not feelin' good. .] Oh! I'll sing you a song! You love it when I sing songs!
Jake|  Uh...  Uh, this song's not that good. It's a bad one. I... I'm stoppin'.  ...And starting a new song!   AAH... 
Princess Bubblegum|   Jake...
Jake|  AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!  OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB, OH, MY GLOB!!  Maybe the toxic waste did somethin' to her brain—made her have demon powers—or somethin’!  Yo, dude! Wait! What's all that biz?!
Finn|  Uh, bleach, lighter fluid, ammonia, gasoline, I dunno. Lady stuff. Plutonium...
Jake|  No, man... no... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Princess Bubblegum|   Thanks. 
Finn|  No probs!
Jake|  Wait! Hold on!
Finn|  What's up?
Jake|  Listen... PB's bed was on fire.
Finn|  What?! Is she okay?!
Jake|   She made it on fire.
Finn|  With a match?
Jake|  No, man. With her brain... I think...  Look, man, I'll show you!
Finn|  Jake, wh—
Jake|  Shh!!  P-P-P-Princess...?
Finn|   Over there!  PB? You in there?
Princess Bubblegum|   I'm busy!
Finn|  See? It's fine. She's just havin' private time.
Jake|  I'm lookin' in! 
Finn|  JAKE, WHAT THE HEY?!
Jake|  Oh, my gloob!
Finn|   Come on, man, that's pervy!
Jake|  You don't even know, man.
Finn|  DUDE?!
Jake|  Look!  See it!
Finn|  Hold on, Peebles!  PRINCESS!  AAH! PUT DOWN THE TUB!
Gumball Guardian|  Evil presence detected!!  Must defend!!
Ice King|   Hey, Finn, are you dead or what?
Finn|   Whaaah?... Ice King? What are you doing here?
Ice King|  Hey. I had to keep an eye on the princess because she's being possessed by the Lich.
Finn|   You don't know that.
Ice King|  But I do. I saw it with my wizard eyes!  In the well, I saw something come out of the Lich and go into the princess. But I wasn't sure it was real  because when you have stanky old wizard eyes, sometimes you see things that are real, and other times it's like crazy crazy crazy in your face all the time!   All the time...  Guys, let me help you. I don't want my future wife to be... physically unattractive.
Finn|  Listen, you old poot. I'm not going to let you kill 'er twice. GET STUFFED. Come on, Jake.
Finn|  We're coming, Princess!
Jake|  Dude! I think we should let the Ice King help! He can freeze her, which could buy us some t—
Finn|  Dump that mess! I'mma set 'er free with my like-like sweater!
Jake|  Woooh, do it! 
Finn|  I like you, Princess!!
Jake|  Finn!!
Finn|  Urrgh...  Liking her... didn't work. She's unstoppable... unless...   Ice King, I... I need you to freeze Princess Bubblegum. Will you help me?
Ice King|   Are you suuuuure?
Finn|   Yes.
Ice King|  Great! Weeee! 
Finn|  I'll distract 'er up top, you freeze 'er legs!
Ice King|   Wah!
Finn|  I'M A CAT! I'M AN AGILE CAT! JAKE! DUCK!  MEOW, ICE KING!  Thanks, bird!
Ice King|  Yeah! Whoopie!
Finn|  You did good, Ice King.
Ice King|  Oh, yeah?
Finn|  Yeah, man.
Ice King|  Okay. I didn't kill 'er this time. Everybody saw that, right?
Gumball Guardian|   Duuuude...
Finn|  We gotta get 'er to the hospital!
Dr. Ice Cream|  Start assembling! Here, try to connect these two pieces!  Turn it...  Perfect.  Give me more pieces, Doctor Princess!
Dr. Princess|  That's all we have, Dr. Ice Cream!
Dr. Ice Cream|  What?! That can't be!
Nurse Pound Cake|   What do we do, Doctor?
Dr. Ice Cream|   ...I don't know, Nurse Pound Cake.
Finn|  I hope she's okay...
Nurse Pound Cake|  Attention, everyone...
Finn|   IS PB OKAY?!?
Nurse Pound Cake|  Yes... but there were some complications.
Finn|  NOOOOOOO!!!!
Nurse Pound Cake|  Yes... I'm afraid... there wasn't enough gum to work with, so it appears Princess Bubblegum is now...... younger.  She's 13 years old now.
Ice King|  Aw, dang it! Well, I'm outta here. Goodbye, everyone. 
Finn|  13 years old? That's how old I am.  Uh...
Jake|   Whoa...
Princess Bubblegum|   Give me a hug, hero.
One-eyed Koala| Yam! Yam!
Two other Koalas| Nyam.
One-eyed Koala| Yam.
Martin|  That's right, you silly guards. Stay distracted, talking to each other.
Martin| And when you least expect it, old Martin is gonna steal those gold helmets off your heads and use them for betting on lard fights. The very thing that got me imprisoned here in the first place.
Guard 1|  It's not as bad as you—
Guard 3| Hey, you two mugs, be on the lookout for rebels.
Martin| Whoa! Nice. Time to enact my genius plan. 
Large prisoner| Huh?! 
Guard 3| Huh?!
Martin| Here comes the rascal!  Whoa! 
Martin| Whoa! 
One-eyed Koala| Nyam.
Small Koala| Nyam.
Martin| Hey.
Martin| This is your rebel village? I am honored.  Uh, say, you dudes hungry? I'm a little peckish.
Small Koala| Nyam, nyam?
Martin| What's a fella got to do, right?
Martin| Hey, wait a sec. Whoa! 
Flame Messenger| Whoo-hoo!
Flame Princess| Next.
Flame Person| Oh, Your Highness, can you help my poor child? His hair is starting to go, and we can't afford flame care and... 
Flame Princess| Take this fortifier. It should last you through the cold season. 
Flame Person| Oh, Glob bless thy soul! 
Ursula| More tea, Your Highness?
Flame Princess|  Thank you.
Ursula| Mm-hmm.
Flame Princess| Who's next?
Flame Person| Hi, um, my microwave seems to be broken, and—  aah!
Flame Lord|  Flame Princess!
Flame Princess| Don John—the Flame Lord!
Don John| I fear you're not evil enough to rule the kingdom.
Flame Princess| Excuse me? How dare you!   What?
Flame Princess| You've been poisoning me. How could you, Ursula? Guards!
Flame Princess| Huh?
Flame King|  Oh, here he comes!
Flame Princess| No!
Flame King|  Yes! Playtime's over, honey. Time to give Daddy his throne back.  I've secretly arranged to make Don John my vizier and give him my daughter's hand in marriage.
Flame Lord| Uh, yeah, I know.
Flame King| Ha-ha!
Flame Lord| Hwah!
Flame King|  Man, you're looking shredded.
Flame Lord| My gym is dark magic, and my protein shake is rage.
Flame King| Okay, okay. 
Flame King| Splendid work, Don John.
Flame Lord| No big D, bro.
Flame King| Heavens to Betsy!
Flame Princess| Cinnamon Bun!
Flame King| Don't let them escape!
Flame Lord| Come here, girl. We're getting hitched!
Cinnamon Bun| No!  Go away!
Flame Princess| I can't leave. I have to fight for my kingdom!
Cinnamon Bun| No. Fight later. Now we get help.
Flame King| Huh? Aah! 
Flame Lord| Hwah! 
Flame King| Why did I jump?
Flame Princess| Thanks, CB.
Cinnamon Bun|  You're welcome. How are you feeling?
Flame Princess| A little better, I think.
Cinnamon Bun| Who should we go to for help? Princess Bubblegum?
Both| Nah.
Flame Princess| I don't trust her.
Cinnamon Bun| Yeah, she's devious.
Flame Princess| Well, I've seen Finn battle huge monsters and even armies, and we need somebody who can fight... CB, take me to Finn.
Cinnamon Bun| Mmm, okay.
Finn| Waah!
Flame Princess| Finn!
Finn| Um...  hey. Uh, Jake isn't here. He's sleeping over at Lady Rainicorn's maybe.
Flame Princess| Finn, I've been slowly poisoned by my treacherous handmaiden. Now my powers are weakened, and—and the Flame Lord has freed my father and threatened to marry me. But I escaped with CB.
Finn| Oh, what?! I'll help you. I'll do anything for you.
Flame Princess| Listen, Finn, this doesn't mean we're getting back together. We're all business.
Finn| Mm-hmm. Of course.
Cinnamon Bun| Yeah, business.
Flame Princess|  I'm feeling exhausted. Where can I freshen up?
Finn|  Girls' bathroom is over there. Also, it's the boys' bathroom.
Flame Princess| Oh, thanks. 
Finn| So, what do you think, CB? You think I still have a shot with her, right?
Cinnamon Bun|  No.
Finn| Does she ever talk about me? Is she seeing anybody?
Cinnamon Bun| No and no.
Finn|" ""No and no,"" she does talk about me, or ""no and no,"" she isn't seeing anybody?"
Flame Princess| Alright, guys, let's wolf.
Finn| So... your Fire Wolf can fly.
Cinnamon Bun| Yep. I taught him.
Finn| Hmm.  Whoa! You've cooled down a lot.
Flame Princess| No funny stuff.
Finn| Things have been going great for me lately. Been hanging out with my boys. I got a cursed sword arm now, so that's new. Yeah, I've been exercising a lot and taking some piano lessons—trying to improve myself. Not dating anybody or anything, just getting a little me time, being the best Finn I can be. 
Cinnamon Bun|  Hyup! 
Finn| Oh, no!
Finn| I hid my flameproof suit behind these rocks... just in case, whatever, you know?
Cinnamon Bun|  So, the guards are posted here and here, so we should probably sneak in here. 
Finn| Suited! 
Cinnamon Bun| Uh...
Finn| Remember my fire suit? Hey, CB, you did a great job getting us here and everything,  but I got this, all right?
Finn| I got a sword arm, so—
Cinnamon Bun| Yeah, you said that.
Finn| Watch this.  Hey, guards! Come at me at the same time!
Flame Princess|  What are you doing?!
Finn| Let's go, Princess! 
Cinnamon Bun| But that wasn't the plan! No!
Finn| Ha-ha!
Flame Guard|  It's the princess.
Flame Guards| Capture them!
Finn|  Ahhhhhh—
Flame Princess| No, Finn, don't hurt them! They're entranced!
Finn|  Oh, right.  Oh, no.
Flame Guards| Captured.
Cinnamon Bun|   Hyah! Um...  
Finn| There's CB!
Flame Guard| Get that bun!
Cinnamon Bun| Could you move, please?
Flame Guard| Whoo, get him, boys! We're taking these two away.
Finn| Don't worry, FP, your boy Finn won't fail you.
Flame Guard|  Put up your dukes. You have permission to leave when you out-duke us.
Cinnamon Bun| Okay.
Flame Guards| Duke! Duke! Duke!
Cinnamon Bun| Duke! Uh, duke!  These two are out-duked! Now I'm making my escape. 
Finn| Trust me. It'll be fine.
Flame Lord| For soon you shall be mine.  If you've forgotten, I'm reminding you now.
Flame Princess| Never!
Finn| Yeah! It's because you secretly still have feelings for me.
Flame Princess| No!
Finn|  Hmm.
Flame Princess|  I can never marry you, because I don't even know you, much less like you, and forcing me to marry you is gross.
Flame King| Whoo! Whoo! Man, I love staring out over things. Whoo!  It's so good to be king.
Flame Lord| You said she'd do whatever you told her.
Flame King| Umm, okay...
Flame Lord| But she refuses to marry me. She's her own woman, you liar!
Flame King| Liar? You want to fight me?
Flame Lord| Aye—fistfight. 
Flame King| Yes... I'll fistfight you. Come on! 
Flame Lord| You hit me? Felt good! 
Flame King| Oof! I love fistfighting.  You dirty bread breaker. 
Flame Lord| Aah! 
Flame Lord| Put them down.  Put your dukes down.
Flame King| No! 
Finn & Flame Princess| Whaa?
Finn & Flame Princess| We're saved!
Cinnamon Bun| Hi.  Got a key.
Flame Lord| Fight! 
Flame King| Fight! 
Cinnamon Bun| They're distracted. Let's go!
Flame King|  Leg press!
Flame Lord|  Stamina... failing.
Flame Lord| Cheater!
Cinnamon Bun| Onward, Jake 2!
Cinnamon Bun| Aah!
Flame Princess| CB, are you okay?
Flame Lord|  
Female Flame Person| Huh? What happened?
Male Flame Person| Should—should we keep attacking?
Cinnamon Bun| Stop! You were all brainwashed... by him! 
Flame King| Uh-oh.
Female Flame Person| Hey, I don't like that guy!
Male Flame Person| Yeah, let's get him!
Cinnamon Bun| Capture him!
Flame King| It wasn't me. It was Don John!  Aah!
Flame Princess|  
Flame Lord| Huh?  Oh... 
Flame Lord| Aah!
Flame King| Have you all gone dumb from Don John's magic? I mean, how do you expect this softy to rule you? She's even weaker than before from being poisoned. Look!
Flame Princess| Oh, come on.
Cinnamon Bun| You're wrong. Flame Princess may not be the most ruthless of all despots, but she is strong where it really counts—in her heart. And that is good.
Cinnamon Bun| I have learned so much watching this beautiful woman work, and with her example, I have become a better man. I will be by her side as her champion and knight every step of the way because... I love her.
Flame Princess| Thank you.
Flame Person| Aw, how sweet!
Finn| Jeez. Did I just get shown up by Cinnamon Bun?
Finn|   Stunts!  Hi-ya!  Yeah!
Jake|  Yo, Finn, look what I found!  A vertical trampoline! It's sticky!
Finn|  Dude, it's a spider web.
Jake|  Ohh. Well, cut me out, yo!
Finn|  No way, I'll stunt you out! Whoah!  ...I was thinking something else would happen.
Jake|  You got anything sharp?
Finn|  The only sharp thing I had was my fingernails, but you made me cut them.
Jake|  They were too long, Finn.
Jake|  Augh! You broke the skin, dude!
Finn|  I guess my fingernails are really loaaeaeuAAAAHH--! 
Finn|  Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Jake|  It's cool, man.
Finn|  Can you... stretch us out of here?
Jake|  I'm gonna take a nap while you grow out your fingernails. We'll make our escape when I wake up.
Bug|  You'll never escape!  We'll all die in the web.
Fly|  That's the circle of life.
Finn|  That's not a circle. That's, like, a straight line.
Bug|  We don't make the rules, man.
Finn|  Well, don't just give up.
Bug and Fly in unison|  The spiders are back!
Fly|  Try to stay calm. Greet your fate with dignity.
Finn|  We gotta go, Jake! Jake!
Barb|  So what? You're not talking to me now?
Ed|  No, I'm just tired of setting traps all day, solo-style.
Barb|  Why are you mad?
Ed|  I just said I was tired.
Barb|  But you're acting like you're mad.
Ed|  I'm not mad. Oh, look, food... that I caught... in my web... for us.
Barb|  I spin webs, too, Ed.
Ed|  Yeah, I know.
Barb|  I try just as hard as you.
Ed|  Well, go ahead then. Wrap them up for laters.  What's wrong, Barb?
Finn|  What's going on there, Jake? 
Barb|  I can't! You think I'm gross when I spin my web!
Ed|  What?
Barb|  I can see it on your face! Tell me that you don't!
Ed|  Uhh... I uh... You tell me, you don't find me gross!
Barb|  Oh, get stuffed, Ed! 
Finn|  You guys are sad.  Ugh! What is that sound? Sick, dude! She makes that sound, too?
Ed|  Yeah, I guess, but she never does it in front of me.  Anyway, it's not gross when guys do it.
Finn|  Dude, that's not cool. You need to think about what you say and how that affects your lady.
Ed|  How about how she affects me? I love her, man.
Jake|   Oh, snap, how long was I out?
Ed|  Can someone tell me why we fight, why she treats me like all I do is make her feel bad? Tell me, Glob, why don't you ever answer me!?
Bug|  It's hard to step outside of yourself when you're enmeshed with another being. . Oh, Grod! It's over! It's over!!
Finn|  Wait!
Ed|  What?
Finn|  Umm...  Right now, we gotta real-talk about your girlfriend.
Ed|  I don't real-talk with my food.
Finn|  Uhh...  We real-talk now, or you're going to be as single as your stinky web squirter!
Ed|  Yeah, right. You just wanna get out of my web. All you ever want to do is escape! You're always, like, in cahoots, makin' plans not to be food.
Finn|  I'm not in cahoots!
Ed|  So okay, eat your friend here. 
Finn|   Okay.
Bug|  No, man! What?! Where's your heart?! Look inside yourself! This isn't you!
Finn|   I'm gonna fake eat you, man.
Bug|   Oh. Word.
Bug|   Noooo! Oh, my guts! My guts everywhere! Agh, how could you!
Ed|   Okay, man, you've earned my trust. So, let's do this. Real-talk me, bro! 
Finn|   Okay, first off, then, how you're going about this isn't working. Am I right?
Ed|  Ugh, yeah. It's not working. My way sucks.
Finn|   Cool, now we've gotta do damage control. Healing the negs energy at the source.
Ed|  Yes, heal the neg-jerseys in me.
Finn|   Alright, uhh...
Finn|   Go find Barb a present. That'll fix the first neg. Can you do that?
Ed|  Yeah, I can find her a present. If you think that'll help. I don't think it will, but what do I know, I'm just a big ol' dummy who does everything wrong... 
Bug|  Whee!
Finn|  You're free!  Aw, man.
Jake|  It's okay, Finn. You bought us some time.
Finn|  Yeah, think fast, what can we use?
Jake|  There's nothing! Just a bunch of nature.
Finn|  I have a dumb idea.
Ed|   Get her a present. Harumph. When was the last time she got me a present? What would she want, anyway? How do I know, we never talk. Jeez, what happened to my life? All my friends are gone. They all got kids now. I don't have kids. All I have is Barb. And she...  treats me like a--a dingus! Wha... Oh, cool! A sword!  Wow, neat!  It's magic or something! We can hang this up over our mantle and snuggle by the fire, huh, like we--like we used to! I'm gonna fix us, Barb! Fix us!
Jake|  Alright, one... two... three!
Bird 1|  Yo what?
Finn|  Shoot!
Jake|  Here comes another one. One two three!
Bird 2|  My eyes! Agh!! 
Finn|  Ha ha, yes! Finally! 
Jake|  Good job! Last chance for life. Break out!
Finn|   Yeah, you mommy!
Barb|  Hey, what's going on here! 
Finn|  Nothing.  Oh, crab apples!
Barb|  Where's Ed?
Finn|"  Oh, uh, he's getting you an ""I'm sorry"" gift."
Jake|  He feels crazy about making you cry.
Barb|  He does? Really?
Ed|  Barb! Barb!
Barb|  Ed?
Ed|  Barb, look! Damage control! Check it out! I wrapped it up and everything!
Barb|  Oh, Ed, I can't believe it!
Ed|  Yeah! Come on, open it!
Barb|  I really just, it's just so unlike you to--  What's this?
Ed|  It's a sword! I found it in the woods!
Barb|  In the woods?
Ed|  Yeah, it's magical, though. Check out the blade!
Barb|  You got this for you, Ed.
Ed|  No, I got it for us! For snuggles by the fire!
Barb|  We are never gonna snuggles until you learn to appreciate me! 
Ed|  Oh, really? Well, I guess we're never gonna eat again either 'cause I catch the food, and your butt is dysfunctional! Eeh-ya!  Go! Run away, food! We don't need you apparently! 
Bug|  Just break up, you guys!
Fly|  Do it for you!
Ed|  Now what are you gonna eat? Huh, Barb?
Barb|   I'm gonna eat you!
Finn|  Yo, that's wrong!
Barb|  Who cares!
Jake|  We're free!
Jake|  Oh, no. You got that look on your face. You going back to help that fool?
Finn|  His wife's gonna eat him!
Jake|  Spider marriage is complicated. Sometimes, you just gotta mind your own biz.
Ed|   Oh, help, somebody help me!
Jake|  Ugh... Go with Glob.
Ed|  Mercy!
Barb|  You little twerp! Are you stupid or something?
Finn|  Yeah, I'm stupid. But I know something real. You shouldn't eat your husband!
Jake|   Yo, smoothin' things out?
Finn|  Not exactly...
Ed|   Barb! Barb! What's wrong, my love?  Okay ...
Finn|  What is happening!?
Jake|  Something we're not supposed to see.
Barb|  Oh, Ed. We're parents!
Finn|  Aw, sick!
Ed|  I think there's hope for us, Barb.
Barb|  We can make a new start, as a family. 
Jake|  Nice.
Finn|  Think they're gonna make it?
Jake|  Love like theirs will always find a way. It'll crawl all up over you and drain your body fluids, poisoning you slowly until you pass out.  Circle of life, Finn... circle of life.
Root Beer Guy| Fearlessly, Captain Root Beer Guy charges across the battlefield. The ancient sleeper raises his power staff to attack. With one lever pull, Captain Root Beer Guy saves the...
Cherry Cream Soda| Root Beer Guy!
Cherry Cream Soda| One day at a time.
Cherry Cream Soda| Okay, Loafy, just a second.
Chery Cream Soda|  Hmm?
Chery Cream Soda| Hello?
Chery Cream Soda| Root Beer Guy?
Starchy| Nope. Starchy. You do this every morning.
Chery Cream Soda| I know. I'm sorry, honey. I'm trying, but I can't stop thinking about him.
Starchy| Look, we've been married two months already. I love you, baby, but isn't there an expiration date to this grieving thing?
Chery Cream Soda| I don't think it works that way.
Chery Cream Soda| Starchy, dear, could you feed the cat later? I've got to prep a witness tonight.
Starchy| Anything for my Chery Cream Soda and her sweet, little kitty cat.  Oh! I'll win your heart someday, Loafy. We can't all be a cute, little character with a cure, little straw sticking out of our cute, little head.But take some advice from an old grave digger, huh? Maybe it's time to do something with that. Here a thought... I could bury this for you. An unmarked grave kind of thing. Just... sswt!... Toss him in there with whoever.
Chery Cream Soda| Well, that's... that seems macabre. But sweet. I'll think about it.
Starchy| Okay, okay.  See you tonight.
Chery Cream Soda| Looks like it's gonna rain. Don't forget your umbrella, Starchy.
Starchy| Ooh, thanks. Maybe I'll take my hoe in case things set sloppy. Well, bye again.
Chery Cream Soda| Bye.
Princess Bubblegum| You two are married.
Chery Cream Soda| Good bye, Root Beer Guy
Chery Cream Soda| Good Morning, husband.
Starchy| Good morning, wife.
Chery Cream Soda| Shaving your 'stache?
Starchy| Uh-huh.
Chery Cream Soda| Aaaaahhhh! Starchy! What? What?
Starchy| Blazes mazes! What is going on?
Chery Cream Soda| I saw him. He was right outside.
Starchy| Who? Finn? Jake? Candy person number 22?
Chery Cream Soda| Maybe I can still catch him...
Dirt Beer Guy| Hi, sweetie. I was dead, but I came back to life. That was really something. Hmm.
Starchy| It's okay, baby. Starchy's here.
Chery Cream Soda| Oh, thank heavens. It was just another hallucina-a-tion.
Dirt Beer Guy| Honey, I'm fairly upset that you remarried.
Chery Cream Soda| But how is ths possible? You were zapped by Darren, the ancient sleeper. Your dome was cracked. Your root beer soaked into the ground. I buried you remains in a mason jar, which is now your head. And... and... and now I'm with Starchy. I mean we're... we're legally married. You're legally dead. Not that I want to sound obsessed with legalities, but I am a lawyer.
Dirt Beer Guy|" Hey, where's that little statue I got you? It said,""I wuv you,"" on the base of it. It was a little bear with his arms out like this."
Dirt Beer Guy|" He was all, ""I wuv you, I wuv you, I wuv you."""
Starchy| No sudden moves, baby. He's got freaky zombie strength.
Dirt Beer Guy|" Maybe it's up here.  Did you hire a maid service or something while I was gone? I sure hope they didn't throw out the ""I wuv you"" bear."
Starchy| Enough! I should have put you in the ground a long time ago!
Dirt Beer Guy| Hey, I came back for her.
Cherry Cream Soda| Root Beer Guy, if that is you in there, I'm so pround of you. But this isn't fair. You endend our life together when you pulled that lever. You made the choice, and you saved the kingdom. But you lost me.
Starchy| Heh, Burn.
Dirt Beer Guy| Cherry Cream Soda, I still wuv you... whoa!
Dirt Beer Guy| You always wanted this wall knocked down anyway, right?  Ooh.
Cherry Cream Soda| Oooh! Wah! You come back with no explanation, wreck up the place, and you expect to just pick up where we left off? Get out of my house!
Dirt Beer Guy| I'm sorry.
Starchy| Starchy wins!
Jake| That's funny.
Starchy| I can't believe you used to be married to such a freak.
Cherry Cream Soda| He isn't a freak. Or he didn't used to be.
Starchy| Shh, shh, shh, shh. Don't worry, honey.
Cherry Cream Soda| Don't touch me now, please. I need time to think.
Starchy| Look, baby. Starchy knows all the fresh windows in town, and Starchy chose you. Starchy wuvs you.
Starchy| It's time to dig a hole.
Dirt Beer Guy| I thought she'd be happy to see me, but it was a disaster. I didn't know where to pick up with her, so of course I just acted like a goof. Oh, and now I'm one of the undead, I guess.
Jake| Hey, man, there's absolutely nothing wrong with you.
Lady Rainicorn|  그래, 그리고 좀비가 뜨는 거 알지? 특히 요즘들어 말이야. 
Dirt Beer Guy|  She's got a point though. I was the one who wanted to be the big hero, and I got my wish. But I didn't think about her enough. I'm not even thinking about her right now.
Jake| Yes, you are.
Dirt Beer Guy| I am?
Jake| Run back and tell her all the stuff you've been telling us. Maybe you could pick up from a place you Haven't been yet.
Dirt Beer Guy| I don't know what that means, but it sounds very encouraging! See you guys later
Jake| He didn't bite you, did he?
Dirt Beer Guy| Cherry Cream Soda! Cherry Cream Soda! I've had a revelation of some kind.
Starchy| No dirt-heads allowed.
Dirt Beer Guy| Uh, but I have to talk to Cherry Cream Soda.
Starchy| Oh, no you don't. Nuh-uh.
Dirt Beer Guy| I'm trying to be polite.
Dirt Beer Guy| Oh, dear. Hmm. Pardon me!
Starchy| It's on zombie.
Cherry Cream Soda| What the heck?
Starchy| You have met your match, freaky dirt guy! Woo-woo-woo-woo!
Dirt Beer Guy| Look, will you give me a break?
Starchy| Too chicken, huh? Look, I'll put the slovels down. See? Hah!
Dirt Beer Guy| This is childish.
Starchy| Ha!
Dirt Beer Guy| Get away from my head!
Starchy| Ho-ho!
Starchy| We have some unfinished business. Wait for me, Little Dirt Beer!
Starchy| Ooh is somebody afraid of old Starchy?
Dirt Beer Guy| I'm afraid of killing you.
Starchy| Oh, boo-hoo. Don't hurt me!
Dirt Beer Guy| Ugh. Is it not possible to get away from you?
Starchy| I'm escorting you to your new home... Far away from my house.
Dirt Beer Guy| It's not even your house.
Starchy| Ha! It's practically mine.
Starchy| Tonight you'll sleep in a hole... The same dirty grave hole from whence you sprang!
Dirt Beer Guy| I'm not usually violent, but you pushed me.
Dirt Beer Guy| Nah. What's this?
Dirt Beer Guy| Okay, now we're talking. Poke me with a shovel now,  you mustache face.
Starchy| Aw.
Cherry Cream Soda| Stop it, both of you. Neither of you thought to ask me what I want. I've made a decision who I want to be with.
Cherry Cream Soda| I don't want to be with either of you.
Starchy| What?!
Cherry Cream Soda| You're a maniac. I can't believe I ever got that low.
Starchy| Mmm! Starchy doesn't need this.
Cherry Cream Soda| And you. I don't know you anymore.
Dirt Beer Guy| Okay. Take care of yourself.
Cherry Cream Soda|" I said ""I don't know you,"" but I'd like to. Would you like to go on a date?"
Dirt Beer Guy| Yee!  I mean, yes. This is weird, right?
Cherry Cream Soda| Well we've never actually dated before. We got married so fast.
Dirt Beer Guy| Let's take it show this time around.
Cherry Cream Soda| One date at a time.
Jake|  Hey, man, it's Couples Only Movie Night tonight. Who are you bringin'?
Finn|  I don't know. Who are you bringin'?
Jake|  I'm bringing my girlfriend, dude.
Finn|  Oh.
Finn|  I'll take this duck!
Jake|  It's couples night! You gotta bring someone you can smooch.
Finn|  Man, I don't want to be smooched!
Jake|  Don't have to smooch. You just have to bring someone you can smooch. It's, like, the rules.
Finn|  Lame.  Ah! Well, I'll take this blanket! 
Jake|"  Put the blanket down.  Have a seat. I want to explain some ""things"" to you about couples."
Jake|  You all square?
Finn|  Yeah, yeah.
Jake|  Who you gonna call?
Finn|  I'm going to call a girl I don't have to kiss. 
Princess Bubblegum|   Hello?
Finn|  Hi Princess! Would you go to Couples Movie Night with me?
Princess Bubblegum|  Sounds romantic, Finn.
Finn|  No! I was just wondering if you wanted to go with me. 
Princess Bubblegum|  No, sorry, Finn. I'm busy practicing for the Whistling Choir Death Match Championship.
Finn|  But—
Princess Bubblegum|  Auf Wiedersehen! 
Finn|  She doesn't want to go!
Jake|  Yes she does! We just need to help her realize that she wants to go to the movies with you.  I'm calling Marceline.
Finn|  What?
Jake|   Look, man, I've been learning a lot about vampires lately. I realized my fear was based on ignorance!
Marceline|  Speak.
Jake|  Hey, hey, Marceline. Got a favor to ask, Babe. We've gotta make Princess Bubblegum jealous, so she'll go to the movies with Finn.  Marceline? Come in. Hello? 
Finn|  Hehe. Are you gonna help us?
Marceline|  Yeah, I'll help. It'll be funny.
Jake|  Okay, so here's the plan.  You start saying things and  you start laughing waaay loud. And then Bubblegum...  will get jealous of you . Which will awaken her Finn love! You start us off.
Finn|  Um... hmm funny... funny... giddy up?
Finn|  Hehe. Um... diggy diggy?
Finn|  Diggy diggy!  Diggy diggy!
Princess Bubblegum|  Greetings, Finn.  Hey, Marceline...
Marceline|   Hello, Bonnibel.
Princess Bubblegum|   Yeah, yeah. So, what's so funny, Finn?
Finn|  I, um... uh... it's... something.
Princess Bubblegum|  Well, then, keep it down out there! I'm trying to whistle practice! 
Jake|  That was great! Now, we begin Phase 2! It's so powerful! Wait here! Hehehe... 
Marceline|  Hey, look, Finn, I know Jake's your friend and all, but... if you really want Bubblegum to go to the movies with you, you've gotta like, stop taking advice from your dog and take some advice from a real girl!
Finn|  But Jake said Phase 2 is powerful!
Marceline|   How is Jake going to know what girls want more than a real girl?
Finn|  Yeah...
Marceline|  Okay great. So what we need now is something... fun! Girls love fun more than anything. Fun, fun, fun! If you can show Princess Bubblegum you're fun, she'll deffs wanna go to the movies with you.
Finn|  Haha, you said fun so much, it sounds all weird now. Fun. F—
Marceline|  So... what do you like to do for fun, Finn?
Finn|  Oh, Oh! I like to wrestle! And fight!  But girls don't like that.
Marceline|  No, no, that's perfect! All you need to do is get in there and wrestle Princess Bubblegum to show her how fun you are. 
Finn|  Ffffffuuunnn. Ffffuuunn. 
Jake|  Whoa, where you going, man? Check it out!
Finn|  What is that stuff?
Jake|  It's a lute-suit! Girls love it! Trust me.
Marceline|  Finn! What the plum are you wearing? You look horrible!
Jake|  It's a lute-suit! And Finn looks adorable in it!
Marceline|  Well, it's going to ruin the plan.
Jake|  What she talking about, Finn?
Finn|  Well... I was going to give Marceline's plan a try, too.
Jake|  Her idea?! What's wrong with my idea? 
Princess Bubblegum|   Oh, hey, Finn! Did'ya ever find some—Whoa! What are you wearing?
Finn|  Oh... this is my... Lute... suit.
Finn|  Oh.  This is my lute-suit!
Princess Bubblegum|   Finn, that is hilarious!  Oh, you are killing me! 
Marcelince|  Psst! 
Finn|  Oh, yeah!  So... Headlock! 
Princess Bubblegum| Guards!
Marceline|  That suit was ridiculous.
Jake|  Ridi—Ridiculous? What? Can you believe this girl, Finn? Huh? Can ya?
Finn|  Uh... I guess the suit did feel... a little silly.
Jake|  Well, fine! You can just give it back then!
Finn|  I'm sorry!
Jake|  Good luck getting to that movie without my help! Ruff. 
Marceline|  Gee, he seems pretty ticked.
Finn|  Naw, he just needs some spaghetti.
Marceline|  Oh, okay. Well taste this, then. I've gotta a new plan.
Finn|  Really?
Marceline|  The only thing women like more than fun is excitement! She needs to feel her blood pump, man! She needs to... be chased by wolves!
Finn|  Like metaphorically?
Marceline|  Come on, I'll teach ya how to show a girl a good time. Wraps Finn's arms around her.] Hold tight. You ready?
Finn|  Uhh...  Mhmm.
Marceline|  Shhh! She's probably asleep!
Finn|  This was a really good idea.
Marceline|   Now don't blow it this time!
Finn|  Haha, okay.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, Finn, thank goodness you're here! There's wolves in my room!
Finn|  Yeah, I know! I put them there! Pretty exciting, right? Heh heh.
Princess Bubblegum|   I'm sorry to do this, Finn. But until you stop acting like a psycho, you're forbidden from entering the Candy Kingdom. Farewell. 
Finn|  I don't understand, Marceline. I tried everything. I guess she just doesn't like me. 
Marceline|  Shhh. Come on, Finn, a brainlord like Bonnie? You'll be bored with her in a week! And anyway I, for one, think you're pretty great.  Sorry it didn't work out the way you wanted. See you later, I guess! 
Finn|  Marceline! Of course! It's been Marceline all along!
Jake|  Hey, man, I've been looking for you. Sorry for acting like a dweeb before. Want some leftover spaghetti?
Finn|  Ah, no, thanks, man. But I really need your help!
Jake|  'Bout time!
Marceline|  Uh-oh.
Finn|  Marceline! Will you go to the movies with me?!
Marceline|  We need to talk...
Finn|   Good evening my dear, your escort is here!
Marceline|  Finn, you do NOT want to go down that road with me.
Finn|  With you, I would walk down any road, m'lady. Especially, if it leads to the movies.
Marceline|  Oh, yeah? No one would want to go to the movies with...  this!  What do you think of me now?
Finn|  How do you like your popcorn?
Marceline|  Uuugh!  You're starting to annoy me!
Finn|  Well then let's do something fun, like go to the movies!
Marceline|  Get off me!  Finn, I like you, but I—
Finn|  Headlock! 
Marceline|  No!  Listen to me. I'm not going to go to the movies with you! I just don't like you... that way.
Marceline|  I'm sorry Finn, I just... I don't wanna date you.
Finn|  Date me? Man, I just wanna go to the movies. But everybody hates me.
Marceline|  Wait, you don't want me to be your girlfriend?
Finn|  Huh? No! Movies!
Marceline|  If you weren't looking for a girlfriend then why were you romancing it up all day?
Finn|  'Cause Jake said Couples Night had weird kissing requirements and romance initiation rituals and whatever else.
Jake|  I didn't really say all that. 
Marceline|  Of course I'll go with you, Finn!
Finn|  You will?
Marceline|  Yeah, as friends.
Finn|  Of course as friends!
Marceline|  But no tongue.
Finn|  Yea—Wha?
Finn|  Oh, man! I can't believe I'm finally going to see this movie!
Woman in movie|  Oh, mon cher. I guess zese is goodbye.
Man in movie|  No, not goodbye. Let's say Farewell!
Finn|  Couples Night sucks! Marceline, would you do me the honor, of getting the plop out of here?
Marceline|  There's nothing I'd like more. 
Man in movie|  Nothing can ever tear us apart.
Finn & Jake|  
Finn|  It's slippin', dude.
Finn|  Phew.  Raini-corni-copia? An Unabridged History of the Rainicorns.  Whatever, man. I barely even made it through the title.
Jake|  Listen, man. One day, I'm probably gonna have half-rainbow pupsters. I gotta be able to share my babies' culture.
Jake|  
Finn|  Huh.  Oh.  Hey, this table is wobbly. We gotta take it to the Lost Tinker Goblin of Fog Mountain to fix it.
Jake|  Dude, I would love to go on some crazy, made-up adventure with you, but I really gotta read this. So from here on out, I'm just gonna ignore you. 
Finn|  I don't make up adventures! Jake, you know that! Jake! I don't make up adventures!  Hm.  Books, books.  Kitties, Zitties, Witties, Mitties, Knitties, Fitties, Hitties, Jitties, Pities, Cities...  Oh, no! Damaged books? Who did this?!
Turtle Princess|  Shhhhhhhushh!
Finn|  Sorry.  I will avenge thee, slightly-soiled books. Gotta tell Jake.
Finn|  Hello?  Is someone back here? Are you stuck?
Turtle Princess|  Shhhushmm!
Finn|   Hello?  Whoa! Ohhh! Hey, there's pages comin' outta these books!
People offscreen|  SHHHHHH!
Finn|  Who are you dudes?
Pagelings|  We are the Pagelings!
Paper Pete|  I am Paper Pete, the leader of the Pagelings. But you can call me P.P.
Finn|  I'll call you Pete.
Paper Pete|  Okay!
Finn|  Why are you dudes in the library?
Paper Pete|  We are the secret guardians of the books in the library. You know those blank pieces of paper in the beginning of old books?
Finn|  Yeah?
Paper Pete|  That's us! We revealed ourselves to you, noble giant, because you felt our plight when you saw the damaged books. And now is our darkest hour, for the Moldos have been growing more bold with every attack. Look at the damage done yesterday  at the Battle of Teddy Bear Joke Book.
Finn|  Wow, yeah.
Paper Pete|  They're massing for a full-scale assault on every book in the library!
Finn|  Gosh! Even the Rainicornicopia?
Paper Pete|  Yes.
Finn|  I better tell Jake. Don't you dudes go anywhere.
Pagelings|  Okay.
Finn|  Hey, bro, I've got an adventure—and it's not made up! There are these- these Pagelings they came out from- from books! And they- they folded into little animals.
Finn|  Do you hear what I'm saying?!
Jake|   Shhhh!
Finn|  You think I'm making this up?
Jake|   
Finn|  I'll prove it to you! 
Jake|  Finn!  Finn, you butt chicken!
Finn|  Jake, wait till you see 'em.
Finn|  Ow.
Jake|  
Finn|  They were just here! Pagelings?
Finn|  Why didn't you dudes introduce yourselves to Jake?
Paper Pete|  We don't want to reveal ourselves to anyone else. We are the secret guardians. Secret.
Finn|  Ummmm... yeah, but Jake is a powerful giant like me! He can help you battle or- or whatevs! But first, you must win his favor. Do you not want victory for your people?
Pagelings|  Yes! We do want victory!
Finn|  C'mon, follow me.  Jake, look.
Finn|   He's up here reading a book.
Finn|  Do something to get his attention.
Paper Pete|  Very well. We shall dance as flowers.
Other Pagelings|  Hoo-ah!
Finn|  Okay.
Pagelings|  
Finn|  Jake, the Pagelings are dancing for you. Just look up for a second!
Jake|  Finn, all the little voices you're doing are cute, but come on, man! Just let me read. 
Paper Pete|  By wearing the beast,  we shall become like the beast. 
Finn|  You can feel them, can't you?
Jake|  I can feel you pinching me.
Finn|  Just look up for a second!  Looooook.  Uhhh. Pagelings, I'm sorry, but my friend is acting like a clump.
Pagelings|  Okay.
Paper Pete|  We can't wait any longer. We must go back to the bookshelf to prepare for the Moldos' attack
Jake|  Yeah, go play make-believe somewhere else!
Finn|  I'm not making believe!
Paper Pete|   We were gone too long!
Paper Pete|  Wield, my brethren. Wield!
Pagelings|  
Finn|  
Moldo|  You win this battle, but next time, we will win.
Pagelings|  Yes, leave! Victory! Veni, vidi, vici!
Finn|  So, those little squishy guys are the Moldos?
Paper Pete|  Aye. This was but a reconnaissance squad... sent to test our mettle!
Pagelings|  Mettle!
Finn|  Uh-huh. They seem tough.
Paper Pete|  Their bites sting like the Dickens.
Finn|  Hmmm... their bites sting, eh? I've got a plan, Pete.
Paper Pete|  Tell me your plan, giant.
Finn|  Just trust me.  Trust me.
Paper Pete|  You've discovered the Moldos' Secret Lair!
Finn|  Eh, it wasn't very hard.
Finn|  Wibba-wibba-wah!
Moldo|  The Pagelings have a battle beast! Attack!
Moldos|  
Finn|  Whoa. Whoa, moldy blobs. I've come here to help the Moldos defeat the Pagelings.
Paper Pete|  Traitor!  Hiyah! Yah!
Finn|   Calm down, this is part of my plan.
Paper Pete|  Ohhh, ha-ha! Then I shall play along, wise giant. 
Moldo|  How are we to trust you?
Finn|  Well... here, look.  I brought you all a prisoner. It's their leader.
Paper Pete|  May you rot in Tartarus! May your skin boil and eyes burst into flames... forever in a pit! 
Finn|  
Paper Pete|  Traitor!
Finn|  So, do you guys have, like, a—like, a leader or somethin'?
Moldos|   Mildwin.
Paper Pete|  Mildwin.
Mildwin|  I'm Mildwin, leader of the Moldos.
Finn|  Oh, uhh... hmm.  Nice to meet you, your highness.
Mildwin|  I'm not a king; I was democratically elected.
Finn|   That's adorable.  Now, Finn! 
Moldo|  Protect the elected official!
Paper Pete|  Well played, ol' giant.  You have the cunning of Odysseus. 
Finn|  Pete, j-just stop winking.  Hyah!
People|  Shhhh!
Finn|  Ignore this! 
Jake|  Hmm?
Mildwin|  Mmm! This tastes delicious! 
Jake|  AAAAH! AAH!
Finn|  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Jake|  What did you do to me?! AAAAAAH!
Finn|  Ummm...
Jake|  AH! AAAH!
Finn|  Uhhh... come on, you guys, knock it off.
Moldo|  
Finn|  The Moldos got a taste for ya now.
Jake|  
Finn|"  Gotta do something. Where can I find ways to solve problems in a library?  ""Books""?  Books! Books! Books!"
Jake|  Aaah!
Finn|   Huh? Whatcha nibblin' me for?
Moldo|  This sweaty stuff tastes amazing. A-mazing!
Finn|  Hmmm. Tastier than battle beast fur. Yis! 
Finn|  Hey, Mildwin. Mildwin!
Mildwin|  What?
Finn|  I bring a peace offering from the Pagelings.
Mildwin|  Hmm?
Jake|  Finn... what's happening?
Finn|  Hang on, buddy. Paper Pete?
Paper Pete|  Giant! Have you wiped out the Moldo horde?
Finn|  Naw, man. The war's over.  Mildwin, you can keep my shirt if  you don't attack their library books.
Mildwin|  Agreed, beast. This filthy garb will feed my people for generations.
Finn|  And in forty years, you can have my shorts. Sound good, Pete?
Paper Pete|  It will suffice.
Finn|  Sound good, Jake?
Jake|   AAAH! What—What the hecks, man?! What'd you do to me?!
Finn|   Look, man! Moldos and Pagelings are real!
Jake|  Wha—? Who cares, man?! I'm outta here!
Finn|  Did you finish your Rainicorn book?
Jake|  Ugh... I was readin' the same paragraph over and over for, like, eleven minutes. I guess I'm gonna give up on learnin' everything about Rainicorn history. Don't tell Lady.
Finn|  Oh. What about relating to your mixed-species kids?
Jake|  Eh, I'll just fake it.
Finn|  Oh. Well... hey, man, I think I see some, um...  Sun People in trouble on the sun over there.
Jake|  You makin' that up?
Finn|  Mmhmm.
Jake|  Yeah! Let's do it! 
Finn|   WHOO! WHOOOO!
Princess Bubblegum| Cinnamon Bun, what the heck are you doing out in the woods?! I asked you twenty minutes ago to take these drinks around for us.
Cinnamon Bun|" Oh, oh, ""around for us."" I thought you said ""walk to the zoo and back""!"
Princess Bubblegum| Gob. 
Princess Bubblegum| Finn, Cinnamon Bun's gonna attend your juice bar now. I have a special job for you.
Princess Bubblegum| As Ooo's greatest champion, I'm relying on you to keep Lumpy Space Princess from crashing this wedding. I went ahead and deputized you.  So, you know, no holds barred, got it?
Finn|  Yeah. Oh, what about Jake?
Princess Bubblegum| Well, honestly I haven't seen Jake this happy in a while.
Princess Bubblegum| I kinda don't want squash his groove.
Princess Bubblegum| Knock, knock. Hey, Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks| Oh, hey, Princess. Wow, you look prettier than a sippy cup in a snowbank.
Princess Bubblegum|  Thanks, Tree Trunks. Now listen, I don't want you to worry about a thing. I've got Finn on LSP Deputy, and we're keeping your ex-husbands, Randy, Danny and Wyatt, a hundred feet apart at all times - at least until it's time for me to perform the ceremony.
Tree Trunks| Oh, well, uh, Princess, I appreciate your generosity going to all this trouble to hijack my wedding and all, but you can't perform the ceremony.
Princess Bubblegum| What?! Why not?
Tree Trunks|" Uh, well, I'm sorry, but I just don't recognize your quote unquote ""authority"" on such matters. I can only be married by His Holiness, the One True King of Ooo."
Princess Bubblegum| WHAT? That fraud?!
Tree Trunks| Now I know...
Princess Bubblegum| That fraud is here?!
Tree Trunks| Why, yes, but...
Tree Trunks| Oh, dear. Mama, I'm afraid I've offended the Princess.
Tree Trunks' mother| Oh, nonsense, baby. She's probably jealous 'cause you're about to marry a handsome, fine, saucy man. Oh, but he is a saucy, fine bologna factory. Mmmhmm, tell you what I'd like to open up that hood, see how the bologna gets made!
Tree Trunks| Mama, please! Please don't call him a saucy fine bologna factory!
Tree Trunks' mother| Bologna factory, bologna factory, bologna factory!
Tree Trunks| Oh, my perfect day. What else could go wrong?
King of Ooo| Please, go on. Describe the next thought form.
Mr. Pig's relative| Um... I see, like, reddish-green blotches.
King of Ooo| Ah... Ahaha!  One year good luck.
Princess Bubblegum| I've waited a long time for this King of Ooo, and now I'm gonna expose you in front of everyone for what you really are!
BMO| Yay! 
Wyatt| Hey, uh, barkeep, can I have another one of these ciders?
Cinnamon Bun| Sure! 
Wyatt| Hey, little robot. How ya doing?
BMO| I am the best! I love weddings, I love flowers! I love LOVE!
Wyatt| Hey, did you know I used to be married to Tree Trunks?
BMO| No!
Wyatt| Heh, yeah... it's just me and TT. We had some wild times back in the day. Did you know I once taught her to play tennis?
BMO| No...
Wyatt| Yep, tennis! I took her to one of those... uh... paddles... or whatever, you know!
BMO| No.
Wyatt| Yeah, she left me. She said I was stifling her spirit... I mean hehe... You know, what? Not enough tennis for ya?
BMO| No.
Mr. Pig's relative| It's starting! The ceremony is starting! 
BMO|  Oh no! I'm missing the love! 
Wyatt| No! Uh, please stay here! This is cathartic. You're a good listener.
BMO| Oh, okay... 
Mr Pig| Psst, Sweetie, you look so nice.
Tree Trunks| Shh...
Finn| Sounds really sweet.
Finn| Lumpy Space Princess? Is that you?
Lumpy Space Princess| Let me go to this party...
Finn| It's not your party, LSP. 
Lumpy Space Princess| Poor Finn. Don't you know?  Every party is my party.
Princess Bubblegum| I'm just gonna look in this guy's blimp.  Make sure everything's in accordance...  with the laws.
Mr. Pig| Psst... sweetie, what are ya doing?
Lumpy Space Princess| Get out of my way, Finn.  Oh my glob, you're touching my woman body!
King of Ooo| Okay, dear, now up you come.
Tree Trunks|  Don't hurry this. 
King of Ooo| There you go!
King of Ooo| Whoa, whoa, kids! Gotta finish the ceremony first. Keep the baby in the basket!
Lumpy Space Princess| Everyone at the party get ready! 'Cause here comes the hot bunch of grapes!
Lumpy Space Princess| Ahhhh... oh my gaaaah...
King of Ooo| We've gathered here on this beautiful day, under my life-giving sun, to celebrate the enjoinment of Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks, the little elephant. These two weird animals...
BMO| I bet some cute weddings are happening over there.
Wyatt|  BMO, you're so nice.
BMO| Those flowers look really cold.
Wyatt| I've had a hard life. People seem cute. They seem nice. And then when you can't stop crying because they beat you in tennis that one time, they call you a baby.
BMO| Yeah, cute nice babies.
Wyatt| BMO?
BMO| Mm-hmm?
Wyatt| BMO, would you move in with me?
King of Ooo| Do you, Mr Pig, take Tree Trunks to be your ever-wedded wife, forever following the teachings of me the true King of Ooo?
Mr. Pig| I do.
King of Ooo| Do you, Tree Trunks, do you promise to love Mr. Pig forever, and spend the next 5 years with me and my serenity compound, performing simple household repairs,  to have and to hold the in sickness and in health, in my gated mountain compound?
Tree Trunks| I...
Lumpy Space Princess| Everybody get ready...  to pay attention to me...
Tree Trunks| I...
Tree Trunks| do... oh 
Lumpy Space Princess| Everybody, hey! I'm here! Look at my bouq- 
Cinnamon Bun| Ah... 
King of Ooo| My zep!
Princess Bubblegum| Everybody! This wedding is a farce! A criminal farce!
King of Ooo| Hey, just what are you egging at here?
Princess Bubblegum| I'll tell you what I'm egging at! I'm egging at this outdated wedding officiant license!
King of Ooo| Oh, is that what this is about? You must've found that in my back records! I have the up-to-date paperwork right here!
Tree Trunks| Oh!
Princess Bubblegum| What? Uh...
King of Ooo| Hey, wait, how did you get that? I could've swore it was locked in my zep.
Princess Bubblegum| No... shhh... no... nope nope, stop talking, go to jail!  Yeah!
Tree Trunks| Princess Bubblegum, you have gone too far. We stand together against your tyranny.
Finn| Hey, everybody.
Tree Trunks| Your prison may hold one of us, but it may not hold all of us.
Tree Trunks| Oh, poor Tree Trunks. Wait, where's my mama? Has anyone seen my... oh!
Tree Trunks| No, Mama. Well I guess this is it, sweetie.  Oh, oh no, the elephant graveyard is calling me now. Okay, hold your horses, I'm coming!
Mr Pig| Wait, Tree Trunks. Look around everyone we care about is all here together. Finn, Uncle Donald, Banana Guard Number 1, Jake, Jake Junior, everybody. We can have the ceremony right here.
Tree Trunks| Hey yeah! King of Ooo, will you do the honors?
King of Ooo| Are you crazy? That loopy bird is gonna string me up sideways. You can perform your own dang ceremony. Kingofooo.com! 
Tree Trunks| Oh, dear.
Mr Pig| Oh, my gosh. Tree Trunks, did you hear?
Tree Trunks| Huh?
Mr Pig| The King said you can perform your own dang ceremony!
Tree Trunks| Yeah, that really stunk.
Mr Pig| But...
Tree Trunks| But... the King's word is law. I can perform my own dang ceremony?
Jake| Are you up to it, TT?
Tree Trunks| I'll try. I guess it's time. A-are you ready?
Tree Trunks| Oh. Okay, um... do you Mr Pig take me, Tree Trunks, to be your beautiful wedded wife?
Mr Pig| I do.
Tree Trunks| And do I, Mr Pig, take him to be your lawful wedded husband, Tree Trunks?
Mr Pig| I do.
Tree Trunks| Then you... you may kiss the bride!
Princess Bubblegum| Aww, geez, let them all go, Banana Guard Number 3.
Banana Guard Number 3| Uh... what?
Princess Bubblegum| I just can't stay mad at something so cute.
Banana Guard| Did she just say let everyone go?
Tree Trunks| Looks like we got the whole place to ourselves... if you know what I'm saying.
Mr Pig| Wait, d-don't you think there might be cameras down here?
Tree Trunks| I hope so...
Finn|   Baby!
Jake|  Ooo!
Finn|   I know what you need.
Jake|  What's that?
Finn|   You want your little baby socks, for your little baby feet.
Jake|  Woo!
Finn|   Baby!
Jake|  Yeah?
Finn|   I know what you crave.
Jake|  Oh, yeah? What's that?
Finn|   You want to poop your pants all day long. Well, baby behave!
Jake|  Hey, how can you sing like that, dude?
Finn|  Remember when I swallowed that little computer?
Jake|  Oh, yeah.
Finn|  Alright, Stanley. You and your family are safe... Again...
Jake|  Seriously, Stanley. For a watermelon you get into trouble way more often than you should.
Jake|  W-whoa!
Finn|  What the... Shmow-zow! Look at that!
Jake|  That... is the most adorable thing I have ever seen. And he loves your baby song. Sing some more of it, dude.
Finn|  Alright.  Baby! You lookin' so good. You lookin' like you might... want some baby food.
Jake|  Keep it going, man! 
Finn|   Baby! You lookin' so fine. You lookin' like you might... just start cryin'.
Jake|   Yeah!
Finn|  Dude! This guy... is a pal for life! It looks like he's got two jiggly bellies stuck together.
Jake|  I've got that on my back. I call it my butt.
Jake|  Whoa!
Finn|   He's the Jiggler.
Finn|   You are the best thing ever. Let's take the Jiggler back to the house and just stick him by our bed so we can wake up...
Finn & Jake|  Next to a little dancing guy every morning!
Finn|   I gotta tuck you in, girl. I gotta sing you sweet melodies about babies. Yeah!
Jake|  Little baby feet!
Finn|   Welcome to your new home. Feast your eyes on... everything!
Jiggler|  
Jake|  What are you doing?
Finn|  Splitting my toothbrush in half, so he can use half.
Finn|   Here you go. It's for your teeth.
Finn|   Like this.
Finn|  Yeah! You got it.
Jake|  Enough hygiene.  Let's get to it!
Finn|  Yeah! Toothbrush dance.  This is cool!
Finn|   Yeah!
Finn|   Dance... dance...  dance...  I'm not tired! How about you, Jake?
Finn|   Maybe we should go upstairs.
Finn|   You can have the comfiest spot on the bed. Goodnight. 
Jiggler|  
Finn|  Mornin', Jake!
Jake|   Mornin'.
Finn|  Are you ready to get down?  Let's get this party started!
Jake|   Yeah, ok.
Finn|  Where's the little guy?
Jake|   Over there.
Finn|  Hey, pal. You ready to cut loose? Wake and shake, buddy. Let's do this thing! 
Jiggler|  
Jake|  Slam-a-cow! That fool looks rumped.
Finn|  What do you mean?
Jake|  Well, look at him. He's all limp... and weird.
Finn|  Aww... I bet he just needs some breakfast after a night of extraordinary jiggling. Hey! Let's combine everything we can find in the kitchen... and have the Jiggler drink it! That'll wake him up! And then we can... Get  doooowwwn!
Jiggler|  
Jake|  He doesn't want to drink that goop, man.
Finn|  Then let's just give him some, uh... purple whatevers.
Jake|  You mean the grapes?
Finn|  Yeah. Whatever.
Finn|  Hey! I think he's diggin' it!
Jake|  That doesn't sound good.
Finn & Jake|  
Finn|  Uhh...
Jake|   Uh, you think we... think we fed the wrong hole?
Finn|  Nah. He just doesn't like purple whatevers. What we need to do is figure out what he likes to eat.
Finn|   Here, Jiggler. What kind of food do you like? Meat? Some banana? This looks like corn... I think. Uh... hot dog. Stanley the watermelon.
Finn|   Look! Jake! He likes it!
Finn|   Wow!
Jake|  No way!
Finn|  His favorite food... is drawings! Awesome!
Jake|  Holy fig, that's awesome! What food are you drawing now?
Finn|  I'm drawing a picture of you.
Jake|   Well, don't feed it me!
Finn|   Come on. Eat him up, Jiggler!
Jake|  No!
Jake|   Ahhh! Keep it away! Shoo! Shoo! 
Finn|   Alright. Alright. I got it. Calm down... I'll eat it.  Ahhhhh.
Jake|   Dude! You eating me is just as bad as the Jiggler eating me.
Finn|  Well... You gonna eat yourself, tough guy?
Jake|  Yes. If that is what must be done.
Jake|  I taste awesome.
Finn & Jake|  
Finn|  Ok. Alright. Now, let's get back to some jiggling!
Jake|  I'll get the tunes!
Finn|  Like this. Yeah! Woo! Come on Jiggler! wiggle and whistle!
Jake|  Yeah, Jiggler. Go nuts! Go nuts like there's bugs on your butts!
Jake|  Whoa!
Finn|   Jiggler?
Jake|  What the heck? What's wrong with him?
Finn|  Uh... There's nothing wrong with him. We just gotta plug up his holes.
Finn|  See? That worked. Ready to jiggle again, little guy?
Finn|  Whoa!
Jake|  Oh, man...
Finn|   Quick! We gotta plug those holes!
Finn|  Jake, hurry!
Jake|  All I could find was your glass eye collection!
Finn|  What about your eyepatch collection?
Jake|  Aw, man. They're in mint condition.
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|   Alright! Coming!
Jake|  One... more... patch!  Finished. Ugh. He looks terrible. Finn, I know you don't want to hear this, but I think we should cut our losses and bring this fella back to where we found him.
Finn|  We can't just abandon him. Look at him, Jake. He needs us now more than ever.  Just need to take better care of you from now on, right little guy?
Finn|  Jiggler!
Jake|  Oh... Finn. Ok... Our pet exploded.
Finn|  
Jake|  Maybe we can... scrape him up! And... eyuhh...
Finn|   Oh, holy moly! Don't worry, Jiggler. We'll fix you. 
Finn|  Let's gather him up, Jake. He's all over the place... even between the floorboards!
Jake|  And the cupboards!
Finn|  And the galoshes!
Jake|  I wonder... Where's his heinie?
Jake|  Found it! Come here, you!
Jake|  Hey!
Finn|  Come on. Let's put him back together.
Jake|  Ok.
Finn|  Squeeze real hard. He's slipping!
Jake|  Got him!
Jake|  Well, at least he's all in one piece.
Jake|  Sheesh. You think he's dead?
Finn|  No way! I won't let you die, guy! Not this time.
Jake|  Finn. Stop it, man. What are you doing?
Finn|  I'm kissing him! What do you think? It's all I could think to do.
Jake|  Just put him down.
Finn|  He's kissing colors with his dying breath.
Jake|  I think he's trying to tell us something. Finn, this looks like it could be his Mama Jiggler
Finn|  We took this child away from its mama, Jake. We're kidnappers and murderers! I just wanted to have fun and jiggle!
Jake|  Look... Chill out, ok? We can fix this. Check it out.  His mom looks like she's out by Stanley's house... where we found the Jiggler. If we get him back to her, she'll be able to fix him up!
Finn|   Then there's no time to spare.
Finn|   Shhh. Just hold on a little longer, buddy.
Jake|  Did you hear that? Whistling!
Finn|  Perpendicular! It's the mama!
Jake|  Look! The little guy wants to go home!
Finn|   Well. This is it, buddy.
Jake|   Be well.
Finn|   Hey! Stop that!
Finn|  I don't understand. That crazy mama almost killed him.
Jake|  He feels cold.
Finn|  What are we supposed to do now, man? We can't bring him home, or he'll... or he'll...
Finn|  Dang it! Why doesn't she love him? I love him!  You love him! It's not fair!  Ahhhh!
Jake|  Finn, wait!
Finn|  Mama's supposed to love baby! She's supposed to love baby!
Jake|  Huh?
Jake|   Oh, man!
Finn|  It's yours, idiot!
Finn|  Don't you recognize your own baby?
Jake|   Finn! I figured it out, dude. It's the juice. The Jiggler needs to smell like its mama's juice. That's how wild animals know what’s going on... and this guy right here is all drained out. We gotta toss it in the soup, brother.
Finn|  Alright. Ok.  I loved you, baby. I hope you know that.
Finn|   Word to your motheeeerrrrr!
Finn & Jake|  Awww...
Finn|  I'll never kidnap again.
Jake|  You said it! That was a nightmare.
Bella Noche| Have you obtained the staff of Stranson Doughblow?
Forest Wizard| Yes, Bella Noche. We procured the staff using the full extent of our wizardy ways.
Bella Noche| Then the time has come to reveal my true form, and when I materialize on this... 
Ice King|  Oh, this striz is going down, man.
Bella Noche| ...you will receive your end of the deal.
Laser Wizard| The lost system of Antediluvian magick—the tightest of all wiz biz.
Forest Wizard| So right and tight, I get restless leg syndrome about it. Look. 
Bella Noche| And now, it will be yours.
Ice King| And mine!
Forest Wizard| What the blood?! Ice King!
Ice King| Listen, dudes, all I want is to be in the club and plus up my magic. What's the problem?
Laser Wizard| Your life is my problem.
Bella Noche| Too late, fools! Bella Noche emerges!
Forest Wizard| Whoa! What the—?
Grand Master Wizard| Stop that now, trash cones! Bella Noche must not cross into our world!
Ice King| Eh, why not, again?
Grand Master Wizard| Duck!
Grand Master Wizard| Aw, cram! Here we go!
Forest Wizard|  Uhhhh... hey. Hey, I—I can't feel my magic!
Laser Wizard| Me neither. What gives?
Grand Master Wizard| Bella Noche is a being of pure anti-magic! Y'alls got played!
Simon| Uh, hello?
Forest Wizard| Oh, what a fool am I!  Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Grand Master Wizard|  Go! Destroy! Throw your boots at it, or—I don't know!
Simon| Huh? 
Grand Master Wizard| Dang. Sorry, Ice King.
Simon|   This must be it, man.  I've crossed into some super-insane zone where I feel like I'm just normal again.  Or maybe I'm just normal again.
Ash| Hey, stop looking at yourself. You're ugly, bro. Get lost. This is my busking spot.
Simon|"  Sorry, man. No time! Go, carpet!  Whoa!  It's got to be here. Even in my prolonged state of insanity, my immutable essence must have known to—oh, yes.  Hello.  Ah, my research. My jackie—jacket!  Mutation, mutation, mind expa—aha!  ""Mystic Rituals And Their Space Time Applications"" by Simon Petrikov and Betty Grof.  Betty.  Whoops. Marceline?"
Marceline| A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four.
Finn| Wait!
Marceline| What?
Finn| Why are you holding your bass up high like that?
Marceline| Mm-mm-mmm.  I get better finger action this way.
Finn| But you look like a nerd. Move it back down. It's better.
Jake| Move the bass down.
Finn| A-move the bass a-down.
Jake| Be reasonable.
Marceline|  Yes?
Simon| Marcy, it's me, Simon. I'm back, but my body might donk out soon, so get to the Ice Kingdom fast and help me with this time portal so I can find Betty and say I'm sorry before I croakboat! I know that's a lot to process, but hurry, and bring Hambo. Hambo is the key.
Simon| Okay, Marcy? You got that? Marcy?
Marceline| A long, long time ago, Simon was my only friend. He was there when I needed help.
Marceline|  All he ever wanted was to find Betty, and now I can help him.
Marceline| Simon?
Gunter| Wenk!  Wenk!
Marceline| Simon!
Simon| Marceline!
Marceline| I thought I'd never see you again.
Simon| I can hardly believe it myself. You're all grown up.
Jake| Believe! She's like a million years old!
Simon| One million years? How could it be?!
Marceline| He's just kidding. I'm only a thousand.
Jake| And still looking good!
Finn| Do you remember anything from when you were the Ice King?
Simon| Nothing specific—just dreamlike impressions.
Finn| Do you still have impressions from all the times we flipped your bricks?
Simon| I have... bruises.  Excuse me. I—
Marceline| Man, Simon.
Simon| I'm fine. 
Marceline| You're dying!
Simon| Well, yes, but only in increments. I've still got work to do. Finn and Jake, will you run my generator?
Finn| Yeah, man.
Jake| Cool.
Simon| That's great! Keep pedaling! All we need now is the catalyst—an object from the past that has been lovingly tended to through the ages.
Marceline|  Goodbye, Hambo. 
Simon| Because of you, I can say goodbye to Betty and tell her I'm sorry for driving her away. Thank you, Marceline. 
Simon|  Where's my Betty? Where's my princess?! Princess! Princess!!
Betty| Simon, don't leave me like this.
Simon| Betty? Betty. Betty!
Betty| Simon? What is going on?
Simon| I'm a thousand years in the future, love. I opened this portal so we could say goodbye.
Betty| You're dumping me?
Simon| No! It's just that everything changed after I put on that crown. I—I went crazy. You ran away. I—I never saw you again.
Betty| But where would I go without you?
Simon| I'll never know.
Betty| I don't understand. You don't seem crazy now. I mean, in the future.
Simon| The portal is closing. There's no time to explain. Just know that I love you, and I forgive you for leaving me.
Betty| Simon, I know who I'm leaving you for!
Simon| Who?
Betty|  You, dum-dum! 
Betty| Simon?  What's wrong? Are you sick?
Simon| No, I'm old. The crown was keeping me alive, but its magic was negated by the creature Bella Noche.
Betty| Don't die, Simon. I just got here.
Simon| Oh, I'm sorry, Betty.
Betty| I know! I'll fix the crown, and then I'll figure out how to fix you!
Simon| What? No. Guys, stop her.
Jake| Uh...
Marceline| Hmm...
Finn| Yeah, but...
Jake| It kind of sounds like a good idea.
Betty| Right, whoever you are.  I'm sorry. It's the only way. 
Simon| No!
Betty|  Okay, rug, take me to Bella Noche.
Betty| Get on, Simon!
Simon| I am getting on... the death bus.
Death|  I've got you in my sights, Simon. 
Simon| It's my time, Betty! I don't want to be the Ice King again. It's like living with eternal diaper butt. I can't do it!
Betty| Not forever. Destroying Bella Noche and getting your power back will buy me time to find a loophole that'll undo your curse and your death. I can do it! You got to believe me, Simon.
Simon| I...
Death|" Get real, man. You're gonna be the Ice King till the sun blows up. This is your one chance. I made a mix tape for the ride ""Summer Jams 3""!"
Simon| If I don't let her try, then what am I? What am us?
Betty| What?
Death| Eh, fair enough. See you in a few. 
Grand Master Wizard| This brioche won't stop growing.  Ron James, what took...  you?
Ron James| Yo, my lab got creamed! I had to dummy-rig an alchemical filter out of a dirty bidet and a vaporizer!
Grand Master Wizard| But will the double-negative magic work?
Ron James| Heck yeah! Ron James always delivers! Check it out, brotha! Yaah!  In your face!
Grand Master Wizard & Ron James| Yeah!
Grand Master Wizard| What the stink is that?!
Ron James| My lab conditions were not ideal.
Grand Master Wizard| But you did not deliver! 
Ron James| Peace, man! Aaah!
Betty| We're here to help!
Grand Master Wizard| Help how?
Grand Master Wizard| We're toast, bro.
Simon|  
Betty| Simon!
Betty| Hey, don't scare me like that.
Simon| Just hold my hand to your face. This will be my... last sensation.
Betty| Don't be a wimp, Simon! Just give me a second! 
Death| You got about 15 seconds.
Bella Noche| How the—? Wait.
Betty| Surprise!  Tranch.
Death| You lose, Simon. Sorry, man. 
Ice King| Uh, huh?
Ice King| This a party? Huh?
Grand Master Wizard| Wizard City is saved!  
Ice King| Whoa! Heh. Okay. Whoopee!
Ice King| So then, Ron James told me this girl I was with flew into Bella Noche and mysteriously defeated it for me! Wow! 
Ice King| Just my luck, right? Black out for a day and meet the woman of your dreams.
Muscle Princess| I will get you!
Ice King| Hey, don't be jealous, Muscle Princess. She's gone—kablooey. Let's be realistic, right? We both know you're not my top pick.
Ice King| Oh, Grod!
Ice King| No!
Ice King| Aaah! Go home! You can go! Aah!
Flame Person|  Brrrr. It's freezing in here.  Whoa, I'm losing a lot of weight! Calorie control and moderate exercise are the key. But I don't do any of those things, so this is weird. Hmm...
Flame Guard|  My jets are tiny!  No one look at my tiny jets!
Flame Person| At least your body is normal, man. My body isn't hot anymore!
Flame Person| What's going on, man? I'm scared!
Flame Person| Give me a hug, man! I don't know!  Aaaaaah! Nooooo! My baby brooooo!
Flame Princess|  It's as I feared. The magma in the kingdom's core is cooling down, weakening the life force of our Flame Citizens. I've gathered you here to figure out how to stop this. We need ideas, people! 
Randy| I'll do my best, sis!
Flame Princess| Randy, you are here to stay safe only. Eat your snacks.
Randy| I'll do my best, sis. 
Agnes| Perhaps everyone can form into a big love hug to stay warm!
Flame Princess| That's ridiculous, aunt Agnes.
Agnes| I'm not that smart.
Flame Princess' older brother|  Blow up the Candy Kingdom! I've been saying this for months now! And I'll say it again! Let's blow 'em up with their stockpile of you know whats! We've debated this too long!
Agnes| But why the Candy Kingdom?
Flame Princess' older brother| Their sugar burns hotter and faster with lots of extra calories. Don't make me wait, sister! Also, is it safe to talk about in front of the C-I-N-N-A-M-O-N B-U-N?
Flame Princess| Cinnamon Bun, what are you doing?
Cinnamon Bun| My nose itches!
Flame Princess| You don't have a nose.
Cinnamon Bun| What? 
Flame Princess| Well, whatever it is, it won't go away if you don't stop fiddling with it.
Flame Princess' older brother|  Blow up the Candy Kingdom! They are trash people!
Flame Princess| I'm prepared to do what I need to as a leader. Nothing is off the table, but we need Princess Bubblegum as an ally right now. She might be able to help us solve this.
Flame Princess' older brother| Very well. Randy, send them an ultimatum! Help us or die! 
Randy| Randy is on it! 
Cinnamon Bun| Princess! 
Flame Princess' older brother|  Yeah, pump those legs, Randy!
Flame Princess| Quickly, CB, take me to the core entrance.
Cinnamon Bun| Okay!
Flame Princess| Hello, Bubblegum. Thank you for coming.
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm glad you sent for me, and please, call me Bonnibel! Hey, what's your first—?
Flame Princess| Don't act like you're my friend, PB! You're here to help save my kingdom, not because I trust you.
Flame Princess| We're in the midst of unnatural cold season, but the cause has us stumped.  My people are really freaking out.
Princess Bubblegum| Yeah, my subjects tend to panic in crisis situations, too.  It's tough; a ruler's got to deal with a lot of subservient dummies.
Flame Princess| Hmmm...
Princess Bubblegum| Whoa! Whoa! Hold up. My Mondometer is going cuckoo.  Where does this lead?
Flame Princess| Behind these doors are the most secret relics in the Fire Kingdom. Forbidden to outsiders. Come on.
Princess Bubblegum| Well, whatever is back there is kicking out mondo energy levels. It could have something to do with the cooling.
Princess Bubblegum| Do you wanna save your kingdom or not?
Flame Princess| Alright, but don't touch anything!  These are the sleeping Fire Giants. They're the ancient protectors of the Fire Kingdom. Their existence is known only to those of the royal line, and their story has been passed down through the generations.
Flame Princess|"  With them, I can remake a white-hot new Fire Kingdom. They are our last resort, our greatest weapons. Huh?  Hey! I said ""no touching""!"
Princess Bubblegum| What? Oh, no no no! This little geothermic control module, or whatever it is, accidentally fell out.  I was just putting it back!
Flame Princess| Huh, strange. The access panel's lock must have corroded.
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeah, ancient technology's always falling apart.  Oh! The readings are over here now! 
Flame Princess| What?!
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, let me explain. These bad boys are just too dangerous to remain functional, and I can't risk you or your bananas brother using them, especially now that you've lost most of your powers.  So let me just finish disarming...
Flame Princess|  You are way out of line, Bubblegum! You have no control here!  I do! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Aah! Shield, shield! 
Flame Princess| Nooooo!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey, nice shot! Ya ding dong!
Princess Bubblegum| Cloak. 
Flame Princess| Come out in the open and face me like a princess!
Princess Bubblegum|  The Fire Kingdom has always been a threat to my realm! 
Flame Princess| So that gives you the right  to donk up my people's future?!  I won't let you continue to usurp my authority!
Princess Bubblegum| And I can't leave my people's safety to chance! 
Flame Princess|  Why can't you just trust me?! 
Princess Bubblegum|  'Cause you're a ding dong. I've got to do whatever it takes to protect my peeps. 
Flame Princess| So be it. 
Flame Princess|  You're never going to change, are you? You'll just keep walking all over us little people!  But not today.
Princess Bubblegum|  Shields off.  Okay, I'll come clean.
Flame Princess| Yeah, right.
Princess Bubblegum| It was me. I messed with the core temperature to get in here. I had to get near your weapon stockpile.
Flame Princess| But how did you find out about them?
Princess Bubblegum| Ummm...
Cinnamon Bun| Wait...  Wow, my nose is disgusting!
Flame Princess| You're still spying on me?
Princess Bubblegum| I'm PB! I spy on everybody. No big D!
Flame Princess| You're cold, PB!
Princess Bubblegum| Eh. 
Flame Princess| And it's not because you're a scientist or leader; it's because you are a bad person! Something inside you is messed up, girl. And whatever it is,  whatever, whatever, PB!
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, keep one last fire giant. I'm not a bad person. I want you to see that. I promise.
Flame Princess| You better not be fibbing.  It's Phoebe. My first name is Phoebe. You, uh, asked earlier.
Princess Bubblegum| Ice King, call it off.
Ice King| Roger that, Princess. 
Flame Guard| My jets! Yes!
Flame Person|  Oh no!
Flame Princess' older brother| I was gonna blow up stuff! It was going to be cool!
Princess Bubblegum| Hmmm... 
Flame Princess' older brother| We were going to war! 
Phlannel Boxingday| Psst. Lemonhope.
Phlannel Boxingday| Hey. That's better.
Lemonhope| Who are you?
Phlannel Boxingday| My name's Phlannel Boxingday, and I've been watching you and your hard, hot life in this desert from up there  in my cloud trawler. I thought you might need a hand.
Lemonhope| Mm-hmm.
Phlannel Boxingday| Kid, truth be told, you're looking a little raw. You're totally free to come hang out with me until you're feeling stronger.
Lemonhope|  Mm...
Phlannel Boxingday| It's your choice.
Phlannel Boxingday|  Ha-ha, let's go, dude.
Phlannel Boxingday| So... read any good books lately?
Lemonhope| Oh, I can't read. They tried to teach me in school, but... mm, I just faked it.
Phlannel Boxingday| Ah-hah... Uh-oh. Hold that thought, buddy. Looks like a Greed Lard's picked up our scent. Dangit, he's a fast one. We can't outrun him, but maybe we can drive him off. I need you to play that flute of yours, Lemonhope. I saw how you rassled those scorpions before. Now play that flute with all your might!
Phlannel Boxingday| Keep it up, Lemonhope. It's working! He's turning off!
Phlannel Boxingday| No, wait. He—he's mad. We've enraged him. He's calling his pack. The harp, Lemonhope! Quick, quick, quick!
Phlannel Boxingday| We'll lure the beast into the rocks.
Lemonhope| No! Phlannel! Stop the ship! Stop the ship!
Phlannel Boxingday| What? What for?
Lemonhope| STOP THE SHIP!
Phlannel Boxingday| You see, Lemonhope? It's not peeps. It's dosh!
Lemonhope| Oh.
Phlannel Boxingday| Greed Lards eat dosh for food, and 'cause we killed it, we get to keep it all. That's my job, Lemonhope. When I'm not out being free and having adventures, I'm killing monsters that eat dosh and then keeping the dosh. And it just so happens that I'm looking for a new apprentice. What do you think about partnering up with old Phlannel Boxingday?
Lemonhope| Oh, my gosh, Phlannel, yes!  It's a dream come true!  A dream come true! A dream come true...
Lemonhope| ♪Poor little Lemonhope.  Throw me a lemon-rope. Is there a home for me and my harp? A place where my  friends... give me hu—?
Cow| Hey. Hey... What's going on back there? Somethin' don't feel right. Oh, hey! Lemonhope is here! Hey, man, how's it goin—?
Cow| Whoa, what the heck?
Cow| Run for it, Lemonhope! Run, run! C'mon! Why aren't you running?
Phlannel Boxingday| Morning, Lemonhope! Hey, is there any more white coal down in the hold?  More black diamonds equals more love potions. The old three Rs, y'know what I'm saying? Ro-ro-romance. No, man, I can't wait for some love. It's been so lo—  whoops. Oh, drats. Oh, well. Hey, don't sweat it, buddy. It wasn't your fault.
Lemonhope| It's not that, Phlannel. I had a bad dream.
Phlannel Boxingday| Again? That's the third time this week.
Lemonhope|  I'm free now, Phlannel, to do all whatevs I ever wanted, but all I think about is my old life. What does it mean?
Phlannel Boxingday| Well, it's true you are free—free to help the Lemon People or leave them be—but a debt unpaid is not easily forgotten. So you are a prisoner still in deinem kopf.
Lemonhope| Huh. That's what Mistress always said, and I didn't even listen.
Phlannel Boxingday| Ah, Lemonhope, you're a doer, not a listener. You learn with your heart and hands, not your head. So... what will you do, Lemonhope?
Lemonhope| I'll... I'll go back, and I'll help my people, and maybe I'll feel better.
Phlannel Boxingday|  And how will you do it?
Lemonhope| Um... with my harp  and... my flute!  And help from my friend Phlannel!
Phlannel Boxingday| Nah, little Lemonhope. Of course, I'll take you as far as I can, but I can't interfere directly in Lemongrab politics. All those old pacts and treaties have me sklonked up tighter than a synthetic zanoit sterilizer bed compressor tube enlarger on garbage day.
Lemonhope| ♪Lemonhope's family held in Lemongrab's lair. Saving them will save me, but... I am pretty scared.♪
Lemonhope| Hmm... 
Lemongrab| Looking for something?
Lemongrab| Well, you found me, fat Lemongrab.
Lemongrab| Oh, what's that you've got? Ah-ha, your little harp? But what's this?  I've got things in my ears tonight! So now I'm invincible!
Lemongrab 2|  Play it, Lemonhope!
Lemongrab| What? I—speak up, child!
Lemonhope| I didn't say anything.
Lemongrab 2| The harp! Hurry! I'll take care of the rest!
Lemongrab| What?
Lemongrab 2| The harp, Lemonhope! Play it!
Lemongrab| Oh, the harp! Didn't I just explain? I've got things in my—
Lemongrab|  My—my—my things! 
Lemongrab|  Let—Let me go! Let me go!
Lemongrab 2| The harp, Lemonhope! The harp!
Lemongrab|  This sounds awful!
Lemongrab 2| Faster, Lemonhope!
Lemongrab 2| Faster, Lemonhope!
Lemongrab| I can't stands no more!
Lemongrab 2| Faster!
Lemongrab|  AAAAAAAAAAAAAH—!
Lemonhope| Hmm?
Lemonhope| Coming! 
Lemonhope| Wait, I'm—I'm—I'm coming!
Lemonhope| Hello? H—Hello?
Princess Bubblegum| You know, I was thinking, Lemonhope. Maybe you'd like to stay here in Lemongrab while Lemongrab recovers. Every kingdom needs a champion, and you're a true champion if ever I've seen one. Plus, I already set up a little room for you.
Lemonhope| Is he gonna stay like that?
Princess Bubblegum| Like what?  Oh, heh, no, no-no-no-no. Once his brains and bodies remix, he should be back to his lonely old self, which seems to be his only stable relationship model.
Lemongrab 3| Me!
Princess Bubblegum| So will you stay, Lemonhope, and help your people once more?
Lemonhope| Nah, that's okay.
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, but I thought...
Lemonhope| I mean, you guys are cool and all, but I mostly came back here so I could stop thinking about y'all all the time. I'll be back when I'm tired of being free.  See you in a thousand years, I guess. Peace!
Finn| Wow. I really thought he was gonna stay.
Princess Bubblegum| Me too. I even wrote a song about it.
Princess Bubblegum| Hey! Don't laugh.
Finn| Let me hear it!
Princess Bubblegum| No! It's terrible.
Finn| Come on!
Princess Bubblegum| No!
Finn| Come on! Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it...
Princess Bubblegum| Gah! Okay, okay.
Marceline|  Thanks for helping me record, Finn.
Finn|  No problem, Marceline.
Marceline|  Now, I'm gonna sing something really personal, so don't laugh at me.
Finn|  I would never dream of it... m'lady. 
Marceline|  Now, start a slow beat, and keep it steady, or it'll mess up everything.
Finn|  You got it!
Marceline|  Huh? Finn, you messed the beat up!
Finn|  Marceline, if you're thinkin' about your dad so much, then... why don't you go see 'im?
Marceline|   He's not worth the effort.
Finn|  Not worth what effort?
Marceline|  Well... first, I'd have to draw a circle with a happy face in the center and then... uh... douse it with bug milk.
Finn|   Oh, yeah?! 
Marceline|"   And then you're supposed to chant something like , ""Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum.""  But... I-I don't really wanna see him. I'm still mad about the thing with the fries.  Huh?!"
Finn|  Wwwwhhhat?!  Whoa... whoa!! Aaagh!!
Lord of Evil|  Marceline!
Marceline|  Finn... what the heck did you do?!
Finn|  I... reunited you with your family?
Lord of Evil|  Is this kid your evil servant?
Finn|  I'm not evil, Marceline's dad. I'm super good!
Lord of Evil|"  ""Super good?"" "
Finn|   What're you doing?!
Lord of Evil|  Stealing your soul.
Marceline|  Dad!  Ugh! You always do stuff like this!
Lord of Evil|  Haha! Oh, Marceline! I never know what's gonna set you off! Whoa! Is this the family ax?
Marceline|  Wha—? HEY!!!
Lord of Evil|  Did you turn it into some kind of lute?
Marceline|   Give it back, and get out!!!
Lord of Evil|  Okay, I'll go. I've got business to attend to, anyway—sucking up all the souls in Oooooo...
Finn|   WHA—Gh—NO!!
Lord of Evil|  See you kids later! 
Marceline|  My bass!
Finn|  I've unleashed evil onto Ooo ! We've gotta stop 'im, Marceline!
Marceline|  Fine... but I'm only coming with you to get my bass back.
Finn|  Hey! How do I kill this guy, anyway?
Marceline|  Finn! You can't kill my dad!
Finn|  Oh! I'm sorry! I didn't mean—
Marceline|  No! You literally can't kill my dad! He's deathless!
Finn|  Oh...
Fluffy Person|   Huh?  Who the fluff are you?
Lord of Evil|  Um... Well, I'm sure not the guy who's gonna suck out your soul.
Fluffy Person|  Good 'cause that's, like, my number one fear.
Lord of Evil|  Really!? Well... I know a little exercise for that! Wanna try??
Fluffy Person|  Wow...
Lord of Evil|  First... close your eyes.
Fluffy Person|  Okay!  AAH! You coulda killed me!
Lord of Evil|  Ah, but I didn't! And now, aren't you thrilled just to be alive?
Fluffy Person|  Yeah, I guess... So what?
Lord of Evil|  So... This next part will be all the more... horrifying. 
Finn|  There!! Below us! A gathering of Fluffy People! May-haps they've seen your father! Marceline... release the Finn-bomb!  They're all freaked out!
Marceline|  It's because they're scared of him.  Hm. My dad's been here. Come on. Let's go.
Finn|  No! We gotta help this guy. I've got some soul food that Jake packed for me. You like, uh, collard greens or country-fried steak?
Marceline|  Look. You wanna help him? Help me get my bass back.
Finn|  How will that help hi—?
Marceline|  MY DAD STOLE MY BASS GUITAR, FINN!! And when I get it back... I'm gonna break it over his neck and slam my dad back into the Nightosphere!
Finn|  Oh, clam! But first you gotta return the souls your dad sucked back to these sad, little husks. Right, Marceline?
Marceline|   Uh, sure, yeah, yeah, we'll do that.
Head Marauder|"  So I popped his head like a cork! And I says, ""That's what I think of Expanding Earth Theory!"""
Lord of Evil|  Alright.
Marauders|  Huh?!
Lord of Evil|  I've got a joke, too.  What wears a dark suit, is completely evil, and is about to suck out all your souls?
Head Marauder|  Yo mama!
Lord of Evil|   That's right! I'm your mama! 
Marceline|  Red Rock Pass. If my dad wants to get through the mountains, he'll have to come through here.
Finn|  We can work together! And smash 'im with this rock! And once he's smooshed, all the souls will go back to their rightful bods.
Lord of Evil|  So, finally taking a run at your old man, huh?
Marceline|   Daddy...
Lord of Evil|   Karate kick!! 
Finn|  Marceline!! Keep 'im right there!! HrrrrRAAAAGH!!!
Lord of Evil|  Karate chop!!  You can't destroy me!
Marceline|    No... D-dad... I-I don't wanna destroy you...  Look, just... stay out of my life!! 
Lord of Evil|  You're not even alive!
Finn|  You blew it, dude. We're supposed to be a team—a team whose sport is stop-your-dad-from-suckin'-souls... ball.
Marceline|   I just want my dad to care about me.
Lord of Evil|  Of all history's greatest monsters, you are by far the most evil thing I've encountered. Offer your soul to me, dark one.
Gunter|  Wenk wenk.
Lord of Evil|  NO! You can't have my soul! I don't even...! Look, just get in here.
Gunter|  Wenk wenk.
Lord of Evil|   Keep your crummy soul!
Ice King|  Gunter! Who told you you could fly?!
Gunter|   Wenk.
Ice King|  Huh? No one sucks the life from my penguins except me! ...And maybe polar bears, because that's just nature, Gunter.  You darest encroach upon my domain?!  You've raised my frosty dander! And for that, I shall—  AAAAAOOOOOHHH!! I've soiled my tunic... completely by choice! 
Lord of Evil|  YES!!
Finn|  Aw, man! He's growing huge!
Finn|  I'm gonna take 'im down!
Marceline|  Finn, you're like an ant to him.
Finn|  Oh, yeah? Well, this ant's about to get in his pants!
Marceline|   What?
Finn|   You know!  Because I'm going to make him uncomfortable while I release those souls! RAAAAAAAAGH!!!  Give up those souls, Marceline's dad! In the name of justice!!
Lord of Evil|  Huh?  Oh, Marceline. Still following me?
Marceline|  I'll stop following you if you give me back my guitar!
Lord of Evil|   No, Marceline.
Finn|   NO ONE FLICKS ME IN THE BUTT WITHOUT MY CONSENT!!!  Whoooaa!!  The souls... Lumpy Space Princess! He got your soul, too?!
Lumpy Space Princess|"  What? Nah. I totally saw Hot Dog Princess get sucked in here, and I wasn't invited?! I was all, ""What the lump?"" so I'm crashin' this party!"
Finn|  Well, I'll save you... I'LL SAVE ALL OF YOU!!
Marceline|  IN YOUR FACE, DAD!
Lord of Evil|  Give back that ax, Marceline! You don't respect it enough!
Marceline|  Well... you don't respect anything! Dad!! DAD!! I'm outta here!
Finn|  BUT—!!
Lord of Evil|  Fine!! Go!! I'm too busy sucking to deal with you!
Finn|  NO, WAIT! Marceline!! Keep talking to 'im! When he's talking, he can't steal souls!!
Marceline|  I said I'm outta here!
Finn|   Diversion... need... diversion. 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, my Glob, you guys! Drama bomb!
Lord of Evil|  Marceline, do you really feel this way?
Marceline|  Dad, I...
Lord of Evil|  Marceline... of course I love you.
Marceline|  Dad...
Lord of Evil|  I'm sorry I ate your fries. I didn't mean to hurt you.
Marceline|  It's okay, Dad. It's... it's really okay.
Lord of Evil|  No, it's not okay. They weren't even very good. They were really cold. I love you, Marceline. Don't you ever doubt that.
Marceline|  I love you, too, Dad.
Lord of Evil|   Oh, Marceline, I am so—
Finn|   YALALALALALALALALALALALALA!!!!!
Finn|  MALOSO VOBISCUM ET CUM SPIRITUM!!   I'll see you in the Nightosphere, ya sick freak.  YES!!!!
Marceline|  Finn!! How could you do that?!
Finn|  How could I... save the day?
Marceline|  How could you embarrass me like that and then stab my dad?!
Finn|  How could I embarrass-save you??  WHOA! Marceline!
Marceline|   I'm glad he's back in the Nightosphere. That was emotionally exhausting.
Finn|  I'm also exhausted emotionally. Or... wait. I mean, I mean physically.
Marceline|  I've been meaning to ask you... What's with that pocket on your shirt?
Finn|  Oh, Jake's in here. 'Sup, Jake?
Jake|   Are you okay, dude?
Finn|  Yeah, why?
Jake|  You look bored.
Finn|  Naw, that's just how I look when I'm listening to music.
Jake|  Well good, because I'm about to kick it up a notch.
Finn|  Bring it!
Finn|   Who do you think it is?
Jake|  Could be anybody. 
Finn|  Hmm... I can't quite make it out. 
Ice King|  Eee!
Finn|  Ahh! It's the Ice King!
Jake|  The Ice King?!
Ice King|  Think this is the right address,  mmm is this, is this....
Finn|   Eiiiiaah!
Jake|  Yeah! Kick his butt, dude!
Finn|  Eat my sword, Ice King! 
Finn|  Aww.
Ice King|  You can not defeat me, child!
Finn|  I will, though! With a sweet kick!  Psych! 
Jake|  Whoo, hoo hoo!
Ice King|   Now I can kill you! Oh wait, wait, wait. I am so stupid! Silly Billy! I came by to tell you the good news!
Finn|  What's the good news?
Ice King|  I'm getting married... to someone who wants to marry me! 
Ice King|  My betrothed is right over there!  Hi, honey!
Old Lady Princess|  Hey, cool guy.
Ice King|  I'm a lucky guy—I didn't even have to kidnap this one! She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring! 
Finn|  Eww.
Old Lady Princess|   Bye-bye!
Ice King|"  The lady penguins are throwing her one of those ""bachelorette"" parties."
Jake|   This is weird, dude.
Finn|  Hmm... if you get married, what about capturing princesses?
Ice King|  Oh well, no more capturing pretty princesses for this Ice King! 
Finn|  Ohhh...  well, fare thee well, Ice King!
Ice King|  Hmm?
Jake|  Yeah, good luck with ye and thy creepy wedding.
Finn|  We totally support your decision to stop capturing princesses!  I'm happy for him. 
Ice King|"   Sure wish someone would throw me a bachelorette party—oop, I mean, ""man-lorette"" party."
Finn|  But we hate you.
Ice King|  If you won't throw me man-lorette party, then I'll never have my last hurrah before buckling down with that battle axe! It'll drive me back to a life of stealing hot princesses! Is that what you want?!
Jake|  No. No, no, no, no, no.
Finn|   Dude, we gotta show him a good time and treat him right. Otherwise, he'll go back to imprisoning ladies! I-I can't have that! I—
Jake|   Shhh, I know. I know that you can't have that. Don't worry.  Alright, let's go party, Ice King.
Ice King|  
Ice King|   Best man-lorette party ever! 
Snowball|  
Ice King|  
Snowball|  
Ice King|  Fah!  Hahahaha! Now I'm gonna go get married! Hehehehe! ♫I'm gonna get married!♪
Finn|   Bye, Ice King! Good luck!
Jake|  Have fun being married!
Finn|  No more stealing princesses!
Ice King|  Yeah--wait. No more s-stealing princesses? Wow.
Finn & Jake|   What?!
Ice King|  I didn't realize I'd have to give up stealing the ladies.
Jake|  But you said you were fine with it!
Ice King|  I know what I said, but, y'know, sometimes you say things and then you don't really mean them.
Jake|  What? Are you serious?!
Ice King|  I'm just not sure I wanna get married in such a hurry. What if she's just after my  Demonic Wishing Eye and Ghost pouch? 
Finn|  We just took you out partying so that you could feel better about getting hitched!
Ice King|  Maybe I'll just go back to capturing lots of girls. It's what I feel comfortable doing, y'know? Being free, wind at my back, lots of girls, kidnapping 'em.
Finn|   Alright, here comes my double kick!
Jake|   Finn, Finn, cool yourself, buddy. We need to get this guy married, remember?
Finn|  Yeah, I remember.
Jake|  Watch.  Let big brother handle this.  Hey, Ice King? Don't be nervous. Marriage is the most beautiful thing that could ever happen to a jerk like you.
Ice King|  Really? Why?
Jake|"   ""Why?""  Poots, that guy is good. Why? Why?"
Finn|  Jake—
Jake|  Not now!  Why, why, why, why, why?
Ice King|  My mind is made up—80% sure. No marriage.
Finn|  Well, uh... don't you wanna grow old with somebody? Right?  Just like these old swans.
Ice King|  Bleh, those stinky old swans. Huh?
Finn & Jake|  What?!
Ice King|  Ohhhh, now I get what you guys are trying to tell me! Marriage is a thing that allows me to capture a princess forever and let her live inside of me!  Marriage is the most beautiful thing in the world!
Finn|  Uhh... Yeah—I-I never—uhh... I guess it is.  Jake, this is bad news, man! We gotta go tell him that he can't eat his wife!
Jake|  Eh, let's cross that bridge when we get to it. Look how happy he is.
Ice King|  The wedding? Back on—100%! 
Finn|   Phew!
Jake|  All that's left is the lousy wedding. 
Finn|  I'm weddy for the wedding!
Finn|  Y'know, even though the Ice King is a wad, I'm pretty happy for him.
Jake|  Uh-huh. This wedding looks lame, man.  Be prepared to be bored outta your mind.
Finn|  
Ice King|  Finn, Jake, you made it!  Come on up here. I'm almost finished tying up my bride.
Finn|  Weird—and your bride is into that?
Ice King|  This is a traditional wedding ritual for good luck in the Ice Kingdom. You see, she'll be hoisted up and then lowered down—and when she touches my beard from above, she will be my queen! 
Finn|  Well...  cool, man. I'm glad y'all are happy... being crazy together.
Ice King|  Thank you! Excuse me as we finish preparing for the nuptials. 2, 4, 8, 16, 20, uh—
Snowman Priest|  32.
Ice King|  Yes—32, 64, one hundred and—eh.
Finn|  Huh? Her eyes are huge! I'm gonna go check 'em out.  And stop scratching your ear, man—it's gross.
Jake|  It wasn't me—it was my foot, dude.
Finn|   Whoa, you've got ridiculously large eyes, princess! Are you allergic to somethin'?
Old Lady Princess|   No, Finn. I was just born like this.
Finn|  Why are you crying?
Old Lady Princess|  I'm not crying, Finn—my tear sac is broken!
Old Lady in eye|  Help me!
Finn|  What?!
Old Lady Princess|  I didn't say anything.
Old Lady in eye|  The Ice King cursed me! You've gotta set me free. I would rather die than marry the Ice King!
Finn & Jake|  
Finn|  He tricked me! And I was happy for that son of a toot!
Jake|   Look at her ring.
Ice King|  She fell in love with me the moment I slipped on her engagement ring.
Finn|  That's what cursed her! Don't worry, princess. I'll remove this ring and save your life. 
Ice King|  No! She's my love boat! 
Finn|  No, man. You cursed her. She hates you!
Ice King|  Okay, that's your opinion! 
Jake|  Wait a minute!  So you knew she was cursed all along, which means you knew she wasn't trying to steal your Demonic Eye Junk or whatever, and you knew you had total control of her!
Ice King|  Yeah, yes, that's right.
Jake|  So then why did you make us go through all that junk about why marriage is worth stuff?!
Ice King|  Oh, I don't know... I'm complicated—and spontaneous!  That's probably why she wants to marry me!
Jake|  She wants to marry you because you brainwashed her!
Ice King|  Silence! 
Finn & Jake|  Whoa, wait!  Aw, man!
Ice King|  It's time for the lowering ceremony! Hoist her up!
Ice King|  Hehehehe! Commence the lowering!
Ice King|  Yes, nothing can stop me now.
Finn|  Hyah!  What is wrong with you, man?! 
Ice King|  Strangling the groom's nose at a wedding?  What's wrong with you?! You're the one that there's something wrong with!
Jake|  Gotcha!
Old Lady in eye|  Thanks, man
Jake|  Hehe, no problem.
Finn|   Ehh.
Ice King|   I think you dropped something.  Catch! 
Finn|  Huh? 
Jake|  Whoa! 
Finn|  Jake!
Old Lady Princess|   Huh, what?
Finn|  JAKE!  Grrrr.  Oh, hey.
Jake|  Hey.
Finn|  You got the ring off her finger?
Jake|  Huh? Oh. Oh yeah. Now she's not hypnotized, but we're still frozen.
Finn|  I got a plan.
Jake|  Oh, good.
Ice King|  Now, let's try that again.  Lower her!
Old Lady Princess|   You lousy, butt-faced pig! I hate you!
Ice King|  Here she comes. Yes, touch my beard, deary. Yes, that's right. Almost there...
Finn|  Now!
Jake|  
Ice King|  Oh! I'm married, right, snowman?
Snowman Priest|  Yes, it's official.
Finn|  It's official! You done married a dog, dude!
Ice King|  What? What's that supposed to—  Oh no.
Finn & Jake|  
Jake|  Wait, what the—? What am I laughin' about?
Finn|   And now everything's back to normal.
Jake|  Well, I wouldn't say everything.
Ice King|   Come on, guys. Help me celebrate my un-marriage.
Finn & Jake|  
Grob Gob Glob Grod| Denise, we have concluded you're an interesting and conventionally hot woman. My siblings and I would like to request a date with you. Are you available for a date with Glob on Saturday, Grod on Friday, Grob on Thursday or Gob on Sunday? Please select your dates now.
Party God| Ahhh-rooo! That's nice.
Cloud kid 1| Eat it, Lich!
Cloud Kid 2| Eat it, Lich!
Both| Woooh!
Jake| What?! No more crackers? Eeeee.  Prismo! Prismo! Hey man, Hey!
Prismo| Heeeey.
Jake| Bad news, you ran out of cheese crackers.
Prismo| What! No.
Jake| Yeah, man, what are you going to do about it? 
Prismo| Jaaake.  I'm Prismo the wish master. We can have all the cheesy crackers we want.
Jake| Prismo, you make me happy, Prismo.
Prismo|  Oh, stop.
Jake| I'm always smiling when I'm around you. I just noticed that. I always am.
Prismo| I'm always smiling when I'm around you, too.
Jake|  This feels so good.
Both Prismo and Jake| Peppermint Butler! Death!
Jake| What's up.
Peppermint Butler| Hey umm, those guys are doing selfies on The Lich. Is that safe?
Grob Gob Glob Grod| Definitely going to send these to Denise.
Prismo| Oh yeah, it's fine, he's harmless.
Peppermint Butler| Yeah, but why isn't he killing everyone in the room right now? Controlling our minds, making us rip each others eyes out while we buttercup one another?
Prismo| Well, The Lich's primary function is to cause mass death. And since he can't do that while he is trapped in my Time Room,  he's stuck in a standstill, like a machine without a purpose.
Peppermint Butler| I am so scared right now.
Death| Yikes.
Jake| Aw, don't worry, he ain't gonna hurt nobody.
Jake| Ha! You got a cup on your head. Ha-ha, you dingus!  See, he's docile as a lamb.
Peppermint Butler|  Hmm. Well, okay, then I guess I can go for a selfie, too.
Jake| Yeah, man, make your dreams come true.
Jake| Oh, what time is it?  Hey, yo, Clock Face, what time is it?!
Clock Face| It's 1230.
Jake| Aw, boo to that! Yo, Prismo I gotta get back before Finn realizes I'm not home. He gets worried if I stay out too long.
Prismo| All right, later, dude.
Jake| Laters.
Finn| Jake, where were you?
Jake|  I was, umm, in the, uh... All right, man, I'm gonna come clean. I've been doing a lot of partying at Prismo's lately.
Jake| Come on, man! I don't even take Lady up there.
Finn| Dude, I found out my human dad is still alive.
Jake| Whoa, what?
Finn|  He's at some place called the Citadel.
Jake| Whoa.  Are you gonna go see him?
Finn| I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't. Maybe there's a good reason why he didn't raise me. Like, he was probably captured by thieves and kept a slave for years.
Jake| Yeah, or maybe he was ambushed in the wild and hid you so you wouldn't be captured, too.
Finn| Yeah, maybe it's better not to rock the boat.
Jake| But... it might also be good to find out if you have any genetic risk factors or allergies or whatever. Plus, you get to see what you'll look as an old guy. Could be cool.
Finn| Heh. I guess it would be okay to meet him, just to know what I'll look like.
Jake| Cool. Oh! If we hurry, Prismo might be still partying.
Cosmic Owl| Come on, just one more game.
Prismo| I don't know, mang, I was just gonna clean up and crash out.
Cosmic Owl|  Oh, yeah! More players! 
Cosmic Owl| You guys wanna play some Card Wars?
Jake|  No. Prismo, we need to get to the Citadel.
Prismo| Whoa! You guys do not wanna go there. Seriously.  Check this out.  The Citadel is a nasty-sized prison. Only the worst of the worst end up there. Real stink faces. These guys are the pits—the armpits.
Finn| Hey, my dad must be like the warden there.
Jake| I know you can't grant Finn and me any more wishes. So, we brought Shelby along to wish on our behalf.
Shelby| Hello.
Prismo| Oh, look at that, a little guy.
Shelby| So, I wish for ... a pony for my GF!
Prismo| Done.
Jake|  Shelby!
Shelby| Sorry, dudes. My girl's been hounding me for a pony for months. I'm gonna get mad points for this.   Oh, hi! So you got it? That's great! You like him? Uh huh ... you gonna name him what? Speedboat? Yeah, that's a good one. 
Jake|  Dang, Shelby.
Prismo| A wish wouldn't have worked anyway. You can only get to The Citadel committing a cosmic crime.
Jake| So, what do we gotta do? Rob a cosmic bank? Steal a space baby? 
Cosmic Owl|  Oh, uh, I just remembered I gotta go home. Gotta groom my feathers  Goodbye! Goodbye! 
Prismo| Listen, if you guys are serious about this,  all you gotta do is find a certain sleeping old man and bring him here.
Jake| That's it? 
Prismo| Yep. He's on one of those floating islands out there. It kind of looks like an upside-down duck.
Jake| That doesn't seem much of a crime.
Prismo| Yeah, but that's all there is to it.  For now.
Jake| What?
Prismo| Check it out! I got gifts for you guys.
Finn| Ha, cool it's a penlight.  Jake, don't look directly me in the—Aaah!
Jake| Come on, Finn let's go find this old guy.
Prismo| Oh! One last thing, dudes.  Whatever you do, don't wake him up.  Okay, you can go now.
Finn|  Pew! Pew!
Finn| You ever wonder what happened to make a place all wrecked up like this?
Jake| Nope. Hey, upside-down duck! 
Jake| No, wait, it's right side up.
Jake| Aha!
Jake|  Hey! Get out here, old man!
Finn|  Dude, shh. Don't wake him up.
Jake|  Hey, get out here, old man.
Finn| Pizow! 
Finn| Old man.
Jake|  Uh oh!  Finn, a little help?
Finn| Bizzow
Jake| Gizzow
Finn| Let's hoof it!
Finn| Jake, don't jostle the package.
Finn| Yahct!  All right! 
Finn| There's too many of them!
Jake| Let's see here.
Prismo| Oh, hey, your back.
Jake|  Dude's got serious night terrors. 
Finn|  What now, Prismo?
Prismo| Okay, wake him up.
Both| Finn and Jake What?!
Prismo| Yeah,  I just wanted one last look at myself.
Finn| Wait, this old man is you?
Prismo| That's right Prismo is nothing than dream of a wrinkly old man. Man, I've gotten a lot hairier, but also balder? Tell me how that makes any sense. I'm like a big ol' hairy raisin.
Jake| So, wait, what happens to him when we wake him up?
Prismo| Poof! I'm a goner. Thus ends mighty Prismo.
Jake|  Prismo.
Prismo| Killing a wish master is a cosmic crime. Once I'm dead, the guardian will show up and take you to The Citadel.
Finn| I don't think seeing my dad is worth sacrificing your life
Prismo| Ah, don't worry. As soon as my corporeal body falls back asleep again,  in a thousand years,  I'll be back.
Jake| You sure about this?
Prismo| Hold on, let me take one last look around.
Prismo| Huh, thought I'd own more stuff by now. Okay, let's do it!
Jake| Still feels like a bad idea, man.
Prismo| Pssh! What could go wrong?
The Lich| Wake up.
Prismo| Wa—Wait, I've changed my mind— 
Jake| Prismo, don't worry! I'll put the old man to sleep and get you back!
Finn| Dude! That means The Lich jacked our entry into The Citadel.
Jake| Aw, no man, how are you gonna see your dad?!
Old man Prismo| Hello? Who are you guys? Could any of you strangers tell me how to go home? I'm done with my nap.
Jake| Old man Prismo.
Old man Prismo| I just woke up from my nap, but I'm ready to go back to bed. I'd like to go home and take a nap.
Jake| No, old man Prismo, don't talk to him.
Old man Prismo| Are you my son?
Jake| Old man Prismo! No! 
Finn| Oh, dang! I think they're going to the Citadel! I'M COMING, DADDEEEEEEE!
Jake|   Dude! Shooting star! Make a wish!
Finn|   That's not a shooting star.  It's just a firefly.
Finn|  What are you gonna wish for dude?
Jake|  Oh, you know. That something special only two bros can share.
Finn|   I think I'm wishing for the same thing!
Jake|  You mean the...
Finn and Jake|  Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!
Jake|  Oh, man I wanna ride it so bad!
Finn|  How do you even control those things?
Jake|  You can't control it dude. You have to let it give you control.
Finn|  Oh wow!
Jake|  Start wishin'!
Finn|  What the...
Hot Dog Princess|"   That's a distress flare from my other Hot Dog Knights. I sent them to rescue my other other Hot Dog Knights who got trapped in a labyrinth! Their message says... ""Baby... us... trouble... time...."" They must be in grave danger!  Hot Dog Knights are slow. "
Finn|  Don't worry, princess. Jake and I are on it.
Finn|  Whoa! Fudge, man! This place is yoga balls huge! 
Jake|   Yoga balls aren't that really huge, dude.
Finn|  Hey, man, I can't analyze everything that comes out of my mouth.
Jake|   Should we like, try to cheat and stretch over the walls?
Finn|  Nah, man. Look.
Jake|  Okay, well... then... I'll just hook my legs around this stump and stretch us through so we don't get lost. Like this, see? 
Finn|   You're a cool guy, Jake. 
Jake|  Thank you.
Finn|  Man, there're so many passage ways and stuff. It'll take us forever to find those Hot Dog Kni-iights?
Hot Dog Knight #1|   Don't eat me, man!
Jake|  Nah, we're here to save you, guy!
Hot Dog Knight #2|   Oh, thank the stars. We were lost!
Hot Dog Knight #3|  How didn't you guys get lost?
Finn|  We're just gonna follow Jake's body back.
Hot Dog Knight #1|  At the centre of the maze, there's a magic creature that grants wishes.
Finn|  Wishes?  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Finn and Jake|  Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!
Jake|  This is our chance!
Hot Dog Knights| Hot dog!
Jake|   Hold on boys, we're gonna get us some wishes!
Jake|  Choo-choo. 
Finn|   Dang, Jake. Your body's getting thin!
Jake|  Yeah, I got a nice bod!
Finn|  Yeah, but now...  not so nice.
Jake|  Okay, well you can take your weird body issues and tuck them somewhere private. Where I can take my healthy body issues... and  FIGHT A GOLEM!
Golem|  TRESPASSERS! 
Finn|  Wrap 'im up, Jake!
Jake|  I'm on it! 
Jake|   Stop flexing. I can't... stretch.... any more.
Hot Dog Knight #2|   You can do it, Jake! Stretch stretch stretch! Wrap him up more!
Jake|  Come on baby.
Jake|   Golem... taken care of... dudes.
Hot Dog Knight #1|  Jake, you're amazing.
Finn|  Jake, you need to take it easy on the stretching, man.
Hot Dog Knight #2|  Wha... n-no Jake, you can keep going, man. Right guys? Come on, Jake, you can go!
Hot Dog Knights|  Jake! Jake! Jake!
Jake|   Hehe.  Alright. Come on, Finn. The stretching train is leaving the station. Choo-choo.
Jake|  Just gotta keep stretchin'.
Finn|  Uh, yeah.  Wait! Stop, Jake. Ya hear that?
Jake|  No.
Finn|  This place is weirding me out. Keep your eyes open for traps and junk.
Jake|  Whoa! Check that out!
Finn|  Oh, snap! That's you dude.
Jake|  Hmm.
Finn|   Boop.
Jake|  Hey, man. Watch it. I think that's my nerp, but like super stretched out.
Finn|   Boop boop. Boop boop boop boop boop.
Jake|   Stop man!
Jake|   NERP!
Finn|  Oh my Grob! 
Hot Dog Knight #1|   It's okay, hot dogs are immune to poison.
Finn|  Sick!
Jake|  I got it! 
Jake|  Owowowowowowowowow.
Hot Dog Knights|  Jake! Jake! Jake!
Jake|   I'm good, man. It's the small scorpions you gotta worry about. Or is that just with snakes?  Oop, nope, wait, poison's kickin' in. 
Hot Dog Knights|  No Jake no!
Hot Dog Knight #4|  Work through the pain! Let's get wishes!
Hot Dog Knights|  Wishes!
Jake|   Alright, you guys, hop on!  Let's do it.
Finn|   I don't think this is a good idea, man.
Jake|   I'm fine, brother. We'll have that war elephant in no time!
Finn|  Ah, uh, okay...
Finn|   Woah!  Hmm, looks like the final puzzle. You think you can stretch up there, buddy.
Jake|   Yes.
Finn|   Whoa! Jake, you okay?!
Jake|  Huh, yeah, I just... can't close my eyes... lids... too tight.
Finn|   Okay, dude this is too far! No more maze, we're going home.
Jake|  Yeah... I'm feeling a little thin.
Hot Dog Knights|   No! Don't stop! Keep stretching!
Hot Dog Knight #2|  You stretch good!
Hot Dog Knights|  Jake! Jake! Jake! Woohoo!
Jake|  Ah, alright.
Finn|  Jake, no! You're gonna get hurt.
Jake|   I'm goin' for it!
Finn|  Jake, no!
Jake|   Done!
Finn|  That must be the wishes!
Hot Dog Knight #2|   Kitty!
Finn|  You did it, man. No we can go wish for a...
Finn and Jake|   Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant.
Jake|   Gotta move carefully. My internal organs are super stretched, I'm paper thin!
Hot Dog Knight #2|   I love kitties!
Hot Dog Knight #2|  I am sorry!
Jake|  Ow! Ooh!
Finn|   JAKE! 
Jake|  My insides are all mashes up!
Finn|  I knew we should have turned back!
Jake|  You were right. I pushed myself too far. I'll never fall victim to peer pressure again!
Hot Dog Knight #4|  No! Jake! Jake! Jake!
Jake|  Actually, I'll do anything you guys want if you say my name three times. 
Finn|  Just hang tight, buddy. I'll use my wish to save you.
Aquandrius|  Congratulations, warriors.  Step forward, and take your wishes.
Hot Dog Knight #1|   Ah! I'm gonna wish for a hat! Woohoo.
Aquandrius|  Who's next?
Hot Dog Knight #3|  Nuh-uh, that floor got traps! Jake should stretch us across
Hot Dog Knight #4|  Jake! Jake! Jake!
Jake|  Here we go!  Ooh.
Finn|   No! Jake is all jacked up.
Hot Dog Knight #3|  Then how else can we get wishes?!
Finn|  Jake! Get up and carry us across!
Jake|  But I'm too weak!
Jake|  Yeaargh! That's it, I'm dead. 
Finn|  Jake! Stay with me, man!
Jake|  Nah.
Finn|  But we did it, okay! I can wish you out of here, man!
Aquandrius|  Oh yes, now you may each receive your wishes. For real!  But be warned. There are no do overs!
Finn|  Okay,  So you guys should wish to get your buddies back, right?
Hot Dog Knight #4|  I wish for a box!  Sweet!
Hot Dog Knight #3|  And I wish to blow up! I mean like get big! 
Finn|  Wow, you guys are really stupid.
Hot Dog Knight #4|   What do you mean?
Aquandrius|   Dog, you're next! What do you wish?
Jake|  Huh?
Finn|  Jake! Wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant! Then I'll wish to save you!
Jake|  Right. So hard to think on an empty stomach. I wish I wasn't so hungry. 
Finn|  You wasted your wish, man!
Jake|  I know. You should wish for the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant. It's what we wanted.
Finn|  That's crazy, man! I gotta save your life.
Jake|  Do it... for... me!
Finn|  I... wish... for... the Ancient PSYCHIC TANDEM WAR ELEPHANT!
Jake|  Yes!
Aquandrius|  Your wish is granted.
Jake|  It has to give you control! Remember!
Finn|  I'm on it.  Rah!  Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant. HEAR ME!
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant|   Finn the Human! Are you worthy to command me? 
Finn|   You know I am, because you're psychic!  Now wish for my friends to be healed!
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant|   I wish... for what Finn... desires.
Jake|  Yeah, boyyy!
Aquandrius|  No! You weren't supposed to have your wishes come true!  You were supposed to die!
Finn|  Now, bust us outta here!
Aquandrius|  No! 
Finn|  Yeah, boyyy!
BMO|"  Jake, if I beat you, you have to call me ""sensei"" for a month."
Jake|  Deal.
Turtle Princess|  Hi, guys!
Finn, Jake, & BMO|  'Sup, Turtle Princess?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh! Get your hands off me, Steven!! YAH!  And you, too, Chad! 
Turtle Princess|  Heeeey, giiiirl!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Heeeey, giiiirl!
Turtle Princess|  Brought you some little fruit pies.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Awesome. 
Turtle Princess|  How ya doin' out here?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Turtle Princess, the men out here will not leave me alone!
Turtle Princess|  Huh... it must be nice.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Nah. It's horrible. They just want me for my lumps!  These lumps aren't for SALE, BILLY!   Aren't you sick of men going after your turtle lumps?
Turtle Princess|  Actually, I've never been able to work my T-lumps. I just know what I read in books.  Hey! You should write a book telling me how to do it!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, my Glob! Turtle Princess! I've always wanted to write trashy books for ladies!  YAH!  BACK UP OFF ME, RICKY!!  Yeah, everyone needs to know when I work these lumps, no man is immune to their influence!
Finn|  Jake's ball landed over here, BMO!
Turtle Princess|   LSP! Finn would be perfect as the test subject for your lump studies!
BMO|  Yay! I win!  Bow to your sensei!
Jake|  Aaah...
Finn|  Heh heh heh heh heh heh!
Turtle Princess|   You gotta go undercover and conduct your lump science on him. Prove to the world that even a white knight like Finn is no match for the power of your lumps!
Lumpy Space Princess|  I'll do it! For the world! And for you, girl!
Turtle Princess|  Oh, girl!
Lumpy Space Princess|   Day one on my way to Finn and Jake's. Side-note I look fresh to death with my new dress and purse. Mm! Mm! Mm! 
Jake|  Hello?
Lumpy Space Princess|   Heeey, Jaaaake... Is Finn hooome...?
Jake|   Ooh!
Finn|  'Sup, LSP?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, hey. I'm answering that ad you put out for the adventure secretary.
Finn|  Wha?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Ugh... Hold on. I'll get it.  Hold on. It's down in there. Okay, wait, I got it. Uh, here you go.
Finn|"   ""WANTED—ADVENTURE SECRETARY.""  Smells like fruit pie."
Jake|  It's nice of you to wanna be our secretary... but we don't need one.
Finn|   Dude, look at 'er.
Lumpy Space Princess|   Mmm... Oh, Glob...
Finn|  Yeah, it's sad. Come on. We've gotta help 'er.
Jake|  Alright, LSP. Come inside.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Awesome.  Totally nailed the interview. 
Lumpy Space Princess|  I'm gonna need a secretary desk!  and puts her working equipment. Finn and Jake just look at each other.] I'm starving! What's for dinner?!
Finn|  Oh. Uh...  We got some blueberries.
Jake|  Jake has saltines.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Yuck.  Looks like I'll have to bust out these cobras to get a better dinner.  Hey, Finn...  You got anything better to eat??
Finn|   Oh, cool. Old spaghetti. I'm gonna go heat this up. 
Lumpy Space Princess|"   Chapter 1 ""Gotcha!"""
Finn|   Have a good night. See ya in the mornin'.
Lumpy Space Princess|  G'night, you guys!   Finn is even more overpowered by my lumps than I thought. I guess at the end of the day, it's all about the lumps.  and she answers it.]
Turtle Princess|   Hey, girl.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, Turtle Princess! This book is coming out awesome!
Turtle Princess|  Oh, good, girl! I can't wait to read it!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Thanks, girl.
Turtle Princess|  Goodnight, girl.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Goodnight, girl. 
Lumpy Space Princess|  What's that?
Jake|  'Sup, LSP?
Lumpy Space Princess|  What're you guys doing?
Finn|  We're carrying these rocks on an adventure, up to the Mystery Mountains.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, nuh-uh, I am not gonna carry rocks!
Finn|  That's okay. Jake can carry 'em.
Jake|  Yup.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Ugh... Fine...  You're welcome, Finn.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Ugh... My arms weren't meant to carry so many rocks, you guys!
Finn|  C'mon, LSP. You can make it.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Uuoohhh...  and she answers.] Turtle Princess, you can't call me! You're gonna blow my cover!
Turtle Princess|  Good morning, girl.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Good morning, girl.
Turtle Princess|  Would you be mad at me if I ask out Billy, that vulture who was hitting on you? I think he's cute and I would—
Finn|  Hey, LSP, shake a leg.
Lumpy Space Princess|   Can't talk right now, girl! 
Finn|  The Loch of Phantoms. Princess Bubblegum said the rocks would show us the safe path. 
Lumpy Space Princess|   This is way too boring for my book.  Oh... my shoulder strap... Oh, my orange juice is comin' out... Ha! Gotch—Huh? 
Finn|"  Haha! Jake! ""Ker-ploop."""
Jake|"  Heh heh heh! ""Ker-ploop."""
Lumpy Space Princess|  Not... gotcha?
Finn|  Alright!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Ugh! This place is plops, Finn!
Finn|  We can meetcha back at the tree house later if you want.  That weird light...
Lumpy Space Princess|  Hey, Finn! Finn, my dress is slipping!!
Finn|   Huh? Listen, LSP, we've gotta be carefu—
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oooh, my dress...
Finn|  No, LSP! It's not safe!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Heeeeeeey...  Oh. Hey, Fiiiiinn...
Finn|  She's stuck in there!
Jake|  We gotta bust through this wall!
Lumpy Space Princess|  I knew you couldn't resist me, Finn.  Oh, lump. I took it too far!  My powerful lumps have turned Finn into a grody monster! Get away, Finn! AAH, NO, AAAAAH!!!  OH, I CAN'T LOOK!  Aah!
Lumpy Space Princess|  That was so crazy! What just happened?!
Finn|  Oh. Uh, Bubblegum sent us on a quest to destroy these cursed mirrors. Evil stuff happens when you look into them.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, Glob... I had to look because I looked so good!
Finn|  LSP... you don't need a mirror to know you look good.  You're beautiful on the inside. Like... your brain and stuff!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Thanks for sayin' that stuff... and for saving me from those mirror-yous. That was pretty nice.
Lumpy Space Princess|"  Okay. Time to write. Gonna make this... trashy. Turtle Princess'll be all,  ""Oh, my gosh! Number one best-seller!"" Hah... Yeah.   What's he doing out there?"
Jake|  Sometimes, after an adventure, he likes to sit out there and think. 
Lumpy Space Princess|   Hello?
Turtle Princess|  Hey, girl. Are you almost done with your book?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh... I'm working on it! I've been doing so much research!
Turtle Princess|  Did Finn fall victim to your lumps?
Lumpy Space Princess|   Um... yeah...
Turtle Princess|  Great! Bring in your manuscript right away! Click! 
Lumpy Space Princess|   Yeah... A book about how I'm hot, and Finn only wants... He's so... hot.  ...Finn has the hottest lumps, but his lumps are on the inside! YAAAAGH!!  HE'S GREAT!
Finn|  Uh... Bye, LSP.
Turtle Princess|  This isn't what you said it'd be about...
Lumpy Space Princess|  I know, I—
Turtle Princess|  I LOVE IT!
Lumpy Space Princess|  OH, MY GLOB!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Finn! You've probably been wondering where I've been for the last few hours!
Finn|  Oh. Yeah! Yeah, I have.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Finn... I was never really your secretary, Finn. I was writing a book about how you were a slave to my lumps because I'm so hot, Finn!!
Finn|   Oh. Okay.
Lumpy Space Princess|  But you're the one who's hot, Finn!!
Finn|  Wow. Uh, thanks!
Lumpy Space Princess|  No... thank you. 
Jake|  LSP, YOU'RE WEARING GARBAGE FOR CLOTHES!!!!
Lumpy Space Princess|   Gotcha... 
Cuber|  Oh, hello.  Here for more graybles, I presume. Well you've come to the right computer-fable. Feast your eyes-mabel, on my holo-pyramid viewer and—  Huh? What's that? Not in the mood for graybles, you say? Oh dear. You okay? Did something fatlabel happen to you?  Oh, I see. You'd rather watch me buh-blabel a bird-house in my workshop.  Hm. More of a grayble man by trade. But okay! Come on! 
Cuber| Oh, hello again! As you can see, the bird-house is nearly complete! All that's left is where the door hole goes. But I can't remember.  Hm. Door hole. Wait! I just remembered! My door hole solution lies in one of tonight's scheduled graybles! Would you mind I look through them to find it?  OK!  Yeey! Here we go!
Jake|  Hey, Jake Jr.  You having fun at daddy's?
Jake Jr.| Hm? Oh. Sure dad.
Jake| OK. You seem kind of dump trucks.
Jake Jr.| What?
Jake|" You know, ""in the dumps."""
Jake Jr.| Oh, sorry. It's cool. I'm just thinking about the future, I guess. We're on, like, the bleeding edge of history. Everything ahead of us is totally unknown and there's no guarantee that things are going to be all right. It's exciting, but it's also pretty scary. You know?
Jake|   Sounds like my little baby girl wanna build a time machine!
Finn| Ooooh!
Jake Jr.| Guys, I don't—
Jake| No, no, no. Leave it up to your daddy and uncle Finn!  Yup.
Jake Jr.| OK, you guys have fun! I'm gonna get some more juice.  Mom has some weird taste in men. 
Finn|  Pssst. She's going back!
Jake|  Ding-ding!  Scre-e-e-ech! 
Finn|   Hello? Oh! Is that the machine part that I ordered?
Jake|  You just gotta sign for it, to prove you accepted delivery. 
Finn|  Ac-cept-tance.
Jake Jr.| Guys, I'm basically thirty. I'm not a little kid anymore!
Princess Bubblegum|  You're not a little kid anymore!
Cinnamon Bun|  WHY-Y-Y-Y!?
Princess Bubblegum| Cinnamon Bun, you can't sleep with a night-light anymore. You're basically thirty—it's starting to bum everyone out.
Cinnamon Bun|  I can't handle this denial of light!!!
Princess Bubblegum| Yeah, well—
Cinnamon Bun|  No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!  Too dark.  No! It's too bright!  Ah! It's too dark!  Oh. A-ha. OK. This is nice.
Banana Guards|  
Cinnamon Bun| Ah! Too dark! 
Banana Guard|  Hey, Cinnabun!
Cinnamon Bun| I—need—soft—light!  Yeeargh!!
Ice King|  Yeeargh! How long has this been in here? I don't even remember buying this. Oh well—easy come, easy go.  Goodbye! Well, that wasn't so bad.   Hm. 
Ice King|  Ah! Nothing like a hard day's work to get them spirits a-lifted! 
Ice King|"  Great news, fellas! I finished all my chores, so we can start movie night early. Take your sits and will reveal the nominees. We got ""Baby Ballet,"" ""Blimby's ""WHO GOTS DA ABC'S"","" ""Airplanes Taking Off,"" —  Oh, wait! What's this one? ""Basic Mortality Season 1""!? Isn't this that show that everyone is talking about? I heard that this show is really good for penguins. Wow, that's really lucky for you guys, I'm a little jealous. Well anyway, good luck to all our nominees! OK, all in favor of ""Blimby's ""WHO GOTS DA ABC'S""""—raise your hands."
Ice King|" OK, all in favor of ""Baby Ballet""—raise your hands."
Ice King|" OK, all in favor of Air—What!? ""Baby Ballet""? Come on! Ugh! I should have never given you penguins the right to vote. Well, you may have numbers on your side, but I still have one trick up my sleeve. Bargaining. Whereby, you let me watch ""Basic Mortality,"" and I in return will do anything you want in the whole world. How 'bout it?"
Middle Penguin| Wenk.
Ice King| Algebraic!
Man| I know he was your partner.
Woman| Enough! Alan is not the super-murderer!
Ice King| I don't know about this show though—
Man| This, captain, is the most lamentable super-murder I've ever seen—and I've seen plenty.
Ice King| —might be a touch too dark.
Cinnamon Bun|  Too dark!   Too bright! 
Lemongrab 2|  Eat on it! 
Lemongrab|  Hm-m-m.
Lemongrab 2|  Hm.
Lemongrab 2| Oh, little Lemon-Sweets, our son.  So precious. You enjoy sitting in your chair?  What would you like to do now?  Go to bed.
Lemongrab| No, he wants to dance! 
Lemongrab 2|  Dearest brother, I really think Lemon-Sweets would rather go to bed. 
Lemongrab 2|  I'll fetch our son a sleeping bonnet.  Beautiful.    Brother, stop that!!
Lemongrab|   We hate you.
Lemongrab|  O-O-Only O-O-O-ONE!!! 
Lemongrab 2|  The end! My end!
Mr. Fox| My end... table, my love seat, yeah. Gee but it's great to be back home. It's always a blast visiting my cousin, city-Fox, at his future palace, but you just can't beat that old country steez. City-Fox's digs be mad sterile. Look a this. This was my grandpa's rug. Some bums let him have it 'cause it was so ugly.   And check out these classic stylings. They don't make 'em like this anymore!  Wow! Haha! Almost got me right in my both eyes!  Look at my bugs.  Man, I always did have the ugliest bugs. What are they doing? Selling each other houses?
Mr. Fox|"  Yes, siree, there's some things money can't buy.  You see that depression? You can't buy that, you gotta earn it. Boy, it's like I can almost see myself sleeping in there.   Wha—?  ""Dear conscious self, I know where some buried treasure is. I'll draw you a map. Love, subconscious self."" Oh my gosh, I'm gonna be rich!  "
Mr Fox| What the—?  Oh, no! My riches!
Cinnamon Bun|   Let me in!   It's too—bright!  Too dark!  
Mr. Fox| Cinnamon Bun, you!  Did a great job, on this hole wall. It's very rustic. 
Sub-conscious Mr. Fox| M-m-m-m, what a jerk.
Finn| What, a jerk?
Jake| Yeah, just give it a little jerk.
Finn| Now that's a time machine.
Jake| Hey, sweetie! Sweetie, look! Your time machine's all ready!
Jake Jr.| Aw yeah, you havin' fun, dad?
Jake| Aw, anything for my baby pup.
Jake Jr.| OK. As long as you're having fun.
Jake|  Time machine! 
Cuber| Ha-ha! There it is! You see? The birdhouse door—it's right above the peg thingy. Why didn't I think of that?  Well, I guess that's it for this week. I'll see you crimpy glimmers on the—what? What's that? You want to finish the grayble?  You want to see if you can still guess the theme?  You just want to see how it ends.  Well, let's get right to it, then. Ha-ha.
BMO| Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! Stranger! 
BMO| Excuse me.
Jake Jr.|  HEY, why are you trying to steal my dad's stuff!?!
Cinnamon Bun| Hey, I need a night-light because I'm so scared!
Jake Jr.| Man, you can't steal, dummy.
Jake Jr.| Fine!  Here. NOW GET LOST!
Cinnamon Bun|   Yes! Take that, Princess Bubblegum! 
BMO| Jake Jr., I'm sorry for messing up your time travel.
Jake Jr.| Aw, that's OK.  It was just make-believe, anyways.
Finn| O-ho-ho, was it? Then how do you explain tomorrow's newspaper?
Finn| Haha! Time to protect the sun!
Jake| Ha ha! Yeah, he knows how to get things started.
Finn| Firepit number 1. Easy-peasy, livin' greasy! You wonder why they even put it there.
Jake| It's probably a computel gleetch.
Jake| Now comes some real trouble! It's Bouncy Bee! He's gonna get that sun, man!
Finn| Haha! Please.  Bleep!
Finn| I had my eyes closed on that one!
Jake| Yeah, that was cool. Oh, oh, you missed a coin, dude, go back!
Finn| I ain't in it for the money, man. I'm in it to crush the enemies of the sun. Like this sloppy butt right here.
Jake| Hunny Bunny!
Finn| I'm like, Hunny Bunny, don't you ever learn? I've always got the bomba! 
Jake| Man, you are hot tonight! Think you can do it this time? Can you beat Sleepy Sam?!
Finn| Oh, I very can!
Jake| Remember use a combo move!
Finn| Okay! Here goes.
Finn and Jake together| Up, down, left, left, right, right, down-
Jake| Spin, down, up, left, faster, dude! Right, left, down!
Finn| Aww! Every time!  BMO, this game is the worst! If we were really inside that game, man, we would crush Sleepy Sam. Breezily! With my mitts!
BMO| Oh no! It's much more dangerous than you think!
Finn| Whoa, whoa, wait!
Jake| BMO, is there a way for us to get in the game for real?
BMO| Yes, of course, Jake.  If I push this button-
BMO| If I push this button, you will both be dangerously transported into my main brain game frame where it is very dangerous!
Finn| Oh, man. Oh, BMO! You gotta let us in that game!
BMO| No! It's a far too dangerous incredible adventure for you! It's final.
Finn| Oh. Okay, BMO. Well, time for bed!
Jake| ...Finn?
Finn| Time for bed. Right, Jake? 
Jake| ...oh, right! Heh heh. Good night, BMO.  Time for bed! 
Finn| We're in the game!
Jake| Look! There's the sunshine we gotta protect!  And there's a hole we're supposed to go down!  And there's you...doing whatever you're doing. 
Finn|  I'm looking at my bits! My leg is math!
Jake|  Mmm. That sunshine feels good. Feels good all over!
Finn|  No wonder all the monsters in this game want to get their grubby mitts on it! Let's go kick their digital bootays!  Doo! Doo! Doo! Doo doo! Doo!
Jake|   Beep boop! Beep boop!
Finn|  ♫ We are in the computer world. We're computer boys, not computer girls. ♫
Jake|  ♫ In a game, I can be who I virtually am. ♫
Finn|  ♫ I can walk and sing, I can kill Silly Sam! ♫
Jake|   Hey, what stinks?  Smells like...
Finn|  Pit!  Looks a mite bigger inside the game...
Jake|  Jumpin' over this pit is easy, remember? We could do this backwards with our eyes closed!  Ahh! I'm burning!
Finn|  Jake!!
Jake|  Haha. What, man?
Finn|  Whaa?! Jake, what the shake?
Jake|  Check it out! Extra lives!
Finn|  You still have two left!
Jake|   Ow! It burns! Ow! Haha!
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|  
Finn|  Dude! What if losing all your lives in here makes you die in real life? Or worse?!
Jake|  ...that makes me just want to sit here and feel bad.
Finn|  No way, man! We're gonna cross that hole! With real-world grit! Come on!
Finn|  Faster, Jake! Get ready to stretch it!
Finn|  Watch out, Jake! 
Jake|  Ow! Whew! That was pretty intense, dude!
Finn|  We're pretty intense dudes!
Jake|  Yeah! 
Finn|  Ha!
Jake|  What's that sound?
Finn|  Sounds like... 
Finn and Jake|  Bouncy Bee!
Jake|  Whoa!
Finn|  Hi-yah!  Oh! 
Finn|  You ready to flippin' this guy up, Jake?
Jake|  Easy-peasy, livin' greasy!
Jake|  No! 
Jake|  Finn's dead! Finn! No!  Why?  NO!!! Curse this false virtual world!  Oh, Finn!
Finn|  Yo, what up?
Jake|  Oh, Finn! You're alive! 
Finn|  Yeah. I got extra lives, man!
Jake|  Oh my gosh. Let's never die again! There's nothing more precious than a life! Ooh, dude, look. Coins! Oh man, oh man!  Heeheehee!  Ooh! Oh, man, dude, these coins are thick! Let's take 'em back to the real world! We'll be filthy stinkin' rich!
Finn|  Whoa!
Finn and Jake|  Hunny Bunny!
Jake|  No!
Finn|  Time to use the bomba!  Come to me, bomba.  Bomba!  Oh, bomba! I can't select you without my controller!
Jake|  Let's get outta here, Finn!
Finn|  Man, we've never run away from Hunny Bunny!
Finn|  Firepit, Bouncy Bee, Hunny Bunny. They're supposed to be the easy parts! They're all hard as butts! Sleepy Sam is gonna be the ultimate butt-kicker!
Jake|  Look, Finn. The most important thing to remember is that I still have one giant coin.
Finn|  Man, get a hold of your brains! We need to stay alert for Sleepy Sam!
Jake|  Hey, that's him right there! 
Finn|  Get down!  What's he doing? He's probably trying to psych me out!  I'm gonna break you, Sam. When I'm done, they'll call you...uh, Stinky Sam. Stupid Frog.
Finn|   M-m-my mitts didn't- didn't work! Come on, help me punch him!
Jake|  Okay!
Jake|  Let's get outta here, man! We're gonna die!
Finn|  I can see the light! We're almost there!
Finn|  Oh no, man. It's the edge of the screen! We're trapped and they'll be here any second.
Jake|  Wait, dude! The bomba!
Finn|  We can't get the bomba!
Jake|  Wait, dude.  Hmm.
Finn|  Jake? Jake!
Jake|  What if I...? 
Finn|  That's not how it works!
Finn|  Jake, let go of that!
Jake|   But we need the bomba!
Jake|  Finn!
Finn|  Oh, holy cow! That was nuts, man!
Jake|  Yeah, man. And I got my coin!  What?! A penny?!  BMO!  Oh no! Are you alright buddy?
BMO|   Did you have to- oh no! Wait! Run!
Finn|  No, no, no! Don't kill us, man! No!
Jake|  Aw man, don't kill us! We don't have extra lives!
Sleepy Sam|  Oh wait. Hold up, guys. Check it out! Sunshine!
Sleepy Sam|  Oh boy, that feels good!
Hunny Bunny|  Alright! See ya later, Sam! 
Finn|   You mean, that's it? You're not gonna kill us?
Sleepy Sam|   Of course not. The game's over; we won! All we wanted was the sunshine. And to kill that computer that's been imprisoning us for so many years.
Finn|  ...what?
BMO|  Help! Oh no!
Finn and Jake|  BMO!
Sleepy Sam|  Oh sure. He's dangerous! If he hits his button again, back we go.
Finn|  BMO, quick! Hit your button!
BMO|  I can't, Finn! I'm stuck!
Sleepy Sam|  You want him to hit his button? What's wrong with you?!
Jake|  We'll save you, BMO! Finn, go!
BMO|  They're too strong! Use the combo move, Finn! The combo- 
Finn|  The combo move? That never works!
Jake|  Listen! You got this, man! I know you-  I know you can do it, buddy! You got this! 
Finn|   Okay, okay. You got this, Finn! For your friends!  Up! Down! Left! Left! Right! Right! Down! Spin! Down! Up! Left! Right! Left! Down! Spin! Up! Down! Jump!!
Finn|  Whoa.
Jake|  Woohoo!  You did it, Finn! I knew you had the stuff! Right, BMO?
Finn|  Oh, crud!
Jake|  BMO!
Finn|  I'm sorry, buddy!
BMO|  Finn, I told you about the danger! And now look! You fricasseed my stuff and broke our house all up!
Finn|  I know, I know. I was double butt. For real.  Man! Now that we know what to expect, next time will be way more fun!
Jake|  Yeah, yeah!
Finn|  How 'bout it, BMO? You in?
BMO|  
Finn|  Hey! Don't do the combo move on us!
Jake|  We were only joking!
Finn|  BMO! Stop messing around!
Jake|   Finn, oh my grosh, Finn! It was amazing!
Finn|  Whaaaa?
Jake|  I had a croak dream, Finn! My croak dream!
Finn|  Oh... my glob.
Jake|  
Finn|  For real? With the Cosmic Owl and everything?
Jake|  Mhmm!
Finn|  Whoa, a real croak dream?
Jake|  Yeah man!  There was a rocket ship , you weren't there , and there was a Banana Man  and I ran out of air and in outer space  and isn't that great Finn!
Finn|  Yeah, well no I mean, I don't want you to die! And where was I? I'm your best friend!
Jake|  Aww, come on Finn  There's nothing to worry about! Think about it, I don't know any Banana Man Finn and rocket ships haven't been reinvented yet! I'll probably live another hundred years, easy.
Finn|  Ummm... Yeah, yeah I guess. .
Jake|  Someones downstairs.
Finn|  I'll take a look. 
Jake|  Who is it?
Finn|  It's the Banana Man!
Jake|  
Finn|  Shhh!
Jake|   What do we do?
Finn|   I don't know!
Jake|   Is he still out there?
Finn|   Uhh no, he left. 
Jake|  Phew, see I told you today wasn't the day! Hey, you wanna make an ice cream pizza?
Finn|  Jake, your croak dream just gave us the upper hand, we can cheat now, now we can cheat fate.
Finn|  We'll track down that Banana Man and crunk up his schemes and save you!
Jake|  Finn,  when I die my individual earth conscious is gonna go all everywhere while glob tallies my deeds!
Finn|  What?
Jake|  I'm gonna be all around you!  In your nose, in your dreams and socks, I'll be a part of you in your earth mind!  It's gonna be great!
Finn|  Dude, STOP. SAYING. ALL THIS. CRAZY. NONSENSE. It's makin' me messed up. I'm 13. You're messin' me up.
Jake|  No one can change your croak dream, Finn, not even you.
Finn|  We'll see about that, come on!  Wait, just let him walk a few more steps.
Jake|  Why?
Finn|  'Cause that idiot's about to walk right into the sun and burn up. And we'll be done with him.
Jake|  No man, he's walking into his house! .
Finn|  Oh, what?! He built his house on the sun?! This guy's insane!
Jake|  Finn, did you eat your breakfast?
Finn|  No, why?
Jake|  Because you forgot how the sun works. The sun is actually far away, it's not just sitting on the horizon. 
Finn|  Oh. Right on. Lets chase after him!
Jake|  You gotta eat your breakfast man, eat the protein. Helps your brain.
Finn|  Yeah, yeah whatever you say, Mom. Lets go!  C'mon!  What's he doin' with that glass? 
Jake|  Whoa, just like in my dream! 
Banana Man|  Huh? Hmmm.   Uh, Uh, Uh, Yeah! There we go!
Finn|  Jake! Stop talkin' about your croak dream. It makes me uncomfortable. 
Jake|  Dude, just except it!
Finn|  No dude!
Jake|  What are you doing man?  Ahh!!
Finn|  Hand me some leaves and twigs and stuff.  Hmmm. 
Jake|  Ahh!
Jake|  Wait, you're not gonna kill him, are you?!
Finn|  Naw, man.  It's just a warning shot to scare him in to moving far away from here. 
Finn & Jake|  Ahh! 
Banana Man|   Hmmm?  Ha Ha! Look Out! Woo Hoo!  Ha ha! You Hoo!  Hoo! Yeah! Woo! Do it! Yeah! Oh yeah! Woo!  Yeah!  Move it!  Work it! Ha ha!
Finn|  I'm gonna try to shoot this arrow again.
Jake|  Careful man, I want to be alive for my croak!
Banana Man|  There we go! 
Finn & Jake|  Whoa! 
Finn|  Don't worry, Jake, were gonna get this guy.
Jake|  Dude, man. I appreciate why you're doing this, but you're not gonna stop me from transcend in to Glob world!
Finn|  I'm gonna cry, man. If you say that one more time, I'm gonna... Let's go fetch that first arrow to reuse, 'cause we're out of arrows. 
Jake|  Huh? 
Finn|  No!
Jake|  The rocket from my croak dream! Oh, man. I guess... I guess this is it. I've gotta embrace this today!
Finn|  Shushers, you're not getting on that rocket!  Err!  JAKE! 
Jake|  You can't stop destiny, Finn! 
Finn|  Jake, no! 
Jake|  Huh? No, man! 
Banana Man|  Huh?  What in the--  No, no, no! It's not ready yet! 
Jake|  Yeyuh!
Finn|   Aww!  Nooo! 
Jake|  Banana Man! Get your butt on board, we've got a date with destiny!
Finn|  No! 
Jake|  Get off! You cant mess with fate!
Finn|  No! I'm not gonna let you die!
Jake|  Finn!
Finn|  Don't do this!
Jake|  Finn.
Finn|  No!
Jake|  Finn, let me go.
Finn|   Please.  Please.
Jake|  You have to let me go.
Finn|  No.  Please.
Jake|  DESTINY! 
Banana Man|  There's not enough boom boom sticks in the stick hole! No!
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|  Take care, brother. You weren't by my side in the croak dream but I'm glad you're here to see me off
Finn|  That's right! I wasn't in his dream! That means...
Jake|  See you on the other side! 
Banana Man|  Ahh! 
Jake|  Huh? Whaaa?
Jake|  Am I in glob world?
Jake & Banana Man|  Ahhh!
Finn|  Jake! Jake!!  Jake I'm coming with you! 
Banana Man|  Ahh!
Jake|  Fiiiiiiinnn, don't try to stop me, Finn!
Finn|  No, it's okay, I'm here to stay by your side! 
Jake|  Thanks man, I knew you'd come around.
Finn|  
Jake|  Take it easy there, buddy.
Banana Man|   I just wanted to borrow some sugar!! 
Jake|  Poor Banana Man. So I guess that wasn't a real croak dream after all! It didn't really come together quite right.
Finn|  Heh, heh yeah.
Jake|  Hey no wait, in the croak dream it was me and Banana Man,  but this time you were here too.  So...  it must be destined to happen again when your not around!
Finn|  Well in that case, I'll just have to never leave your side ever again for the rest of our lives.
Jake|  Hmm?  What are you doing?
Finn|   I can never leave your side ever again for the rest of our lives.
Jake|   Get off of me!
Finn|   For the rest of our lives! 
Jake|  No!
Finn|  I know where you live!
Jake|  No, c'mon!
Finn|  Ooh! Ooh!
Jake|  I know you're not a ghost, Finn! Stop chasing me!
Banana Man|   Aoo hoo! Ha ha!  Uh huh!  Ha ha!  Yeah! 
Neptr| BMO, when is something going to happen?
BMO| Shh. Just watch. It happens once a month—I promise.
BMO|  This is it!
Neptr| Oooooh.
Neptr| But where does it go?
BMO| That's none of our business.
Bug| Tickets! Get your tickets here! See the world's greatest tiny circus! Witness the amazing wood-eating termite! The mighty strong-ant!
Ringmaster| You're late, Blue Nose! Get into makeup!
Male audience member| You stink!
Ringmaster|  Too much artsy, not enough fartsy. We talked about this, clown!  Heh-heh, wasn't that something? Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, you're perfectly safe. But at this time, I'd like to ask anyone with a medical condition to please leave the premises at once. What you're about to witness with your own eyes may shock and astound you to your very core.
Ringmaster| Tonight, I give you the wildest, most dangerous beast anywhere in captivity! The horrible, the stupendous...  Goralina!
Ringmaster|   Attagirl!
Dad bug|  Don't worry, Junior. It's all part of the act.
Ringmaster| Blue Nose! Boy, am I glad to see you. Come in, come in! Sit down. You did good out there tonight with the belly-dancing routine. Real good. Aw, don't give me that look. I know we said we were going to let the chipmunk go at the end of last season, but Goralina is our big draw. You understand that.
Ringmaster| We're barely breaking even here—what do you want from me?! Look, there's another show in an hour. You come up with an act that can rival Goralina, then we can talk. But look what she got us last night three whole pennies. Think you can make me this kind of cash? You do that, I won't need the chipmunk anymore. I'll let her go, just like I promised. But you're gonna have to lose the fancy-schmancy stuff and  give the people what they want! Get it?!
Ringmaster|  The old Blue Nose magic.
Dad bug|  Aren't you glad we came back for the second show?
Audience|  
Ringmaster| Oho! You were great, kid! That's what I'm talking about. With you and the chipmunk in the show, we're gonna have a real one-two punch!
Ringmaster| Hey... I know what I said, but I want to see how many boxcars this gravy train has on it.
Ringmaster| Look at her. It's like looking at a big, sad dollar sign.
Ringmaster| Yipe!
Ringmaster| Whoa-ho!
Strongman|   Oh!
Ringmaster| That's right. Lift with your legs first, then put your back into it.
Ringmaster| There he is. Gotcha! Thought you could skip out, eh? and start your own circus!
Strongman| Yeah, you! You and your corny clown hat! 
Other performer| Hey, he's smiling! 
Strongman|  What's so funny?
Other performer| You rat! 
Strongman|  You creep! What's the big joke?
Neptr| Ha ha! Neat!
Candy Child| “Mom, I wanna play outside with consuelo!” “Cool your jets! It’s super dangerous outside. Little kids have to stay in the castle.” “But I’m rowdy.”
Candy Child| “Yeah, well, but look.”
Candy Child| “See what happens? You want a playdate with death? That’s why you have to stay inside. And, cause consuelo’s mom is a pain in the neck. I-”
Chocoberry| In the heat of the sun you burn like a pink little baby!
Candy Child| Help!
Mr. Cupcake| What?
Chocoberry| Oh, a scream!
Candy Child| Help!
Mr. Cupcake| Well, now, what seems to be the trouble?
Candy Child| I saw something in the water, and I was like, “No thanks!”
Candy Child| Out of my way, muffin man!
Mr. Cupcake| How rude! Well, whatever that little girl saw will be a mystery forever.
Human Transport Ship| Transport for seeker X-J-77 Strong has arrived.
Mr. Cupcake| Oh, trust me, I’m strong indeed. Pow, pow!

Human Transport Ship| Verifying.
Mr. Cupcake| Woah! Well, hello frisky!
Chocoberry| Todd! I’m right here!
Human Transport Ship| Identifying. Dangerous mutant. Initiating defensive mode.
Human Transport Ship| Seeking human.
Human Transport Ship| Human. Come home to safety. Seeking human.
Human Transport Ship| Human. Come home to safety.
Finn| Hey, Jake, what about this one?
Jake| Great. We’re gonna look so great for this funeral.
BMO| How do you like my bandeau? I was too embarrassed to get a bra fitting. I know they are professionals, but it’s just too intimate.
Jake| You look great!
Human Transport Ship| Settlement detected. Continuing search for X-J-77.
Banana Guard| Get him! Attack! Attack!
Human Transport Ship| Hostile cylinders detected. Release countermeasures.
Human Transport Ship| Hostile cylinders immobilized.
Human Transport Ship| Engaging hostile bobbleheads.
Human Transport Ship| Neutralizing. Please do not turn your system off during neutralization.
Finn| Holy mud! It took out the Gumball Guards like they was nothin’!
BMO| BMO doesn’t like it!
Jake| We gotta chop this thing into smashaghetti.
Finn| I’ll take you out with these hug nubs!
Banana Guard| Ah! I’ll help you, Finn!
Banana Guard| Ah! Help me, Finn!
Human Transport Ship| Hostile mutant neutralized.
Finn|  You got this, Finn Mertens. You’re a buff little bionic baby.  Rush! Rush!
Finn| Rush!

Human Transport Ship| PG-8-7.
Finn| Uh… You mean me?
Human Transport Ship| You will assist this transport in locating seeker X-J-77.
Human Transport Ship| PG-8-7 Mertens, please climb aboard. Please climb aboard. Come on.
Finn| Mertens? Wait, do you, like, know me?
Jake| Got it! Great work distracting ‘em, Finn.
Jake| You okay, dude?
Finn| I feel like that ship might’ve been important, but I’m fine.
Jake| Yeah, my hands are a little sore from smashing, but I’m fine too.
BMO| Hiyah!
BMO| Ha ha! Once again, BMO comes out on top.
Jake| BMO!
Finn| BMO, you okay?
BMO| Signal received. XJ-7-7 requests transport.
Finn| Hey.
Susan| Hi, Finn.
Finn| Uh, sorry again my grass arm busted you up.
Susan| It’s okay. At the time, Susan was gonna bust you up. Where’s Jake? Is he okay?
Finn| He’s outside. He’s bringing the ship over.
Susan| The ship?
Susan| Oh, ship.
Princess Bubblegum| How ‘bout it, Suze? Does any of this look familiar?
Jake| Me and Finn took this whole bad block down ourselves! Took a bit of fananglin’, but I never hunt what I can’t catch.
Princess Bubblegum| Hey. Looking for this?
Princess Bubblegum| I’ve been holding onto the remnants of your cranial implant since you kidnapped Finn and almost killed Jake. You remember that? I’m running a comparative mass spec test now.
Princess Bubblegum| Yep. Looks like both your implant and the ship have the same technological origin. Human technology.
BMO| Finished!
Princess Bubblegum| Looks like BMO’s finally downloaded the ship’s last commands.
BMO| Signal received. Proceed to extraction point. Return seeker XJ-7-7 and cargo to Founders Island, Home.
Princess Bubblegum| BMO, can you give us printouts?
BMO| Yes, okay. Printing.
Princess Bubblegum| Hmm. Man, this island’s way far out there.
Susan| Susan needs to go back here. To this island. Not sure why. Susan having crazy week.
Princess Bubblegum| I don’t know, Susan. It’s so far. Even I don’t know what’s out there. It’s a pretty risky solo mission.
Finn| I’m going too. I mean, we gotta find out where this ship came from. There could be more of them. And, if this is human-made, then there might be other humans on that island. That’d be cool to see, right?
Jake| I’ll come too!
BMO| And so will we!
Princess Bubblegum| No, we won’t.
BMO| Oh.
Princess Bubblegum| Well, it sounds like you’re all determined. You should borrow my boat, though. This thing is trashed.
Jake| We don’t need a boat! Have you forgotten? With a little imagination…
Jake| ...I can be anything that you could ever...
Jake| ...Oh, I lost focus. Hey, yeah, can we borrow your boat?
Finn| Are you up here, Fern?
Fern| Hey. Thanks for letting me crash on the roof.
Fern| It’s nice up here.
Finn| Stay as long as you want. I came up here to ask a favor. I might be gone for a while on this trip, see, and I need someone to, uh, cover for me here in Ooo.
Fern| Are you sure? I mean, hero biz is your whole thing. And, whatever I am, I’m not you.
Finn| You can just do your own thing with it. Like, if some huge gross monster’s gonna do murder on a buncha innocents, uh, kill it! But kill it you-styles. Just don’t go nuts.
Fern| Okay, I can handle that.
Fern| Thanks for trusting me.
Finn| No, thank you, Fern. I better go pack.
Fern| Uh… We should figure out a better thing.
Finn| Let’s figure out something better.
Charlie| Hey… Dad.
Jake| Charlie, hi. It’s me! It’s dad.
Jake| I have to go on a sea voyage, honey. I wanted to say bye.
Charlie| That’s cool. Hey, you can’t see this shirt, right? This shirt has like, four different breakfasts on it.
Jake| I can’t hear anything. Bye, love you! Mwah!
Charlie| Mkay, dad. I’ll tell the other pups.
Jake| And, I’m telling the other pups!
Jake| Aw, I’m gonna miss you so much, lady.
Lady Rainicorn| 아우 너무 걱정하지 말고 그냥 가서 좋은 형님 노릇하고와. 그리고 올때 기념품이나 사오고. 
Jake| Finn, did you bring your nail clippers?
Finn| Uh, I think so.
Jake| Cool, I forgot too.
Finn| Bye, treehouse!
Neptr| Goodbye, creator!
Neptr| Now me and BMO can really cut loose.
Neptr| Look, BMO! I am pretending to trash a hotel room.
Neptr| BMO?
BMO| Ouch.
Finn| Thanks for seeing us off, guys.
Princess Bubblegum| Yeah, of course. It’s my boat.
Marceline| And we care about him, you dingus! Come on! Sorry, Marcy is up past her bedtime.
Princess Bubblegum| No, it’s true.
Princess Bubblegum| I want you to be really careful out there.
Finn| Don’t worry. We’ve got Susan.
Princess Bubblegum| That’s not what I mean. Finn, I get the sense that this trip’s more important to you than you’re letting on. I mean, if you make it to that island, you might find out some pretty heavy stuff. About the humans and where you came from. About yourself. All I’m saying is, you have to promise me, promise me, that you’ll come home safe.
Finn| I-
Fern| Hi Bonnie!
Finn and Princess Bubblegum| Ah!
Fern| I’m Fern. I kind of already know you.
Fern| I have a lot of fuzzy half-memories from when I was this guy.
Finn| Well, just keep the ones where she’s our boss, and forget everything else.
Susan| Finn?
Marceline| Hey! Good morning.
Susan| Boat’s loaded, ready to go.
Fern| Ah! I flinched.
Finn| It’s cool.
Finn| We’ll be back soon, I promise!
Jake| Bye, kids! Don’t be naughty.
Princess Bubblegum| Bye! Good luck! He’ll be safe.
Marceline|  Hey, aren’t you that dude that totaled Starchy’s motorcycle?
Princess Bubblegum|   Ah fudge! What time is it? I gotta go to Veggie Village for the Annual Technology Fair. Will y’all watch my Princess Plant for me?  I usually hire a sitter but- Ehn!
Finn|  Of course, Princess!
Princess Bubblegum|  Awesome! Thank you, Finn. I will be back on the Morrow. SCREEEEEEEE!
Finn|  You’re in good hands, Princess Plant.
Finn|  And then the monster got punched in the head and the princess was safe. And everyone was happy!
Finn|  
Finn|  Time to lay down beautiful buddy.
Jake|  Yeah. Time to make sleepies!
Finn|  Ahhh. We killed it, man!
Jake|  I know!
Finn|  Okay.  All we gotta do, is go to the Land of the Dead and reclaim the flower’s soul from death before Bubblegum returns.
Jake|  Okay!
Peppermint Butler|  Excuse me, but did you all say Land of the Dead?
Finn|  Oh, what?! Oh, uh… yeah.
Peppermint Butler|  I can take you.
Finn|  Really?
Peppermint Butler|  Certainly, Finn.  For a small price. Which we can discuss later! Take my hands, gentlemen! 
Peppermint Butler|  Stare into where the two walls meet. Now slowly, cross your eyes.  Do it, fools!
Peppermint Butler|  The portal opens!
Peppermint Butler|  Say ‘hi’ to Death for me if you see him! He lives in a castle made of light!
Jake|  Uh… okay.
Finn|  Thanks Peppermint Butler. 
Peppermint Butler|  And don’t drink the-  water.
Jake|  Whoa man, who knew Peppermint Butler was so- 
Jake|  So… um… you wanna…  hop in my paunch and I’ll stretch us down?
Finn|  Uh… Oh look, an escalator!
Finn|   Hey, dude.
Finn|  That must be the main entrance or some biz!
Jake|  Let’s go!
Finn|  Holy schmow!
Gate Guardian|   Welcome to the Underworld. Cause of death?
Spear Skeleton|  Uh… Spear in the neck.
Gate Guardian|  You may enter.
Spear Skeleton|  Yay! 
Gate Guardian|  How did you die?
Finn|  Uh…
Finn and Jake|   Because we’re awesome!  Whoo! Ha ha! Ha ha!
Gate Guardian|  Hmm… Step out of line. 
Finn|  Awh dingle!
Jake|  Wait up, dude! Follow me, and do as I do. 
Gate Guardian|   Hey! I said no!
Gate Guardian|  Hey! Hey!!
Jake|  Ha ha, we’re in! Come on, man!
Gate Guardian|   Man…
Finn|  Yes!
Jake|  Yes!
Finn|  Where do we go now, dude?
Jake|   Up there!
Finn & Jake|  Oooooo!
Jake|  Death’s castle is pretty, dude.
Finn|  Let’s go! 
Skeleton Guy|  Hey! What’s up, fellas! Hi. Lester.  Oh man, flesh! Haven’t seen this stuff in forever!  So warm and gushy and softy!  Look at all that flesh jigglin'!
Jake|  Hey! If you love flesh so much, then watch this! 
Lester|  Whoo! You don’t know what you’re doing to me, guy! Fellas get over here! Flesh!
Finn|   This is weird, man.
Jake|  Don’t worry! They just think we’re cool!
Finn|  Hmm… Do you guys think we’re cool?
Lester|  No. We’re gonna rip that flesh off you! And eat it!
Finn|  It’s bone-kicking time! 
Skeleton|  
Finn|  Oh shoot! Get- 
Finn|  Jake! There’s too many!
Jake|   They’re tryin’ to peel me!  I… am not… a banana!  Hole! 
Finn|  It’s not a hole, Jake! It’s just a divot!
Jake|  Sorry! 
Finn|  Dude, shrink down!
Jake|  Oh! Sorry.
Finn|  I don’t like the underworld too much.
Jake|  I don’t know. Wouldn’t be so bad if there weren’t folks trying to eat our skin.
Finn|  I wonder how Princess Bubblegum is doing.
Princess Bubblgum|  So! Who here invented this thing?
Finn|  I’m glad she’s not coming back ‘till tomorrow.
Jake|"  No she said she’s coming back ""on the Morrow."""
Finn|  Yeah, on the ‘morrow. That means tomorrow.
Jake|  No man, the Morrow is her bird!
Finn|  Come again?
Jake|  It’s her bird! That thing is crazy fast! It’ll only take like twenty minutes to get back once that conference is over.  Are you listening, man?  The Morrow, is a bird. 
Finn|  We gotta go!  Coast is clear!
Skeleton|  Halt!  Hey!  Hey Halt! Why you got your eyes closed, Halt?
Halt|  I’m trying to picture in my mind’s eye where the fleshies are hiding.
Skeleton|  Ooh! You’re a smart guy, Halt!
Finn|   Wait, Jake! Do you hear somethin’? Come on! 
Group of Skeletons|   I didn’t see them… They were here, and now they’re gone!...
Finn|  More skeletons! We’ve gotta be really, really quiet!
Skeleton|  Get em!
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|  I thought it would be funny!
Finn & Jake|  Ahh!
Finn|   Look! There’s Death’s castle!
Finn|   I don’t see anyone. I guess you double-killed them with that avalanche.
Jake|  Heh, awesome!
Finn|  Now we just gotta cross that river!
Jake|  River!  Man, I’m so thirsty! My mouth’s still all dusty!
SkulL| Yes…  Drink the water…
Finn|  Whoa, okay Jake, don’t drink the water!
Jake|  Come one! I’m so thirsty!
Finn|  Dude! That skull wants you to drink the water! It’s bad water!
Skull|  Don’t drink the water!
Jake|  See? That means good right? 
Finn|  Jake…
Finn|  Jake? Why you makin’ stupid face?
Jake|  Who’s Jake?
Finn|  Dang it, I knew that water was junk!
Skull| Tricked again by the River of Forgetfulness!
Finn|  Jake! Get out of that water right now!
Jake|  Hey! I don’t know who you are, mister, but I don’t like your attitude!
Jake|  Help! Somebody!
Princess Bubblegum|  Farewell, everyone!  Okay… Morrow! Back to the Candy Kingdom!
Jake|  Help! Somebody help me! Stranger danger!
Death|  Hey! Hey! I see you!
Finn|  Jake! Your head!
Jake|   Huh?  Who are you?
Death|  Who are you?
Jake|  I don’t know, man! Who are you?
Death|  What do you mean? You’re in my castle! 
Jake|  Well, I didn’t know!
Finn|  Dang it, Jake.
Death|  You must leave this place. Now!
Finn|   Death! We’re not leaving until our plant’s soul! And Jake’s memory!
Death|  Another one. Be gone, mortal!
Finn|  No! I promised Princess Bubblegum!  Oof! Oww… What happened?
Death|  You can’t kick me because your brain is stupid!
Finn|  Your brain is stupid!
Jake|  Hehehehehehe, this kid’s pretty funny!
Death|   Alright.  Pick an instrument.
Finn|  Huh?
Death|   To get stuff from me, you have to beat me in a musical battle.
Finn|  But Jake’s the musical one! And he’s got poo brain!
Death|   I don’t care.
Finn|  I gotta find what I can really play! Oh glob, man!  Oh! Here we go!  Sleigh bells! YA WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW!
Death|  So the contest begins!
Death|   Hey, alright, so... who do you think won?
Jake|"  Oh, man! Skeleton guy by a landslide! He was like ""Rughhh,"" he was like ."
Finn|  Dude!
Jake|  What? Skeleton guy was awesome! You want me to lie?
Finn|  Yes! 
Death|  I’m going to kill you now.
Finn|  No! I still have to rescue stuff!
Death|   Those are the rules in the Land of the Dead. Lose a music battle, lose your life. 
Finn|  Oh wait, wait, wait! Before I die, I’m honor-bound to tell you... Peppermint Butler says hi.
Death|   What? You know Peppermint Butler?!
Finn|  Yeah!
Death|  Heh heh heh! Yo, you guys can have whatever you want!  Jake, stand up!
Jake|  That’s me, right? 
Death|  Yes. 
Jake|  What’re you doin’?
Jake|  What’re you doing?!
Death|  Kiss of death, baby. You got your memory back.
Jake|  Awh, gross! I wish I didn’t!
Death|  Now I shall return the soul of this. 
Finn & Jake|  Yeah! The Princess Plant!
Death|  I'll see you dudes later.  
Princess Bubblegum|  Hello, boys. Where’s my plant?
Peppermint Butler|  Hello, Princess!
Princess Bubblegum| Yay!  Thank you all for taking such good care of my plant! Now come here and give me a hug!
Finn & Jake|  Yay, hugs!
Peppermint Butler|   Ahem. Mr. Finn, Mr. Jake, I believe you still owe me something in exchange for that favor I did.
Finn|  Sure!
Jake|  Yeah, what is it?
Peppermint Butler|  I’d like your flesh.
Jake|  Quit bein’ silly, Peppermint Butler!
Peppermint Butler|   I’m going to take it from you while you sleep.
Finn|  Do you think it's right for Marceline to invite us to jam without Princess and BMO?
Jake|  It's just a jam sesh. Is that what you're gonna jam with?
Finn|  Yeah, man. Balloon music is the future. Listen. 
Jake|  Pretty good.  I don't think you mastered it yet.
Finn|  Well, duh. I just started.
Jake|  Oh, dude. There's a note.
Finn|  What's it say?
Jake|"   ""Hey, guys, I had to run out, but I'll be back,"" blee-bloo-blop, ""Don't go in my house."""
Finn|  That's it?
Jake|"  Yeah. Just ""Don't go in my house"" in all caps... written in blood."
Finn|  Hmm.  What are you doing?
Jake|  Eliminating desire from my heart. It helps pass the time.
Finn|  Come on! I can't do that! Let's play Cloud Hunt 'til she gets here.
Jake|  No, man, I got a mental block with Cloud Hunt!
Finn|  Yeah, that's what makes it awesome, 'cause I know I'll win.
Jake|  Oh, what?! Bring it on, brother! Now explain the rules 'cause I forget.
Finn|  Okay. I count to ten and you go hide somewhere. Then, I gotta try to find you. You can hide... anywhere in here. Anywhere in here, ...but Marcy's house is off limits because she said so. Okay?
Jake|  Got it.
Finn|  Okay. I'm gonna start counting. Ready?
Jake|   Yes.
Finn|  Go! One...  Two... Three... Four... Five... Four...
Finn|  Cloud Hunt... GOTCHA! Huh. Hmm.  AH-HA!  JAKE!  Get out of there! Marceline's gonna kill you! Jake! I know this isn't a mirror. What the—?! You're doing it wrong, even! Get out! Get out!!  Dude, get out of there! She's gonna kill us! She'll be home any minute! Did you read the note?! I mean, you read the note! You told it to me!! 
Marceline|   Smells like sourdough in here.
Jake|  She's gonna kill us. Once she finds out she's gonna tie us up and eat us like a spider.
Finn|  You don't think I know that?! Hmmmmmmm... We'll wait for the right moment and sneak out... right under her big, fat caboose.
Jake|  Okay, man. I can do this.  Egh! Egh! Egh!!
Finn|  Shh, here she comes!
Jake|  Here she comes...
Finn|  Shh, shh!!
Marceline|  Huh.
Jake|  Let's get outta here.
Marceline|  Hello?
Jake|  She didn't wash hands!
Marceline|  Is someone here?
Finn|   Shh!!
Marceline| That's what stinks.  Where are those dweebs? 
Finn|  This is Jake!
Jake|  And this is Finn!
Finn & Jake|  We're not home right now, so...  ...leave a message!  quiet down.] Leave a message! 
Marceline|  Uh... Yeah, hey, you guys. Are you still coming over? It's jam time, so, like, call me, 'kay?
Jake|  Whatcha doin'?
Finn|"   Get down.  Love, FINN + JAKE""] When she gets this, she'll leave and we can escape!"
Jake|  Brilliant... but how's it gonna work?
Finn|  I'll fly the paper as an airplane down the bedroom ladder. It'll triple barrel roll past the kitchen, open the fridge, and cook some eggs, then eat the eggs, and unfold itself as it lays in the carpet in front of Marceline's door!
Jake|  Yeah, yeah, awesome, yeah!!
Jake|  No, nah, nuts!
Marceline|  Welp... they're not gonna show up, then I'll just work on my own stuff, I guess.  Take one for new concept album based on five hundred years of my journal entries. So here's some preliminary notes.  I... I wanna make this the most emotional album ever. So private and secret, that I'll never let anyone hear.
Jake|   This is so wrong.
Marceline|  No one can ever hear it. Ever. Take one.
Jake|   We've crossed the line! I'm gettin' outta here, man!
Finn|  Yeah! Do it!
Finn|  What? What's it doing?!
Finn & Jake|  Shh, shh, shh!!
Marceline|  Oh, what?! What happened?! Ugh!  Where are you?! Oh, there you are... My broom.
Marceline|    Stupid... thing— Get...  NO! Stupid—  UGH!!   Ugh!
Finn|  Is it safe?
Jake|  I dunno, man. Go scope the scene.
Jake|  What happened, man?
Finn|   I'm not goin' back out there.
Jake|  Well... whaddaya mean? What happened?  Bro?
Finn|  Is she awake?
Jake|  Why are you talking?!
Finn|  I'm wondering if she's awake.
Jake|  Well, if she's awake, she can definitely hear you talking!
Finn|  I'm whispering.
Jake|  Well, now we're both quietly screaming.
Marceline|   I can hear both of you.
Finn|  Disguise yourself, fool!
Marceline|  What're you bozos doing in my lair?
Jake|  Dude, I think she sees us!
Finn|  What the—?! DUDE! You shape-changed to look like me?! 
Jake|  Well, yeah!
Marceline|  HEY!  Exssssplain yourselves.
Finn|   We were playing hide-and-seek in your closet and you came home, so we hid in there all day. We saw... everything. And, oh, Glob, I mean, whatever you do to us, I just wanna say, we're sorry.
Jake|  So sorry.
Marceline|   Okay... apology accepted.
Jake|  What?!
Marceline|  I hide in your house all the time.
Marceline|  Anyways, no hard feelings, guys! See you soon!
Finn|  Marceline?  Jake! Jake!
Jake|  Hmm?  Hey, man, did—
Finn|  AAAAAAH!!
Jake|  AAAAAAH!!
Finn| And when that salsa cloud had you by the tail...?
Jake| Ha ha, yeah. And I swung him around into that golden cactus?
Finn|  Man, that was algebraic.
Jake| Yeah, man, that adventure was tight.
Finn| Yeah.
Jake| I can't wait to get back home, though.
Finn| Yeah, me, too!
Jake| I need some sleep—
Finn| I'm gonna play some Battle Wars with Neptr on BMO for an hour, then work on that flier for PB's laser recital and catch up on my correspondence with my pen pal Danny Gladiolas from over in Maryville.
Jake|  Great minds. 
Finn| And then next what I'm gonna do is I'm— whoop! 
Jake| Finn?  Finn!  Ohh!  Oh...
Finn| What the...?
Finn| Man, where's this supposed to be?
Finn| Uh, excuse me? Sir?
Huge King| Hmm? Oh! You're awake! Oh, that's wonderful!
Finn| Oh, thanks. Hey, where am I, anyway?
Huge King| Why, this is the famed Kingdom of Huge, of course. Heh. You fell through that crack in my ceiling and landed in a normal-sized pie.
Finn| Mm-hmm. Well, my friend up top is probs pretty worried about me, so I'd best get going. Can you give me a boost back up to that crack or whatever?
Huge King| Oh-ho-ho! No, no, no. Don't be silly, child. Your friend must be on his way to find you right now. You should wait for him here, or you could miss each other.
Finn| Hmm. I guess that does make sense.
Huge King| Of course! Besides, you're just in time to witness the chiming of my wondrous clock! It's set to do its chiming in merely an hour's time!
Finn|"  ""Krimber""?"
Huge King| Come! Food boys! Shower our guest with the kindnesses of Huge! We will await the clock's chiming in style and comfort.
Huge King| Dig in, child! There's always more to come!
Finn| Mmm. Oh! Apple scruffs!
Huge King| Just wait 'till you see my clock!
Bear| Ahh, good, you're awake.  Good good good good good. How you feelin'?
Jake| Ohh...  My--my cabbage aches a little... What happened?
Bear|  Well, here I was, playing some Freecell, and then, wow! You fell down the hole, bounced off parachute #2, and landed on three ol' walnuts.
Jake| Parachute? Hole? Walnuts? Fell down, wait!  You mean we're falling right now?  Thanks for your help, buddy, but I gotta go.
Bear|  Woah, hold up!  What's your hurry?
Jake| My friend's still up top. He could be looking for me. Or, he could be in trouble and every second I'm down here I'm falling further away. I gotta get back.
Bear| Uhhh, I think that's a pretty bad idea. You were unconscious while you were falling, remember? So you mighta been falling for weeks, or even months.  Trust me, it's possible. This is a very deep hole. If you try to climb out, you could run out of food.
Jake| But, I've got to do something.
Bear| I feel like you should probably not starve to death, so that when your friend comes looking, you're still alive.
Jake| Mmm. You know I think you're right!  Finn is a pretty heroic kid, I gotta admit. He'll probably be here in half a gif.
Bear| Oh, good, good. Well 'till then, please, make yourself at home. Here,  have a walnut.
Jake|  Thanks, man. I'm Jake, by the way.
Seven| Hi, Jake. I'm Seven-seven-one-eight. Strange name, I know, but I'm pretty sure. See, I carved it in the floor when I first got down here so I wouldn't forget.
Huge King| Oh!  Oh! So marvelous!
Huge King|  Oh!  Ooh-hoo-hoo! Ah-ha-ha!
Huge King| Oh. Oh my, oh my. 
Finn|  Well, that was actually pretty cool, but I should probably get going.
Huge King| Wh-a-a-a-at?! But, how can you leave now?  The clock is set to chime again in merely an hour's time!
Finn| I feel like Jake should've been here by now. I mean, what if he's lost, or--or hurt?
Huge King| But... this is not the Huge Kingdom Way.
Finn|  Sorry man. I've got my mind made up.
Finn| Thanks for the food, though!
Huge King| Food boys!  Seize the child!
Huge King| I'm sorry son, but this is for your own good. If you just stay put, all you need will come to you in time, like it has unto me. But, you must sit, you must wait.  Yes, yes tie him up with normal spaghetti and bring him food, yes! 
Huge King| Soon you will see, my boy! All good things come to those who wait.
Seven| It started out as a day like any other. I was a door-to-door sales bear specializing in candles and playing cards, making my way to the Candy Kingdom like I'd done 200 times before.
Seven| I guess my horse got stung by a bee or something, 'cause all of a sudden he just skronked the math out. We went off-road and I got thrown back into my wagon.
Seven| When the shaking stopped I crawled out, only to find I was wedged deep in a hole and sinking fast. I had just enough time to rig up a parachute...
Seven| ...And I've been falling ever since. Sometimes walnuts would fall into the hole, and sometimes rain.
Seven| And I guess that was enough.
Jake|  Mm. So how did you pass the time?
Seven| Well, for a long time I just waited to be rescued.
Seven|  599 Mississippi... 3,600 Mississippi... 
Seven| But that was crazy boring.
Seven|  So then I got really into Freecell and things got a lot better.
Jake| Freecell?
Seven| Yeah, it's like Solitaire but there's very few unsolvable shuffles.
Jake| Mm.
Seven| It's a great game, great game. I really love it.  But it's nice, you know, to have someone I can play Freecell alongside of.
Jake| Yeah, man. You know, also, I know some other card games we could play. You know, together.
Seven|  I forgot there were games like that!
Huge King|" And then, there was another time--This was several years back--The clock chimed early, and I thought, ""oh boy, here we go."" But it turned out, one of the food boys had simply gotten wedged under... Finn!"
Finn| Huh?
Huge King| Are you listening?!
Finn| Of course. Food boy in the clock.
Huge King| Huh. Yes.  Anyway, as I was saying, one of the food boys had gotten himself wedged in the...
Finn|  All right buddy, let's run through this again. 'Cause we're only gonna get one sht.
Finn| When the clock strikes 12, I beckon kindly to yonder food boys.
Finn| Hey, you guys like clean jokes?
Finn| Then chuck some delicious food in their mouths. Having never before known generosity, they'll immediately make me their leader and undo my spaghetti.
Finn| Ha ha!
Finn| Then, with a perfectly timed serving tray, I'll deflect the hunter bot's brass arrow.
Finn| Swift but delicate, the arrow will gain heft via the chandelier bat's filched asparagus.
Finn|  Meanwhile, the serving tray from before has entered phase two, sending Ken Mangosteen careening into the clean silverware.
Finn| But also, the asparagus arrow has caused a domino thing of food to happen, culminating in a huge lemon falling.
Finn| It's not a perfect plan, but with a little luck, I think it's got a good chance.
Finn| Hey, you guys like clean jokes?
Finn| Ha ha!
Huge King| What the--Food boys, sieze the child!
Huge King| Finn?! Finn! There's nowhere to run, Finn. You know you'll never escape. 
Finn|  I'm not trying to escape anymore!  I'm gonna murder your stupid clock, you psycho!
Huge King|  No!
Finn| Yup!
Huge King| Nooooo!
Seven| ♪Crazy interest, Accumulate, Figures, Bigger interest
Seven| ♪Warm scarves, To the hot house, Take your... socks off...
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|  Oh! Hey, Finn! Who's your new friend?
Finn| He's not my friend, he's bad! He kidnapped the heck out of me!
Jake|  Why you...
Huge King|  What are you gonna do about it? Maybe I'll go ahead and kidnap you t--!
Finn| Whoo!
Finn| Hey, Seven. Now that you're out of that hole, what's the first thing you want to do?
Seven| Hmm... Oh! I want a giant flipping hot dog. Mmm!
Finn| Yeugh.  Don't you know those things are made out of, like, the grossest junk?
Seven| Man, I don't give a toot!
Head Clown Nurse|  Who wants a cookie?  Milk-dipped chocolate chip cookie?
Finn|  No thanks.
Head Clown Nurse|  Now, come on, Finn. You have to eat. Open Sesame...
Finn|  Uh, Jake, can't we get rid of these Clown Nurses? They make me feel ridiculous.
Jake|  No way, man.
Jake|  Well, now you know we can't jump off of birds.  I paid them up front. They don't leave until the job's done. Besides...  They're funny.   Look, she just farted.
Head Clown Nurse|  Time for our love therapy.
Finn|  Wait, what are they doing?  Whoa! Stop!
Head Clown Nurse|   Oh my! Did that hurt, dear?
Finn|  NO!! I just don't want you kissing my toe!
Head Clown Nurse|"  Now, now, honey, you gotta understand. This is the only way to ""foo-foo"" your boo-boo."
Finn|  What does that even mean??
Jake|  I don't know... but I'm feeling better already. Ah. That tickles.
Big Clown Nurse|  You want me to stop?
Jake|  No, keep going. 
Finn|   You're gross, man.  Look! Deep in the forest of trees, there's a Cyclops whose magical tears can heal any wound. See? See?
Head Clown Nurse|  Maybe you should leave the medical decisions to the medical professionals, and my professional prescription is... your toe needs crazy smooches! It's the only way! 
Finn|  Huh? Wha?
Finn|  Wait! Wait! Wait! There's another way! There's my way! Let me show you my way!
Finn|  Ahh! Let me go! 
Head Clown Nurse|  It's the only way! 
Head Clown Nurse|   It's the only way!
Finn|  MY WAY!!
Finn|  Hmmm...
Tree Stump|  Ring, ring! Look, there's only two choices, bro. Take your pick. There's the path on the left, Hair Fall-Out Path. No more hair again, ever! Or the path on the right, Smelly Path. Makes you smelly forever. Hoohoo, you won't believe it.
Finn|  Isn't there another way?
Tree Stump|  Nope.
Finn|  But what if I just went—
Tree Stump|  No, that's it! You have to choose! There's no other way! Choosing is the only way. Choosing—is the only—way.
Head Clown Nurse|  It's the only way! 
Tree Stump|  Hey, listen man, the Smelly Path's not actually that bad!
Finn|  NO! I choose MY WAY!!  My way.
Bush|  Ring ring. Hello, dummy police? Yes, there's a strange dummy lurking around my house. Okay, yes. Thank you. Goodbye.
Finn|  Wha...?  I need to cross the river. The Cyclops is over there.
Bush|  You can't cross this river. It's impossible! Look! The current is so fast, it'll turn your butt inside-out for real, doofus. And the water's so acidic it'll crump your boat in half. It's like orange juice. It's gross. There's a bridge, but it's a trap! Plus, the water's jamming with electric eels. Wow, so weird. Anyway, that's it, there's no other way around, you dummy.
Finn|  But I need to get across.
Bush|  Listen what I'm telling you. There's no way. ...Ugly tramp.
Finn|  Glob, Glob it, Glob it, Glob it...
Bush|"  Huh? What are you saying? ""Globbit, Globbit""? Who's Globbit?"
Finn|  MY WAY!!
Bush|  Glibby glob, man! You're crazy! We're not even half way across! You gotta go back, man! It's the only way, you ugly fat-smelling fat-head!
Finn|  NO, MY WAY!! 
Finn|   MY WAY!  Oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob, oh, Glob.
Pan|  Uhh, excuse me, friend.  You're pretty tall, can you reach up there and get my wheel for me? Gotta get these melons home to my wife. You know how it is.
Finn|   MY WAY! 
Pan|  Watch out, Rainy!
Pan|   Rainy!
Finn|  Whoops. Uh... man, I'm real sorry.
Pan|  Yeah?  No doy... friend.
Finn|  But... I can still help. I'll fix your house for you.
Pan|  Just get out of here! Leave us alone!
Finn|  Uh... wh... I... 
Pan|  Psycho fink.
Finn|  ♫ I was wrong. Was I wrong? No. Yes... Yes... I was wrong. How could it be? I trusted in my guts, but ended up all nuts. I was wrong. How could it be? Listened to my brain, but ended up insane. The melons rolled...over that lady. I went too far. How could it be?  How did I go... too far? ♫
Forest Cyclops|  Hey! I know you're here for my magical tears, but you won't have any, because I never cry.
Finn|  I don't want 'em anymore.
Forest Cyclops|  What? Stop lying. You're here for my tears, aren't you?
Finn|  No. I hurt a small, hairy man's wife. I just wanna go home.
Forest Cyclops|  You're just trying to make me feel sad so you can steal my tears when I cry... but I've got a heart of stone, buddy. I'm EVIL!
Finn|  Dude! What's wrong with you? I said I don't want your tears!
Forest Cyclops|  YOU'RE LYING!
Finn|  I'M NOT LYING!!!
Forest Cyclops|   You stink at lying.
Finn|  Fine. Whatever, man. Have it your way.
Forest Cyclops|  Okay... I WILL HAVE IT MY WAY!!
Finn|  Huh? 
Forest Cyclops|  Beg for mercy, or I'll kill you!
Finn|  
Forest Cyclops|  Whuh... What?
Finn|  
Forest Cyclops|  What? I can't hear you.
Finn|  I said... MY WAY!!
Finn|  Magical tear drops.  My way can still work! Yeah!
Rainy|  Huh? I'm okay.
Pan|  Yay!
Bush|  Huh?  Whoa!
Tree Stump|  Huh? Whoo-hoo.
Ham Sandwich|  Yeah!
Jake|  Oh, yeah. Huh?
Head Clown Nurse|  Have you come crying back for your proper treatment, Babylips?
Finn|  Kiss that!
Head Clown Nurse|  Oh, my! You look horribly injured! My kisses will make heal you.  Now how does that feel?
Forest Cyclops|  Bittersweet.
Finn|  Hey, man. You want me to heal your toe with my magical goo?
Jake|  Ah, no thanks. I think the kisses work better.  Excuse me, don't stop, keep going, please. 
Finn|  You're gross.
Jake|  Hey! We all have our own ways.
Finn|   You know what? You're... right.
Finn|  Hahahaha! Here I go!
Jake|  Yeah!
Finn|   Whoo-hoo!!
Marceline|  Hmm...
Finn|  Awesome!  Someone needs our help!
Marceline|"   What is it about ""henchman for life"" that you don't understand?"
Old Man Henchman|  Oh, come on!
Finn|   Dude! It's Marceline the Vampire Queen!
Old Man Henchman|  Can't you find the compassion to release this poor old body?
Marceline|"  ""Henchman for life"" means, ""henchman for life!!"""
Finn|   You still petrified of vampires?
Jake|   No... I'm not...
Marceline|   Fall on the ground for me!
Old Man Henchman|  Yes, Mistress. 
Marceline|  Now cry for me!
Old Man Henchman|  Okay. I don't want to cry, but I shall cry for you. 
Finn|   Hey! Cut that out!
Marceline|  Oh! If it isn't my favorite little goodie-two-shoes Finn!
Finn|  Stop making this poor old dude cry!
Marceline|  I can make him do whatever I want. Watch. Henchman, amuse me.
Finn|  Stop it!
Marceline|  Now hop around in a circle.
Finn|  Oh, no. Don't worry, sir. I'll see to it you get set free.
Marceline|  Oh, and how're ya gonna pull that off, hero?
Finn|  I'll do what I need to. I'll even take his place!
Jake|  Dude, what?!
Marceline|  Do you mean it?
Finn|  Uh... well...  Heck yeah!
Marceline|  Deal! Old henchman, you're free.
Old Man Henchman|  Whoo-hoo! 
Jake|  What're you doing, man?
Marceline|  Hey, Jake.... BLEH!! 
Jake|  EEH! 
Finn|  I couldn't watch that old man suffer, Jake. My code of honor wouldn't allow it.
Marceline|"    ""Oh, my code of honor wouldn't allow it."" "
Jake|  Rrrr... HEY!
Marceline|  Yes, Jake?  What would you like to talk about?!
Jake|  AAAH!  I wanna help you outta this, man, but... she scares the filling out of my doughnut. Let's just leave.
Finn|  I can't. As a hero, I'm bound by my  WOOOOORD!!
Jake|  FINN!  Don't worry, dude! I'll figure something out!!
Marceline|  You're lucky, Finn. Your first job as henchman is to help me feed.
Finn|   Feed?! What does she mean? L-Like, like, oats? Like, sentient beings, or oats?! It doesn't matter! I can handle it!
Marceline|  Sounds like dinner. Finn, open the door.  OPEN IT ALREADY!
Finn|  No way, Marceline! I'm not gonna open this door if innocent people will be hurt!
Marceline|  Aren't you bound by your word to do as I say, hero?
Finn|  I...  Yes... 
Eberhardt|  Huh?
Finn|  Sorry about this.
Eberhardt|   Haah!
Marceline|  Hold him down!  Are you enjoying this, Finn?
Finn|  No!
Jake|   Rrr... Don't you worry, Finn. I'll get you outta there. I've got a perfect plan!  AAH!  I'm not running away, Finn! This is just part of my plan!!
Eberhardt|  Please, human boy! Let me go!
Finn|  I'm sorry, sir. I'm bound by my code of honor to do what she says.
Eberhardt|  I understand, son. I was married myself once. 
Finn|  Wait, wait! I'm not married to—
Marceline|   Ugh! Enough talking! Dinner is served!
Finn|  No!  No! 
Marceline|  How dare you, henchman?! I order you to let me feed!
Finn|  NOOOOO!!!
Marceline|  Mmm. That red bow tie was delicious!
Finn|   Huh? 
Marceline|  What's wrong, Finn?
Finn|  I... I thought you were—
Eberhardt|  Oh, my! A white tie! Thank you so much! This is so beautiful! 
Finn|  B-but...
Marceline|  What? You know I eat the color red sometimes. 
Finn|  Oh... Yeah... Okay...
Marceline|  We've got plenty more evil to do! 
Finn|   Man... What's wrong with this girl? I can't tell if she's messin' with me, or... or what.
Marceline|  Hey, Finn. You thinkin' about how that guy's bow tie sorta looked like a bra?
Finn|  Huh? No!
Marceline|  I know this place seems a little dead, but don't worry. It'll soon be undead.  Corpses buries in mud that's black, from death I command you to come back! ] Hahaha! Are you ready to lead an evil army of the undead?!
Finn|  Uhh, NEVER!  Okay! I'll do it!
Jake|   Don't worry, dude. I'm comin' to help you. YAAAAH!! 
Marceline|  Huh? What's that noise?
Jake|   Sorry, Finn.
Marceline|  Excited to hear the wild screams of an entire castle?
Finn|   Haha, aw, yeah, that sounds bombastic, honey! Hey, I'm gonna run up ahead and scout it out for you, sugar! 
Marceline|  Hahaha!
Lisby|  Yeeees? Duke and Duchess of Nuts' residence!
Finn|  My boss is gonna sack your castle!
Lisby|  Oh! Well, that's certainly bad news for us!
Duke of Nuts|  Lisby! Who's at the door?
Lisby|  Someone who wishes to sack the nut castle!
Duke of Nuts|  Why would you want to sack my nut castle on my second son's first birthday?! SEIZE HIM!
Finn|  No!  Listen! You hear that?! My master is marching here with her army of the undead!
Duke of Nuts|  Oh! How wonderful!
Finn|  Listen to me!!  EVERYBODY!! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!
Marceline|  Hahaha!  I wrote this next song about a fisherman. 
Finn|  Don't do this, Marceline! I beg you!
Marceline|  Don't do what?
Duke of Nuts|  You're late, Marceline! My son has been dying to hear your undead music!
Finn|  Wha?!
Lisby|  Oh, I forgot! Marceline is playing tonight!
Finn|  Okay... So, she makes things seem bad, a-and then... or-or her personality makes them seem bad, or...  I'm over-reacting.
Lisby|  Hey!
Finn|  Huh?
Lisby|  Why are you thinking so hard?! Just party hard! Whoo!
Finn|  Alright! Whoo-hoo! Hahahaha!
Marceline|  Hey, castle-crasher!
Finn|  Hey, Marceline!
Marceline|  You like cute things, right?
Finn|  Uh, yeah, sure. Why?
Marceline|  Then you might love this. The cutest dimple plant ever!
Finn|  Whoa-ho-ho! That's cool!
Marceline|  Here, eat some of its fruit. See what happens.
Finn|   Hahaha! A dimple!
Marceline|  Okay, henchman, now... I need you to do something.
Finn|  What is it?
Marceline|  I want you to take this dimple plant outside, and kill it!
Finn|  What?!
Marceline|   Use my ax bass.
Finn|  I'm gonna murder you. I'm not entirely sure why. I'm sure this will end happy...  AAH! I don't get it! There's always a twist to the stuff Marceline makes me do, but where's the twist in bumping off this bush?!
Marceline|   There is no twist. Kill it now!
Finn|  But wh—
Marceline|  You should've hacked it to pieces when it was still adorable...
Finn|  I-I thought—  Sick!!
Marceline|  Oh, boy...  Not bad... for a henchman.
Finn|   Hmm...
Finn|  Hey. Can't the sun, like, destroy you?
Marceline|  Yeah, it hurts, but I kinda like it. Reminds me of when I'd scrape my knees up as a kid, and my mom would patch me up... you know what I'm sayin'?
Finn|  Uh... Jake told me I came out of a cabbage.
Marceline|  Hey, Finn, I need you to strangle some pixies.
Finn|  Yeah, sure. That sounds good.
Marceline|  Whoa, why are you being so casual about that? Strangling pixies is some hardcore evil.
Finn|  I'm not fallin' for your junk anymore, lady! You just like sayin' poop that jacks with my brain!
Marceline|   What are you talking about? I...  Dang, man, I didn't think you'd ever catch on!
Finn|   I knew it! Hey... what about your old henchman? Who was that guy?
Marceline|  Oh, just an old diving buddy.   So, you ready to go strangle some pixies?
Finn|  Yeah, man! I mean, wo-man.
Jake|   Oh, no! My buddy is totally under her vampire spell!  Die, unholy thing! 
Finn|  Jake?
Marceline|   Ow! 
Finn|  Marceline!
Jake|  I'm stakin' that vampire and settin' you free, no matter how terrified I am!
Finn|  She's alright, man!
Jake|  She's still controlling your mind with evil! Now, back off and let me vanquish her from existence!
Finn|  I can't let you do that, Jake!
Jake|   I love you, brother. YAAAH! 
Finn|  Jake, listen! Marceline is not how she seems! She's a radical dame who likes to play games!
Jake|  What are you even talkin' about, dude?!
Finn|  Oh, man! 
Jake|  MARCELINE!  Where is she?!
Finn|   I-I'm free! Jake! You faced your fear and saved me!
Jake|  I did?! I did! Yeah!  I saved my bro from a scum-sucking vampire!! 
Marceline|   Is it cool?
Finn|  Yup!
Marceline|  Finn, I owe you big-time! Changing into a bat and hiding in your pack was genius!
Finn|  That's what henchmen are for.
Marceline|  Oh, uh, that reminds me. You're fired from your henchman-ship. It's no fun when I can't trick you.
Finn|  We're still on for pixie-strangling tomorrow, though, right?
Marceline|   Definitely.
Cosmic Owl| I'm home!  Who's going to have dinner with me tonight? Sorry fellas, i gotta go make some dreams come true. Where are we headed, dream token? Aha, ah Finn again.
Finn| Ahahahaha!
Dream Jake| Say Cheese!
Finn| Cheese!
Cosmic Owl| Hoo! Hoo!
Dream Jake| Ah, ungus!
Finn| Hello! Huh? Wait! Wait!
Cosmic Owl| Who's that?  She's so beautiful! Buttfeathers!
Finn| Huh! The cosmic owl? Does that mean this dream is important? Is this a prophetic dream? And is this stuff all symbolic or literal?
Cosmic Owl| Huh? Sorry, but...
Finn| What does it all mean, boy?
Cosmic Owl| Dang she's gone...wait, what are you asking me? I can't tell you that? Hoo!
Jake|  I don't know, Shelby. I think it's too dark in there!
Finn| AHH!
Jake| Pull 'im up, pull 'im up!
Finn| I think I just had a prophetic dream. Cosmic Owl was in it, he was acting all choco-loco.
Jake| Finn, you gotta go back to sleep!
Finn| Huh?
Jake| Cosmic owl dreams are important always! You gotta Go Back and find them again.
Finn| Yeah but last time I chased a cosmic owl dream I got dumped.
Jake| Get back in there! It's too important! You don't got time on my class ring, or bets with Shelby, or Stomach fishing! Oop!
Finn| What?
Jake| Alright let's do it! 
Finn| Hey! Cosmic Owl, you still here? Whoop!
Cosmic Owl| Buttfeathers!  Love is weird, man! It really does come when you least expect it!
Prismo| Dude, you've been working on that since you got here! Take a break! You haven't even asked me about my banjo lessons. There going great! Dude?
Cosmic Owl| Sorry, I just can't stop thinking about her.
Prismo| Ah, you really are in love, huh! Alright, tell me more about her! Where'dya'meet?
Cosmic Owl| In a dream.
Prismo| What! Who's?
Cosmic Owl| Finn the human.
Prismo| What? Who's that! Oh, wait, I know that guy. Look, I don't think you're put in charge of prophetic dreams so you could meet ladies.
Cosmic Owl|" ""Hoo"" cares. I'm in love!"
Prismo| Oh, what am I even worried about. How will you ever even find her again? Do you have any idea how many people are dreaming every night?
Cosmic Owl| Yes, I do.
Prismo| Dude, it could take you a million years
Cosmic Owl| Then it would be worth it! For love! Forgot my sketchbook.
Cosmic Owl|  Looks like it's gonna be a long night. Ehh. 
Cosmic Owl| Excuse me, are these weenies?
Waiter| Shrimp puffs, m'azheer.
Cosmic Owl| Oh.
Bird Woman| *sighs*
Cosmic Owl| Hi.
Bird Woman| Oh, is that a weenie?
Cosmic Owl| It's a shrimp puff.
Bird Woman| Oh I love shrimp puffs!
Cosmic Owl| Here.
Bird Woman| This is a dream come true!
Bird Woman| Do I know you?
Cosmic Owl| I'm crashing.
Bird Woman| Oh!
Cosmic Owl| I saw you in a dream and I had to see you again, even though just by me being here, events in this dream will come true.
Cosmic Owl| Oh geez, that poor guy.
Bird Woman| Whose dream?
Cosmic Owl| Hm?
Bird Woman| Whose dream did you se me in?
Cosmic Owl| Um, Finn the Human.
Bird Woman| Hm.
Cosmic Owl| I shouldn't be here.
Bird Woman| No, you intrigue me! So powerful! Wha? What's happening?
Cosmic Owl| You're waking up.
Bird Woman| Oh no!
Cosmic Owl| Can't you go back to sleep?
Bird Woman| No, once I'm up, I'm up!
Cosmic Owl| But I wanna see you again!
Bird Woman| I'd like that.
Cosmic Owl| Okay, I'll bookmark your dream coordinates and come to you tomorrow night!
Bird Woman| What do I do with the toothpick?
Cosmic Owl| I'll take it.
Prismo|"  and so then she's like, ""I really like you"" and I said ""I really like you too"" and then she said ""I don't wanna hold hands until I'm in love"" and I'm like ""that's great, I'm all about going slow"" and then she's like ""what? You don't wanna hold my hand?."" Ha ha! Okay, what is going on with that toothpick?"
Cosmic Owl| Huh?
Prismo| I can get you a new toothpick.
Cosmic Owl| No, I don't want a new one! I gotta go!
Prismo| No wait, there's one m—
Cosmic Owl|  Hi.
Bird Woman| Hi!
Cosmic Owl| Are there any appetizers?
Bird Woman| No, I think it's just ice in this dream. Oh I wish I could dream another place!
Cosmic Owl| I have an idea.  My apartment.
Bird Woman| Oh.
Cosmic Owl| It's a bit of a mess. I'm not used to having company.
Bird Woman| No, it's got personality.
Cosmic Owl| I know right! Hey, do you like board games?
Bird Woman| Tell me about this.
Cosmic Owl| Oh, I use that for work.
Bird Woman| It's interesting.
Cosmic Owl| Hey, you wanna, spy on people's dreams?
Bird Woman| Can we?
Cosmic Owl| Sure! Hehehe.
Bird Woman| What's it like to have all this fingertips?
Cosmic Owl| I guess I just don't even think of it.
Bird Woman| But you're not powerful enough to see everyone's dreams, are you?
Cosmic Owl| I'm totally that powerful.
Bird Woman| Even royalty?
Cosmic Owl| Like Ice King or something? His dreams are so sad.
Bird Woman| Like Princess Bubblegum? Oh, surely she has some dream security system in place.
Cosmic Owl| Ha ha ha, we can go right now. Is that what this is about?
Bird Woman| Yes, let's go right now.
Cosmic Owl| Ahahaha this feels weird, it seemed like you really wanna go. It's okay to feel manipulated, right? 
Princess Bubblegum| Oh thank you, thank you!
Candy People| Yay!!! Boooo!!!
Princess Bubblegum| After all I've done for you?
Cosmic Owl| Huh? Something's wrong. Does this dream seem weird to you? Hoo!
Princess Bubblegum| No. I worked so hard! Ahhhhh!
Cosmic Owl| Hey, hey you!
Bird Woman| Huh?
Cosmic Owl| no. What have you done?  You interfered with a dream! Oh man, a dream I was in! Why did you do it?
Bird Woman| I just can't really explain. It felt like the right thing to do!
Cosmic Owl| You, you ruined everything! We would've been so perfect together. A— who am I kidding, it's over.
Bird Woman| It doesn't have to be over, we can run away, together!
Cosmic Owl| Your dreamin' kid, and it's time to wake up.
Bird Woman| No!
Cosmic Owl| Hoo!
Gunter|  Wenk!
Ice King| Gunter? Aw, did baby have a bad dream? Let me get you a bottle.
Penguins| Wenk!
Gunter| Wenk!
Ice King| Huh? What's heatin' him?
Jake|  Hey, what kind of coffee do you want?
Finn|"  Hazelnut! Hazelnut! What if your name was ""Zelnut""? And then I would be all like ""Hey, Zelnut."""
Jake|  That's terrible.
Finn|  Hey, Zelnut.
Jake|  Nooooo! Stop!
Finn|  You hear that?
Jake|  Yeah.
Finn and Jake|  Susan Strong!?
Susan|  Finn, help Susan.
Finn|  Of course I will.
Jake|  Excuse us for a moment, Strong.  Dude, you know you're my bro, but that girl is bad news.
Finn|  What? Naw.
Jake|  She's crazy, man. She's a fish person!
Finn|  We don't know that!
Jake|  Dude, she tried to eat Peppermint Butler! She'd probably be worse if she was so scared of everything.
Finn|  Whatever, look, she needs my help... and I'm gonna help her whether you're coming with me or not.
Jake|  Oh, I'm coming with you if only to be disruptive and obnoxious!
Finn|  Susan, what can we do?
Susan|  I need your hero heart and your magic.
Finn|  My magic?
Susan|   Magic of red flower.
Jake|   Fish people.
Susan|  Long ago, my people live in Beautopia... but driven out by Lub Glubs. We come here. We too scared to fight back. This why we need your hero heart. Hyoomans!  I'll be back!
Jake|  Fish People! I'll be, um, a dolphin! 
Susan|  Come on. We swim there.
Finn|  No, you don't understand. I'm not a fish person. I'm human.
Susan|   We go.
Jake|  Grrr... What? Hey, hey. What?
Susan|   You no gills.  We take boat.
Jake|  Oooh... I'm on a boat with a couple of wackos. Shakin' my hips, and dippin' my fat toe... In the water! Dippin' in the water! This party's gettin' hotter! It's so hot... it's stupid. So where we headed, Susan?
Susan|  There. 
Jake|  Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no, no! No, Susan, no!
Finn|   That was awesome. See, Jake? We can trust Susan. She's on the trolley.
Susan|  Keeps looking for Lub Glubs.
Susan|   No move!
Susan|  Whew, we safe now. 
Finn|   What?
Jake|  Dude, she's crazy.
Finn|  She's not crazy! She's cool!
Jake|  Whatever, man. This is a crazy cruise, and Susan is our crazy captain... and I'm a crazy clam-shell! Woo-ep!  Oh, doing the clam!
Finn|   Quit acting like a clam, you ham.
Jake|  Hey, you hearing that too?
Susan|  Getting close to the Lub Glubs' mash-'em-ups.
Jake|   Huh?
Susan|  Behold!
Finn|  Balzacs! 
Susan|  The clashing gates!
Susan|   'S okay. Susan know when is safe to pass through.
Jake|  Uh-huh. Finn, let's get outta here.
Finn|  Come on. She knows this place. Trust. We're ready when you are, Susan.
Jake|  You know, I could just stretch us over this thing.
Susan|  Go... now!
Susan|  Oh, good. Still got some boat left.
Jake|  She's flippin' crazy! Come on, Finn. Let's bail.
Finn|  Chill out.
Finn|  Alright, Susan, what do we do next?
Susan|  Hmm... never made this far before. Just gotta get past Lub Glubs.
Finn|  Yeah, what are Lub Glubs, exactly?
Susan|  They... umm, look, they like this. 
Finn|  Hmm.
Jake|  That looks like... my father. ...Now I'm crazy!
Susan|  Yes. Lub Glubs crazy scary. Hyoomans scared so long. Even Susan. That why glad I meet you. You have brave heart. 
Finn|   Thank... you...
Susan|    We here? We at B-Beautopia! 
Jake|  Oh, thank Glob.
Finn|  Whoa... Ominous.
Susan|  We's be alls good once bring red flower to city heart.
Jake|  What's making all that swishing?
Susan|  Lub Glubs! They coming!
Jake|   It's just more pool floaties!
Susan|   Shh! Shh! Too many Lub Glubs to fight!
Jake|  Susan! Susan, Lub glubs are just pool toys!  Watch, I'm putting an end to all this craziness, with my Pickaxe Hand!  No more craziness.
Jake|  Ooooh... Jakey beefed it!
Jake|  Bad news, dude. There's only two of us and more than, um,  this many of them!
Finn|  We gotta use the fire, like Susan said. Are you okay with that?
Jake|  Yes! I'm okay with that! I'll do whatever Susan says! 
Finn|  Susan! We need you! 
Susan|   Susan scared... but Susan brave, too.  SUUSSSAAANN!!!!! 
Finn|  Yeah, Susan!
Finn|  Susan!
Susan|   Finn! Jake!
Jake|   I gots it!
Susan|  Red flower! Throw it to city heart!
Jake|  Finn, win aide to fair Susan! Jake brings the fire!
Finn|"  Humans and ""Hyoomans"" got to stick together!"
Finn|  Huh?
Susan|   Hmm.
Jake|   Almost... there...  Oh, so I just toss it in here? Pretty straightforward. Okay, well, here I go.  one, two, three...   That reminds me of... my mother. 
Finn|  It's working, Susan!  Jake.
Jake|  Whoa. It is beautiful.
Finn|  You were right, Susan. This place is great. Well, we'd better get home.
Susan|  Finn, you stay.
Finn|  No, I can't. I'm not like you.
Finn|  Susan...
Jake|   C'mon, Finn, let's go! I grabbed, like, 100 soft pretzels!
Princess Bubblegum|  
Finn| Good morning, Princess!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn! You scared me!
Finn| I am sorry, Princess!
Princess Bubblegum| What are you doing here, Finn?
Finn| Since I got out of my last relationship, I've been slackin' on the job. So I'm rededicating my life to protecting, serving, and meeting your every need. Jake said I was acting bananas about the whole thing and wanted no part of this.
Princess Bubblegum| It's 530 in the morning.
Finn| That's right, Princess. I'm gettin' back on the job hardcore, giving 100% of my being all for you.
Princess Bubblegum| Thank you, that's very nice. 
Finn| No need to thank me, PB. It's my job.
Finn| Heh.
Princess Bubblegum| Thank you. 
Finn|  How am I doin' my job, Princess? Am I crushin' it?
Princess Bubblegum| Yes, but can you move just a bit...
Princess Bubblegum| No, no, like, out of the way.
Finn| Oh! 
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, what else do I need? Aw, dangit, I forgot we're out of milk. Now I have to go get it from—
Finn|  Buh-buh-buh! I got it!  Hyah!
Finn| Milk... You wanted milk...
Princess Bubblegum| Finn, I thought you went home.
Finn| Yes, I do regret the slow return, but I assure you, this is the highest quality milk available. It's mink's milk. I milked a mink. 100% dedication, no limits for what I do for you. I'd throw Peppermint Butler off this balcony if you ask.  Sorry, Peppermint Butler, just joking, but kinda sorta not.
Princess Bubblegum|  You're really going over the top here. Take it easy. Princess's orders.
Finn| Okay, I'll just rest here.
Princess Bubblegum| No, no, resting on the job is not resting. Go somewhere where you can relax!
Finn| Yes, Princess. 
Finn|  Princess, I give my life to you girl, you are the best dang princess in the whole wide world.  Wow, PB, sure is a nice day to be outside!  Hey, watch what you say about PB, bro. Talk garbage about PB one more time, bro. See what happens!  Hold on one sec, PB. I gotta deal with a real tough guy over here.  You got one last chance to apologize before I dishonor you like you did my lady! Alright, bro, have it your way! Yah!  Where's your pants bro? Where's your honor now? Everyone's laughing at your undies! It's real uncomfortable! Wants some!  Wowzers!  No!  Did you drop this car on my lady, bro?!
Rattleballs| Leave this dump now! 
Finn| You dropped a car on my lady, bro. Now I gotta restore her honor. I hope you're wearing underwear.  Whoa, dude's got awesome powers.  Hey, dude, you got awesome powers!  You gonna kill me, bro?
Rattleballs| No. Instead, I will pluck out your eyes with the point of my sword, and whenever you try to see stuff, you will think only of me, Rattleballs! 
Finn| Do it! I ain't a baby!  Do it, bro! 
Rattleballs| You have a warrior's spirit!  Something I haven't seen in a long time. But your swordsmanship is . You should learn to master your weapon before you draw it. 
Finn| What?! You're just gonna tell me I'm terrible and walk away? Teach me sword stuff, man! 
Rattleballs| I know you're back there.
Finn| I brought you a muffin.
Rattleballs| I don't eat muffins; I'm a robot. 
Finn| Look, I know you don't know me and we got off on the wrong foot, but please, dude, teach me how to use the sword. Please!  You okay?
Rattleballs| No. When I was a young robot, I went horseback riding. No one taught me how to post. The horse took a crazy jump, and I came down on the saddle hard. One of my gumballs bounced up inside me. It's been lodged in a weird spot for years.
Finn| Oh, here. 
Rattleballs| More to the left! Getting closer. Closer!  You got it!  Thank you!
Finn| Yeah, perhaps you feel a sense of indebted obligation to me?
Rattleballs| Yes! I will teach you the sword stuff.
Rattleballs| Lesson one block my eggs! 
Finn| Yut!  Ha, got one!
Rattleballs| Hahahahaha! Egg-celent! 
Finn| Yeah! That's right! I can take it! 
Rattleballs| You have done well today! You have felt the sting of the yolk, endured the sizzle of the mini-BBQ. Perhaps you are ready to learn my secret technique.
Finn| Secret technique!
Rattleballs| Watch! 
Finn| What the—?! 
Rattleballs| The shadowless thrust. Your blade must be swift enough to slice the air between you and the target, removing all wind resistance.  Now you try.  Again. 
Finn| So, am I a master swordsman now? 
Rattleballs| You will be if you train this hard every day... for ten years... and get a robot body.
Finn| Oh. So, uh, why you livin' in this dump? You should be out in the world, saving fancy ladies and junk.
Rattleballs| That, my friend, is a long tale... which I will tell you now.  It was a much wilder time in the Candy Kingdom. I was a member of an elite robot police force created by Princess Bubblegum. Her previous attempts at law enforcement had been a bunch of goofs. 
Shop Owner| Stop Him!
Banana Guards| Go! Go! Go! Go! 
Rattleballs| Our righteous swords cut a swath through the chaos, but we were too successful.  Unfortunately, we were still programmed for violence. 
Princess Bubblegum| One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two. Okay, robots, all the number ones, go stand on that platform over there. And all the number twos, just turn around and face the wall.  And no peeking!
Rattleballs| We were programmed to follow her commands 100%, but through sheer force of will, I was able to overcome it.  We had been judged too dangerous to stay operational and sentenced to death! 
Princess Bubblegum| Number twos! Chop, chop! 
Rattleballs| I alone escaped, while my compatriots became minimalist furniture. 
Finn| Oh, sorry! 
Rattleballs| I've lived as a fugitive in this junkyard ever since. That is why you must never tell Princess Bubblegum about me. If she ever found out, she would have me destroyed.
Princess Bubblegum| Rattleballs is still what?!
Finn| He asked me not to tell you, but I cannot break my oath to serve you, my lady, 100%.
Princess Bubblegum| Captain Root Beer Guy,  assemble my guard! 
Rattleballs| Hello, Princess.
Finn| Sorry Ree-B-Z. My oath to the princess comes first, but once you two talk it out, I know she'll see you mean no harm.
Princess Bubblegum| Banana Guards, destroy!
Rattleballs| So be it! 
Finn| Wait! 
Banana Guards| CHARGE!  WEEWOOWEEWOO!  CHARGE! 
Rattleballs| Rattleballs! 
Finn| RB, don't!
Rattleballs| You think I'm dangerous, Princess?
Princess Bubblegum| Dang right I do! You killed all my banana guards!
Finn| No, Princess, look! They're only bruised!
Banana Guards| Hey, you hit me!
Rattleballs| I no longer crave mindless violence. I have found peace in meditation, gardening, egg throwing. I also hope time has made you less bloodthirsty, princess, but do with me as you will. In my heart I still serve you, 100%.
TV| Bigger pimples mean bigger dimples, so mash- 
Princess Bubblegum| Ahem! Okay, everyone,  I took care of Rattleballs. 
Banana Guard| Oh! Wow! Cool!  Show's back on!
Princess Bubblegum| Everything's settled. I don't have to go back on my order, and you can protect the kingdom from the shadows.
Rattleballs| Thank you, Princess. That's marginally better than hiding in a dump. 
Princess Bubblegum| Wait!  I dub thee Sir Rattleballs! 
Jake|  Man... let's go home.
Finn|  Nuts to that. I wanna find a mystery cave.
Jake|   But, Finn, I'm gettin' all cranky around my joke-hole.
Finn|  Ow!
Jake|  Oof!
Finn|  Ooh-la-la.
Jake|  Whuzzat?
Finn|  Mystery cave! C'mon, Jake!  Oh, my glory...
Jake|  Dude, no!! Don't touch that thing! It's probably got some kind of sacred significance.
Finn|  Yeah. I want it for my sacred bathroom.
Jake|  Finn?!  Oh, my Jah! Finn's become one with the lamb!!
Finn|  Jake!! You see this crazy jazz?!
Jake|  We'll get through this, my bro. I swear, I'm gonna get you out of that lamb.
Finn|  Jake! C'mon quit messin' with me.  WHOA!
Jake|   Ow. Ow.  Ow. 
Jake|  Wish I knew how to free you, bro.
Finn|  Me, too, bro.
Jake|  BMO, stop fake-farting.
BMO|  But Finn always loved BMO farting. 
Finn|  Heh heh heh heh heh!
Jake|  Hmm...  That's it! We'll do all Finn's favorite stuff 'til he comes out! BMO! Play Finn's favorite song!
BMO|  Okay!
Finn|  What? Nooo...  No! Not this song!!
Jake|  Are you hearing this, buddy?
Finn|  Guys... I haven't liked this song since I was two.  Cut it OUT! 
Ice King|  Leaf Princess!  Come to me, my arboreal beauty! Gotcha!
Finn|   It's just a dumb old leaf, ya dumb old Ice King.
Ice King|   I know, but it's mine.
Finn|  Wait! What?! Ice King! You can hear me?
Ice King|  Yes... Why? Are you makin' fun of me or something?
Finn|  No, it's just no one else can see me or hear me talk.
Ice King|  Ohhhh, yeah.... You're trapped in the Spirit Realm. I can see all things Spirit with my... Wizard Eyes!
Finn|  Man... Never thought I'd be happy to talk to you, Ice King. Can ya help me get free??
Ice King|  Oh, yeah, I know all the ins and outs. And I'd do anything for a friend like you.
Penguin|  Wenk.
Ice King|  Quiet, Gunter. Can'tya see I'm hanging with Finn?
Penguin|  Wenk wenk.
Ice King|  I know I say that a lot, but this time it's true!
Finn|  Anyways... Where do all these spirits come from?
Ice King|  Oh, there are portals all over the universe. I have one in my basement! Every once in a while, a real cutie pie drifts through. Ooh!  Oh, gosh, there she is.  Mm, oh, yeah... 
Finn|  Sick.
Ice King|  What? I swear I never touch 'em! I can't!  Can't touch this, can't touch this...  Can't touch this, either.  Yep, I can't kill any of them.   I hate them... Okay, alright! 'Nuff messin' around. Let's getcha free from the Spirit Plane.
Finn|  Cool.
Ice King|  Sooo, the only way to get out of the Spirit World is to stick all these lousy things in the Spirit Hole down there. Then plug up the hole with that.
Finn|  And doing that will set me back to normal??
Ice King|  Mm-hmmmm, trust me! We are tur-bros! Turbo bros! Tur-bros. Turbo. ...Bros.
Finn|   So be it!
Jake|  Alright, Finn. This oughta free you from your body prison. Couple-a' rounds of Kompy's Kastle will jog your psychic schnaps. That's what I think. Co-op mode like we always do! Oh, yeah! C'mon, Finn, drop the drawbridge. Kompy's blood lust meter's goin' down. Lemme help ya there.  Whuzza!! You love Kompy! 
Finn|  I... did it.  I did it. I'm ready, Ice King. Make me normal now.
Ice King|  Ohhh, that's not all of 'em. There's this other guy that watches me. He's... super creepy.  Do ya see it?? Oh, it see's you...  Catch it and put it in the Spirit Hole! In the Spirit Hole where it can't see me anymore so you can be free!!  Get it! Get it!!  GET IT IN THE HOLE!!
Finn|   Ew! Ew! Ew!  Eeeewwww!! 
Ice King|  Yes! It's gone!
Finn|  So... now I can go back to normal.
Ice King|  Uhhh, wait, though.
Finn|  ...What?
Ice King|  There's this last guy you gotta get. He's pretty much the worst. He usually leaves these gross heads around, but I'm not seeing them anywhe— OH!  THERE IT IS! THERE IT IS!!
Head|  Wanwan. Wanwan. Wanwan.
Ice King|   Nooo...
Head|  Wanwan! Wanwan!
Ice King|  NO! DON'T COME NEAR ME!!
Head|  Wanwan!
Finn|  What is that?
Ice King|  It's from the dead one. He leaves these heads around everywhere. I can't even touch them, but it still creeps me out...
Head|  Wanwan!
Ice King|  Please get rid of him!
Finn|  What do I do? Follow the heads?
Ice King|   USE THE HEADS!! Oh, snow, please!
Finn|   Alright, man, I'll get it.  Where's your daddy, huh? Is he hiding in there?
Head|  Wanwan.
Finn|  You better get back in the Spirit Hole, dead one.  Okay... 
The Dead One|   Wamwanwan.
Finn|  Oh, my what? The cave?? How the...??? ...Weird. That's weird, but whatevs, though.  Whatevs. Ice King! Ice Kiiiing!  Where'd you go, Simon?  Ice King?  Dude, come on, what?
Ice King|  Ha ha, Finn! You fell right into for my brilliant plan  that I formed out of the thin air like a true Magi! Not only did I get you to remove those horrible creatures from my castle, but now you're trapped, and only I can see you. So if you want friends, this is it, pal! 
Finn|   I'm gonna re-open the hole.
Ice King|  NO, WAIT, MY PLAN FELL APART!!  My... new plan is that you don't open the hole, and I destroy the porcelain lamb which will bring you back to the material plane. Heh heh... heh.
Ice King|  Jake.  AGH, BLUH! GIMME THAT LAMB!
Jake|  NO!!  Finn's trapped in here!!
Ice King|  That's why I have to smash it!!
Jake|  You donk! I will smash you!! WAAAH!! 
Ice King|  Escaped!  AAAH! My winter body!! I was gonna start up on the elliptical again, but I got depressed, okay?! Don't look at me!! 
Jake|   Whoooo?!
Ice King|  AAH! They're touching me for real! EWW!!
Finn|  Great. Now we're both stuck in here.
Ice King|   FINN, GIVE ME YOUR CLOTHES! 
Finn|  STOP! WUUH!
Ice King|  I need a buffer!! AAAH! 
Finn|  Ah, jeez, come on!
Ice King|   I'm sorry... I'm sorry, they were just touching me on the body... I'm sorry... 
Finn|  Whoa, do that again.  Your hand is affecting the TV! We must have some kinda subtle effect on the material plane!
Ice King|  Cooool. Whaddaya think, Finn? Can we pull back the veil of static and reach into the source of all being? Behind this curtain of patterns... this random pattern generator... So clever... right here in every home, watching us from a one-sided mirror...  Heh heh heh, whoops! Just wizard-talkin' to myself!
Finn|  It's okay! But let's use our subtle influence to break the lamb!
Ice King|  Yeah, a'ight. You mean like this?
Finn|  Yeah, man! Bwoooo!  It's workin', man! Combine the swirls!
Ice King|  Okay! Wha-zah!!
Jake|  Whoa! Finn, is that you?!
Finn|   YES!!
Jake|  Finn! Finn! Finn!  Whooooaaaa...  That was beautiful!
Finn|  Heh-heh.
Jake|  Let's go flush this in the sacred bathroom!
Finn|  Yup! Yeah, totally stuck that landing!
BMO|  Yeah! Woo woo!
Finn|  Man, it's been so long since I've worn the Jakesuit. I forgot how awesome your bod is, bro. Stretchy-arm power!  I feel unstoppable!  Bam! And I don't even feel it!   BMO, throw your plate at me!
BMO|  Okay! 
Finn|  Yeah, BMO, show me the stuff, keep it coming!  Yeah, BMO, unleash the beast!
BMO|  Yah! Unleash the beast! 
Finn|  Come on, BMO, bring it, that's nothing!   You're weak, BMO!
Finn|  You OK, BMO?
BMO|  I am no match for the Jakesuit.
Finn|  That's right!
Finn|  Dog, the Jakesuit is mad strong! This junk could protect me from anything!
Jake|   Uh, sorta. Wait, bro, what are you doing up here? You know I'm not actual armor, right?
Finn|  Septuple flip off the tree house! 
Jake|  Nooo!
Finn|  Ride 'em cowboy! Woo!
Jake|  You were a little rough with the Jakesuit today, bro. You mashed up my doggy bag pretty hard.
Finn|  Why didn't you stop me?
Jake|  When you're in my body, it pushes out my brain, so I have no control.
Finn|  C'mon bro, taking pain is easy. You just have to imagine that every bruise is a hickey from the Universe. And everyone wants to get with the Universe. 
Jake|  I bet you wouldn't be saying that nonsense if I wore you as a suit.
Finn|  I bet I would be saying that nonsense.
Jake|  OK bro, let's see how you like it. I'll bring the pain!
Finn|  Do it bro, get in here!
Jake|  Haha yes! Time to bring the pain!
Jake|  Eh?
Finn|   Man, are you kidding?
Jake|  You give up?
Finn|  You have to like, punch me in the face.
Jake|  Hmm. I thought I was. This is hard. I can't even make a fist. How do you control my body so well?
Finn|  Dude, I'm graceful. Mom raised me graceful.
Finn|   Dude, what the Bjork?
Jake|  A-ha! Here we go! Dream Journal of a Boring Man, Volume 12.
Finn|  Uh, Jake, what are you doing?
Jake|  There's all kinds of pain, Finn.
Finn|  Dude, come on, don't do this.
Jake|"  Ah. Okay, let's see. Ooh, this one looks good. And it's not too long, only seven pages!  Okay, here we go.   ""In my dream, I was eating jasmine rice. But it was also brown rice. And it was also my mother."""
Jake|  Huh? Where am I?  Oh, yeah. Hey, Finn, how long have I been out?
Finn|  I don't know. A couple hours
Jake|  Say what?! Why are you still reading?
Finn|"  It's actually not that bad. There's a bunch where he knows he's dreaming. Here, let me read you a little.  ""So I said to the first guy, if everyone in my dream is me, then you are me. And he said, I am who? And I said, me. And he said, who is me? And I said, you.  And he said, what about you? And I said, no you!""  It's like he's trying to solve a mystery that doesn't exist! You want me to keep going?"
Jake|  No, I'm hungry.
Finn|  Yeah, I'm hungry too. How about a truce while you go make us some lunch?
Jake|  Oh, I didn't know we were allowed to call truces. I'll totally remember that the next time my doggy bag is hurtling towards a fence post.
Finn|  You know, you could use the opportunity of cooking me food to mess with me.
Jake|   Wait a sec, you just gave me an idea!
Finn|  Yeah?  Uh-oh. Oh, look out, you gonna make me something gross? Soemthing spicy? You know I can take it! 
Jake|  Ta-da!
Finn|  Meatloaf? That's my favorite dish.
Jake|  Mmm-mmm.
Finn|  What did you do to it?
Jake|  I assure you, it's delicious.
Finn|  Okay, well, you're really terrible at this. 
Jake|  Yummy!
Finn|  Oh, that's just mean.
Jake|  Admit you're wrong, and you can have some of this delicious meatloaf!
Finn|  Nah, I'm good.
Finn|  Jake, it's my special occasion phone! Someone's calling me to tell me about a special occasion.
Jake|  So?
Finn|  So can you walk me over there? I wanna see who it is!  Oh, it's Flame Princess.  I'll talk to her later. I don't want you embarrassing me or, uh, anything. Jake?
Finn|  Jake! Seriously, don't do this!
Jake|  Tell me I win, dude!
Finn|  No, absolutely not.
Jake|  Alright. Say goodbye to Flame Princess thinking you're cool! I'm gonna embarrass the Bjork outta you!
Flame Princess|  Oh, hey, you came! I got worried because you didn't answer special occasion phone. My relatives are waiting inside.
Finn|  What?
Flame Princess|  Well, that's why I called on special occasion phone. All my less-evil family members are here for dinner. Come eat!
Flame Princess|  Finn, this is my family.  These are my two younger brothers, my brother who's home from the military, and my judgmental aunt and uncle. 
Finn|   Jake, whatever you're about to do, please don't do it.
Older brother|  What are you doing in front of my family?!
Flame Princess|  Hold on, bro. Perhaps it is a non-flameish custom unknown to us.
Jake|   Nope! Just doin' the kind of stuff I do all the time!
Older brother|  This is a nightmare come true for me, sister.
Flame Princess|  What are you doing?!
Jake|   Don't you wanna see more?
Flame Princess|  Oh, my Bjork! No! I don't want to see more! Wait, what's that in your mouth? Jake?
Jake|   Oops! Busted.
Flame Princess|  Are you controlling Finn?
Jake|  Yeah, I'm causing Finn pain. We have a bet going on.
Flame Princess|  And you made him dance like a baby, semi-nude, in front of my family? Wow, that's pretty hardcore.
Jake|   What?
Flame Princess|  Good luck, Finn. Hope you win!
Finn|  I will!
Jake|  Hmm!
Lady Rainicorn|   Finn! Oh, of all days! Where are you going? Jake, where are you?
Jake|  I'm right here.
Lady Rainicorn|   Oh!
T.V.|  'Sup?
Jake|  What's T.V. doing here? I thought all the kids found apartments.
Lady Rainicorn|  No matter what, I think he's stay-at-home.
Jake|  Ha-ha! That's my boy. Momma's basement baby. 
Lady Rainicorn|   Jake, what are you doing? Please tell me.
Jake|  Oh, it's this bet we're doing. It's not really a bet. It's more like a showdown. I'm trying to get him to admit that it's hard when someone wears you as a suit. How do I win the bet, Lady?
T.V.|  Hey, Dad? Why don't you try jumping in a volcano? 
Jake|  Yes!
Finn|  So, what are we doing, bro? 
Jake|  The Universe is going to have a full-on make-out session with you, bro. I'm talkin' minimum tier 8. Behold!
Finn|  Fire Wolves? That's your plan? Please.
Jake|  Oh no, bro, that's just fortuitous circumstance!  Allow me to take advantage! here, pup pups! Want some kibble? Want steak flavor? Steaky-steaks?
Jake|  How you like it, bro? Pretty painful, huh?
Finn|  Eh, whatev.
Finn|  Hmm. Looks hot.
Jake|  Oh yeah, bro! The pain-train has arrived at the station! Choo-choo! 
Finn|  I'm ready, bro! Bring it! You're nothin', lava! You're a bum! I can handle you!
Jake|  Look, just say stop, and you won't get burned.
Finn|   Never!
Jake|  Okay, bro. This'll pretty much wreck up your whole life, so think about it.
Finn|  Bring it! Yeah, baby, feels good, love it, lovin' that heat on my skull!
Jake|  Okay...I'm gonna lower you some more...probably gonna cook up your brain.
Finn|  Oh, yeah, give it to me!
Jake|   Dang, he's flippin' crazy! This isn't gonna do anything, he's never gonna give up!
Finn|  What happened? You robbed me of the win!
Jake|  You're right, man. My bruises are hickeys from the Universe. And I should just accept that.
Finn|  Yeah boy! In yo' face!
Jake|  Yeah, in my face.
Jake|  Dangit, Finn.
Big Clown Nurse|  Who's ready for rehabilitation?
Head Clown Nurse|  We'll start with full-body immersion therapy. 
Finn|   No!
Jake|   Yes!
Jake|   Beep beep! Look out! Beep beep! Pillow delivery! Look out buddy! 
Finn|  Uuf! 
BMO|  Uuf!
Finn|  Come on, Jake...
Jake|  Sorry buddy,  just trying to cheer you up some. I mean here you are chillin' out with history's coolest friends, building an actual pillow fort, but you just sit there sulking--I mean, what gives!?
Finn|   I guess I'm just thinking about Flame Princess. I told her a joke the other day and she didn't even laugh or anything. I guess it's over between us.
Jake|  That's it?! A joke?
BMO|  Maybe she just didn't get it yet.
Finn|  Yeah right, BMO. More like she used up all her laughs on some other guy's jokes probably. Man, having a girlfriend is hard.
Jake|  No! Being crazy is hard. You're getting all hung up, all hung up on imaginary problems. You gotta focus on what's real, man.  You see this cup? This is literally my favorite cup.  Now it's gone forever. So it's not real, and I don't care about it anymore.
BMO|   Oh no! My favorite window!
Finn|  I don't even know what you guys are talking about. I think I just need some alone time.  Gotta let my mind fester a bit, you know? I'll be back in a little while. 
Jake|   Finn! Festering is always bad, man! There's no good kind of festering! Finn!
Finn|  Man, this looked smaller from the outside. What's this now? What the?! Jake, what's in here?! Jake?
Finn|  Oh, whoa!  Did Jake build this part too? That guy needs some more girlfriends or something.
Finn|   Hey Jake! You need more girlf--what the...? Door's gone?
Finn|  Hmm, maybe there's another door in yonder pillow town.  I don't get this at all.
Pillow children|  Dragon!! Blanket Dragon! Run!
Finn|  Huh?
Pillow child|   Oof! Hey mistah, you betta get wunnin'! Bwanket Dwagon!
Finn|  Now this, I understand!    Oh. That's it?
Pillow child|  Wow.
Pillow people|   Did you see that?
Finn|  Hey, uh, how's it going?
Quilton|  Puhoy there! I am Quilton, son of Pillowford, and you have saved our village! You and your sharp pillow.
Finn|  Hah, it's nothing; I kill things all the time.
Quilton|  Oh, nonsense! This calls for a celepillowbration!
Pillow people|  
Finn|  
Roselinen|  There you are, Finn the Human.
Finn|  Oh, hey there... Um, you can just call me Finn if you want.
Roselinen|  All right, Finn. My name is Roselinen, daughter of Quilton. You have to call me the whole thing.
Finn|  Oh, uh...
Roselinen|  Just kidding!
Finn|  Heh. Oh, uh, your dad seems fun.
Quilton|  Oh, ha ha, oh my! Puhzah!
Roselinen|   Yeah. Um, you wanna dance?
Finn|  Oh, well...  I...have a girlfriend. 
Roselinen|    Dummy, it's a dance, not marriage.
Finn|   Yeah, okay!  This place is weird.
Roselinen|   Are you telling me that birds in your world don't poo little pillowcases?
Finn|  Naah, just regular poo.
Roselinen|  Hey, like this. 
Finn|  Eh, yeah, i-it's really cool. Where I come from, I live with my best friend, who's my brother. And he's a dog. We fight stuff; it's cool. It's really different than here. I mean, where I'm from, blankets and pillows are used for bedding.
Roselinen|   Well they're used for that here too.
Finn|   Heh heh uh.
Quilton|  Woo oo ooh hoo hoo! Pill-ightful!
Finn|  Ah man, it's been nice, Roselinen. But I gotta get back to my home.  Quilton, I need your help to find a portal to my home world.
Quilton|  Of course, we will do our best to help you, Finn the Flesh Pillow. But you're not making a fold of sense!
Quilton|  Please, share our food. You need nourishment.
Finn|    It tastes... like... a pillow...
Quilton|  I'll give your compliments to the pillow.
BMO|  Oh, there you are! You found your mug. I thought you said you didn't care.
Jake|  
BMO|  That mug is empty.
Jake|  I wonder what Finn's up to...
Jay|   Roar! I'm the Blanket Dragon!!
Bonnie|   Well, I'm daddy! Sha-pow!
Roselinen|  Jay, Bonnie. I bet your dad's just about finished chopping wool. You guys wanna bring him his lunch?
Jay & Bonnie|  Yes!
Finn|    Alphanumeric!  Pillow sheep! You have more fluff than sense! 
Jay & Bonnie|  Daddy!
Finn|  Oh!  What is this!  A pack of fearsome pillow goblins?!
Bonnie|   Ha ha, daddy, we're your kids!
Roselinen|  Psst, Finn, they've brought you lunch.
Finn|  Oh, they have, have they?  Tiny pillows. Mmm mmm mm mmm.
Jay|  
Finn|   Darling, you've outdone yourself.
Quilton|   Honk, honk!
Jay & Bonnie|  Grandpillow!
Roselinen|  What's my father doing here?
Quilton|  Puhoy!
Jay & Bonnie|  Grandpillow!
Quilton|  Oh oh oh, come here! Oh, but I've come to speak with your father.
Finn|  What is it, Quilton?
Quilton|  When you first arrived here, you told us of a mysterious door that led you to our world.
Finn|  Yes, of course.
Quilton|  Archaeologists found this in the Pillow Catacombs  The Pillownomicon.
Finn|  Oh my glob.
Quilton|  There is no information about the door, save for the fact it shows up periodically, and then disappears.
Finn|  Quilton, I need to find that door. 
Jake|  Uhhh, hey BMO, I gotta snag my mug from you. 
BMO|  Oh, really?
Jake|  Hey don't sweat it, I'll make us some hot chocolate.
BMO|  Jake, you drive a hard burger.
Finn|   Hello?
Rasheeta|  Ah yes, come in.
Finn|  Are these The Great Abracadabra Mountains? And are you Rasheeta the Great Oracle, dweller of said mountains?
Rasheeta|  Yes, you must be Finn the Human Man, seeker of the wandering portal.
Finn|  Yes, I've searched for decades--how did you know?
Rasheeta|  I've read it in the Tea Leaves,  this newspaper I found from the future.
Finn|  Does it say how I get home?
Rasheeta|  The real question is are you sure you want to?
Finn|  Uh... yeah!
Rasheeta|  Well don't worry, you won't be here long. 
Finn|  So there is another way to...  Oof...
Rasheeta|  Not long now. 
Finn|  Oh... 
Bonnie|  Father?
Jay|  What did the oracle say, father? Have we come to the right spot finally?
Finn|  I think so, but the oracle spoke in riddles.  Gonna have to fester on this one for a bit...
Roselinen|  Oh, Finn. I know you have to go, all these years I've known, but now that it's time...  Oh man, I'm just all messed up about it. Just promise me you'll remember us,  when you're back in your real life.
Finn|  Hmm, that reminds me, Roselinen, of something Jake told me just before I came to this world.
Jake|   You're getting all hung up on imaginary problems, stay with your new wife. You've known her longer now than any of us. You're not even sure if I ever really existed. And I'm pretty sure I didn't look like this.
Finn|   Man. How did he see it all coming so clearly?  Come on, everyone. Pack your things, we're going home.
BMO|   Ha ha he, ha ha he, goodness, Jake, why don't you do this with your other babies?
Jake|  Well, Rainicorn babies age rapidly. They don't need their parents a couple hours after they're born.
BMO|  That really stinks, huh?
Jake|  Mmmmm.
BMO|  Hot chocolate is ready!
Roselinen|  Finn... Finn.
Finn|   Wha—where?
Roselinen|  Are you comfortable?
Finn|  I'm... alright.
Bonnie|  Um, dad...  dad. We.. just.. wanted to say... that we-- 
Jay|    That... we love you dad.
Finn|   I remember... back... when I was dad.
Jay|   Dad, you are dad...
Finn|   I ain't dad yet! Oh, no, wait! Here it comes! Woo hoo hoo hoo hooooo, BOY! 
Finn|  HUP! 
Jake|  Hey buddy, you feeling better already?
Finn|  Huh? Oh. Uhh, I don't know, man. I just had the number one wildest dream.
Jake|  Really?
Finn|  Yeah! I was--  Hello? Oh hey! Oh.  Yeah, thanks! Yeah, okay, bye.  That was Flame Princess. She said she didn't get my joke until just now and that it's really funny and awesome!
BMO|   . Ha ha! I knew it!
Jake|  Yeah, that's great man. Now what about this dream?
Finn|  What dream?
Jake|  The dream you were just talking about.
Finn|  Huh?
Jake|  Just a second ago!
Finn|  
Jake|  The dream you just had in the pillow fort!
Finn|   Pfft!
Jake|  Oh man! Alright, what's next?
Finn|  Haha, let's see...  First we visit Tree Trunks for apple pie, and then we go to Bubblegum's science music thing!
Jake|  Wait, what about the movie at the drive-in?
Finn|  That's after we make dream sandwiches!
Jake|  Whoo!  Let's go, apple pie!
Finn|   Whoo!
Finn|   Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks|   Huh?
Jake|  TT!
Finn|  Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks|  Oh my, look who's here! Yoo-hoo! 
Jake|  Oh yeah!
Tree Trunks|  Howdy, Jake! Howdy, Finn!
Mr. Pig|  Hello!
Jake|  What'cha ya doin' here?
Mr. Pig|  I never really left.
Tree Trunks|  Mr. Pig's been so kind helpin' me, hehe, tend to my rose garden.
Finn & Jake|  Hmmm.
Finn|  Cool.
Jake|  Cool cool.
Mr. Pig|  Cool cool cool.
Tree Trunks|  Cool cool cool cool!
Mr. Pig|  Oh, you.
Finn|  Where's the apple pie, Tree Trunks?
Jake|  Yeah, my stomach is jonesin' for it bad! 
Tree Trunks|  Oh, you all are so early that I haven't even started! 
Mr. Pig|   I love her so much.
Finn|  WHOA! You love 'er?!
Mr. Pig|  Whaa? No!
Finn|   You just said you love 'er.
Mr. Pig|   You're crazy.
Jake|  Dude, come on, we heard you.
Mr. Pig|   I think I am in love with her! But I don't know how to go about it... 
Finn|  Dude, you should just tell her how you feel!
Mr. Pig|   Phew...
Tree Trunks|  There you are, what are you boys chattin' about? Hmmm?
Mr. Pig|  Uh-huh, alright okay...  Ms. Tree Trunks... Ma'am, today, I wish to speak my feelings.
Tree Trunks|  Mr. Pig, what's going on?
Tree Trunks|  Ohhhhh!
Mr. Pig|   Mmmm, that's good.
Tree Trunks|  Shush. I feel the same. I have a feeling that this is the feeling others call... love.  What should we do then?
Mr. Pig|  We should hug. 
Jake|  Tree Trunks... you gonna bring some pie to Princess Bubblegum's thing?
Tree Trunks|  Uh... Yeah, Jake, yeah! 
Jake|  Well... Okay...  See you later then.
Finn|  
Jake|   Where is she? 
Finn|  You givin' me a back rub, bro?
Jake|  What?  Yeah, yeah, yeah...  Is that-?!  It's Tree Trunks!
Jake|  Pie! Pie!!  Lay it right here. 
Tree Trunks|  Oh Jake, I tried to bake an apple pie, but this cutie kept distracting me. 
Jake|  No apple pie?!
Jam Jam|   This is making me uncomfortable...
Cinnamon Bun|  They're snuggling too loud!
Another Candy Person|  What's happening? I forgot my glasses!
Princess Bubblegum|  Huh? Oh, gross!
Finn|  Hyeah! Break it up, break it up! Okay, the love show is over! Princess, please continue.
Princess Bubblegum|  Hm! 
Jam Jam|  Ah! Ah! This is too much!  It's driving me crazy!
Princess Bubblegum|  Cinnamon Bun, do something!
Cinnamon Bun|  ...Okay. Hey everyone! The concert is over!
Princess Bubblegum|  That's not what I-
Cinnamon Bun|  The concert's over, Princess!
Tree Trunks|  Princess, how's about a slow song so me and my man can dance cheek to cheek. 
Princess Bubblegum|  Hm! 
Tree Trunks|  Why's everybody givin' me the hairy eyeball?
Finn|  Y'all are too affectionate. It makes people feel... bothered when you and the Pig your affection in public!
Tree Trunks|  They don't want us to flaunt what we have?
Finn|  You two need to hide your love... or else, you'll end up making the whole world throw up!
Mr. Pig and Tree Trunks|  We promise to keep our affection hidden.
Finn|  Thank you.
Jake|  Have you seen my other shoe?
Finn|  I think I saw it in the closet!
Jake|  Ahhh! Under my shoe?! Outta here!
Candy Mother|  This carriage is for babies!  For babies!!
Finn|  Nice stacks of sandwiches!
Jake|   You shouldn'ta bought so many flavors! I had to make a sandwich for each flavor, and for each flavor combination!
Finn|  I'm makin' a cheese sandwich!  Tree Trunks! Pig! Come on!
Tree Trunks|  We're trying to hide our love, but it's so difficult!
Jake|   Try harder!
Finn|   Doesn't look like Tree Trunks and Pig are around!
Jake|  Yeah, looks like the cost is clear!
Gingerbread Actor|   Look at this cup!  Now, look at this cup! Look at this one! 
Jake|  Aw, man!
Finn|   Just try to ignore it and watch the movie!
Jake|  I can't ignore that! 
Jake|  Stoooooop!
Finn|  Tree Trunks, this has gone on long enough! No more spending time with the Pig, unless you do it, inside your own home.
Tree Trunks|  But Finn, an unmarried couple living together one roof, that's undecent!
Finn|  Then, why don't you two just get married?
Tree Trunks|  We don't wanna rush things-
Mr. Pig|  Uh... marriage is a big step.
Tree Trunks|  -we need time to get to know each other.
Finn|  Then I guess we only have one option.
Finn|  Alright. 
Mr. Pig|  You can't do this! Wait
Tree Trunks|  Nooo!
Mr. Pig|  Stop!
Candy Person|  Take 'em away!
Tree Trunks|  Sweet meat!
Mr. Pig|  Little dove!
Finn|   Sorry, Tree Trunks.
Jake|   So... where do you live?
Mr. Pig|   I'm homeless.
Jake|  Oh...
Mr. Pig|  I guess I'll just go back to eating criminals.  I miss her...
Tree Trunks|  I don't know what I'm going to do without him, Finn!
Finn|  Why don't you make apple pie to take your mind off of it?
Tree Trunks|   Dream of love... Is it really over? Can I overcome these tears? I close my eyes, feel that he's still with me. Still standing with me here...
Mr. Pig|  Dream of love... Are we truly parted? Must this Pig forever walk alone? In my dreams, our love is just a dream to me... but in my heart, it lives and breaths and grows.
Tree Trunks|   And even though, we ain't allowed to be together. I cross my heart and promise to be true.
Mr. Pig|  Well, I'm still lovin' you, girl, from halfway 'cross this great, big, world!  And in my dreams, I'm holding hands with yoooooooooooou!
Tree Trunks & Mr. Pig|  Dream of love... Dream of love...  It's only a dream of loooooove. Dream of love... Dream of loooooooove, it's only a dream... of love.
Tree Trunks|   I close my eyes, and feel his arms around me, in my dreams... he's not so far away.
Finn|   Go to him.
Jake|   Go.
Mr. Pig|  
Jam Jam|  I'm freaking out!!
Finn|  You know what? I like it. It's nice.
Jake|  Yeah.
Jake|  Mmmm, apple pie I've been waiting to kiss you all day! 
Finn|  Just about done.
Jake|  Mm, oh boy.
Finn|  How much Softy Cheesy for ya deezy? A little? A lot?
Jake|  Blech! None!
Finn|  But you used to love Softy Cheese!
Jake|  I don't wanna talk about it.
Finn|  What was that?
Jake|  Probably an owl.  Mm... Mm, mm...  A ghost!!
Finn|  Dude. It's just Ghost Princess. Hey, GP.   She's weird, huh?  How's it goin'?
Jake|  Are you haunting us?
Ghost Princess|  Yeeeeessss...
Jake|  Oh, okay.
Finn|   Well, could ya knock it off??
Ghost Princess|  Sorry... It's just... I'm doomed to haunt this mortal plane...
Jake|  Oh. Well, let's hear more about that, honey.
Ghost Princess|  Until I discover the cause of my death, my soul can't ascend to the 50th Dead World. But as a ghost, I have no memory of my mortal life... and no idea how I died...
Finn|   It's a crime case!
Jake|  Whoa, step back, nephew. We don't know she was moidered!
Finn|  That's right. We don't even know how she was moida'd, but I'm the hard-boiled sleuth who's gonna crack your case wiiiide open!
Ghost Princess|  OH! That sounds wonderful!
Ghost Princess|  This way, gentlemen!
Jake|  Whoa. Your neighborhood is... uh... very peaceful.
Ghost Princess|  It's the cradle of my despair...
Jake|   Right, right.
Ghost Princess|  Well... here's me.
Finn|"  Our first clue!  ""Female."" It's a good start, but we need more. Jake, it's time to interrogate the neighbors. We'll do it good cop bad cop style. I CALL BAD COP!"
Jake|  Awww...
Finn|  Yo, ghost! Yo, yo! Yo, wake up, fool! Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
Boilbee|  What?!?!
Finn|  Yo, ghost, whaddaya know about the lady buried next to you?
Boilbee|  What, you mean her?  She's been here longer than almost anybody!
Ghost Princess|  He's right...! 
Boilbee|  And don't think I don't see what you do, Ghost Princess.
Ghost Princess|  What...?
Boilbee|  Sneakin' off at night, scarin' peeps, hauntin' at all hours... 'cause you can't deal with your issues!
Clarence|  Leave her be, Boilbee.
Boilbee|  Whaaat?
Clarence|  A princess deserves empathy, not your sass. 
Boilbee|  Nyeee... nyeee... Butt out, Clarence!
Clarence|  Some of us still want to feel, you know? The vital...  ...magnetism of life.  The vibrating energies that connect all living and... nonliving beings.
Boilbee|  Nyaaargh! I don't like your words! Arrrgh... 
Ghost Princess|   I'm Ghost Princess. Have we met before? I feel like we have.
Clarence|  I don't think so, m'lady, but I am honorèd.
Finn|  Whadda you know about Ghosty-pees gettin' murdle-lurdled?
Clarence|  Sorry, I don't know anything. I can't imagine anyone who would harm someone as beautiful as this. 
Jake|  Whoa. Smooth.
Clarence|  Did you try looking yonder?  That's where the ne'er-do-well ghosts hang out.
Finn|  Right... Ne'er-do-wellers. Let's do this, Jake.
Jake|   You stay, and eat cheese puffs!
Finn|  Geez. Look at this place. It's all bunked up.
Jake|  Yeah, no wonder this is where the ne'er-do-wells go when they deezy. I got a feelin' these ghosts are gonna be harder to shake than Boilbee.
Finn|  Yeah, well get ready, 'cause this biz is gonna get ridonk.
Jake|  Cool, man. Hey, can I be bad cop now?
Finn|  No. Okay, let's check this guy out.
Jake|  What's it say?
Finn|"   ""Some donkus."" WAKE UP, DONKUS! WE GOT QUESTIONS! DINGUS! TIME TO SING, YA CANARY!  BAM!! YAH!  What'chu know about Ghost Princess, huh?! Give it up, Dungus!"
Jake|  Hey, man, take it easy.
Finn|   You do your job, I do mine!  TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW, PUNK!! Uh-oh.  What's this? A busted knife. Is this your knife, bro? TELL ME!!!  Jake, good cop...
Jake|  Alright. Cool off, bad cop!  This ghost ain't home, man!
Finn|   Well, you're lucky my partner's here... pal.
Jake|  He's not worth it, man.
Finn|   These ghosts think I'm playin'. They think it's all a big game. But you know what? You know what I'm gonna do?
Jake|  What?
Finn|  I'm gonna turn this game... UP-SIDE-DOWN!!! 
Ghost Princess|  So, you really don't know how you died either?
Clarence|  Of course not.  Two, please.  And we might never find out, but that's okay because right now, in this moment, I'm feeling pretty sweetles, you know?
Ghost Princess|  I feel... sweetles also in this moment also.
Clarence|  That's great, Ghost Princess. I'm glad we can feel this way together, in the face of uncertainty.
Ghost Announcer|  Llllladies and gents! The center for Ghost Community Outreach and ghostdates.com present... SPIRIT WAVES!
Clarence|  More beautiful than I could imagine.
Ghost Princess|  Are you talking about Spirit Waves...?
Clarence|  I'm talking... about you, Princess.
Finn|  YYYYAAAAAH!!  GHOSTS! YOU GHOSTS! COME OUT! 
Jake|  I think this place is abandoned, man.
Finn|  They're just hidin' 'cause they know they're guilty!
Muscular Ghost 1|  Yo! Yo! That's my grave! Why're you fops trashin' our spot?!
Finn|   We thought you were... hiding.
Muscular Ghost 2|  Dude. We were at the Spirit Waves show.
Muscular Ghost 3|  Kill these fools!
Finn|  BRING IT ON, YOU MAMAS!
Clarence|  Hold up! These guys are with me.
Muscular Ghost 3|  ...A'ight, Clarence, but only because of that one time when I did that thing by accident and you were cool about it.
Muscular Ghost 1|  It's your lucky day, punks.
Jake|  Phew! Thanks, Clarence!
Finn|  Yo, I'm sorry we haven't solved the case yet.
Ghost Princess|  It's alright, Finn... I'm calling off the investigation.
Finn|  What? Why?
Ghost Princess|  I don't feel tormented anymore now that I'm with Clarence.
Finn|  Oh. That's... that's cool.
Ghost Princess|  It's hard to explain, but it's like we already know each other.
Clarence|  I feel it, too. Our spirits must be intwined in the cosmic wheel of time.
Jake|  Nice!
Clarence|  Let's go to my private mausoleum where we can be... private. 
Finn|  Yugh!
Ghost Princess|   Thanks for your help...!
Finn|  A'ight.   Man... I wanted to crack the case, y'know?
Jake|  Look on the bright side, guy! We looted all this sweet grave booty! Ka-ching! 
Finn|  Jake! You looted?! That's bad, man! You're supposed to be good cop.
Jake|  Oops... I didn't know it was wrong.
Finn|  Come on, let's put all this stuff back.
Jake|  What?! All of it?!
Finn|"  Yes, Jake.  Huh. This dagger says, ""Rence."""
Jake|  What's that?
Finn|  I guess some donkus's real name was...  ReeeeEEEENCE?!!
Ghost Princess|  Have we met before?
Ghost Princess|  It's hard to explain, but it's like we already know each other.
Finn|  Is this your knife, bro?
Jake|  This ghost ain't home, man.
Jake|  What is it, dude??
Finn|   ...We gotta dig up the princess.
Finn|"  Look!  Sorry.  Lookit!  ""Cla-rence."" Clarence was some donkus!"
Jake|  Some donkus skee-bopped Ghost Princess!!
Jake|  STOP!
Finn|  Clarence is your murdler!
Clarence|  Warrior Princess! Give up your kingdom!
Warrior Princess|  Never! Not even to you, my love!!  Aaagh...  Clarence... I--... 
Clarence|  My love...  NOOOOOO!!! 
Clarence|  I... did it?
Ghost Princess|  I forgive you, Clarence! Take my hands! Ascend with me to the 50th Dead Wooorld...!
Clarence|  I can't! My soul is stuck! I have to know how I died! Oh, Glob... My life is like a fart.
Jake|  Whoa, wait a minute. Say that again!
Clarence|  MY LIFE IS LIKE A FART!!!
Jake|  I know you, man! From the Squeez-E-Mart!
Clarence|  Huh? Uh... Squeez-E-Mart? I'm starting to remember!   I was a broken man.
Clarence|  More.
Tonya|  Think you've had enough, man.
Clarence|  I don't care. My life is like a fart.
Jake|  Huh?
Clarence|   My life is like a fart! 
Tonya|  HEY! HEY, STOP THAT!
Jake|  CITIZEN'S ARREST!  Hey, be careful, man!!
Finn|  So that's why you don't like Softy Cheese!
Ghost Princess|  Claaareeence!!!
Clarence|  Ghost Princess!!!
Jake|  Congratulations, you kids!
Finn|  Haha, yeah!
Ghost Princess|   Goodbyyye...! Thanks for everything!
Clarence|   Thanks for everything! Goodbye!
Finn|  You sure you're ready for this, man?
Jake|  Yeah. Gimme one a' them cheesy dogs, man.
Finn|  All gone?  Lemme see. Move your tongue left...
Jake|   Wah-vah.
Finn|  ...And right.
Jake|   Vah.
Finn|  I'm proud of you, pal. Real proud.
Finn|  Well, looks like your new house is done.  Whoop! Jake! You wanna check out the new house?
Jake|  Naah,  don't let me interrupt you. You two have fun.
Flame Princess|   I wanna see inside!   I love it! 
Finn|  Great!   This doesn't hurt as bad as it used to.   Oh gob! Oh gob! Oh gob! 
Jake|   Finn!
Finn|  Haha, I'm okay!
Flame Princess|   Hmmmm...
Finn|  
Flame Princess|  Oh!  Do the thing that I like.
Finn|   
Flame Princess|  
Jake|   Now do the thing I like.
Finn|   
Jake|  Hehehe, classic.  Alright Finn, that's enough. 
Flame Princess|  Thank you for building my new home, Finn. I'm so happy.
Finn|   You... wanna hug?
Flame Princess|  Yes.
Jake|"  Woah! Hold on ""mama."""
Jake|   Okay bro, tin foil's on. You can hug now.
Jake|  
Finn|  Bye.
Flame Princess|   Bye, Finn.
Finn|   Bye! 
Flame Princess|  
Jake|  Looks like your date went pretty good buddy.
Finn|  Uh... I don't know, was the hug okay? Give me some tips man.
Jake|  Bro, you gotta let things take their natural path. Look, look , let me explain some junk about dating. Right now, , you're at Tier 1, which is hugging. But pretty soon,  you'll be at Tier 2, which is smooching. Then down the road , you'll make it to Tier 5, where she'll let you discover all fifteen feet of her loong, beautiful stomach. Then after awhile, you'll make it to Tier 8 , where you touch her horn for the very first time. Very special.
Finn|    What about Tier 15?
Jake|   You stay away from that! Do not do Tier 15!
Finn|   Dude, I got no idea what you're talking about.
Jake|   Don't worry about it dude, just let things naturally move to Tier 2. Oh and um, you need a shower dude.
Finn|  What?!    Oh gross.
Finn|  Do you think Flame Princess could smell me?
Jake|  Probably.
Finn|  Crup.
Princess Bubblegum| 'Sup, guys?
Finn and Jake|  Princess Bubblegum?!
Jake|  What are you doing here?
Princess Bubblegum|  Collecting taxes, you guys weren't home. So I let myself in.
Jake|  Oh.
Finn|  I'm gonna take a shower. Princess, do not inhale!
Princess Bubblegum|  What? Why?
Finn|  Just don't.  Hyap!
Princess Bubblegum|  What's that all about?
Jake|  Aah, he's just smelly from a day of running around with his lady-friend.
Princess Bubblegum|   Ooh, a lady-friend, do tell.
Jake|  Uh, I shouldn't say. It's his business.
Princess Bubblegum|   Oh, come on, you can tell me.
Jake|  That's his personal biz, you gotta respect the man's p-biz.
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, you're right, I'll respect it.
Jake|  Flame Princess! He's hanging out with Flame Princess!
Princess Bubblegum|   What?!
Jake|  And I don't mean to be telling stories out of school. But pretty soon,  they're gonna be taking it to Tier 2.
Princess Bubblegum|  No, this isn't possible.
Jake|  Oh, it's possible.
Princess Bubblegum|  I just never thought, Flame Princess. I-uh-I have to go.
Princess Bubblegum|  Morrow!
Morrow|  
Jake|   Mmm, weird.
BMO|   Guess who's late for their video chat. 
Jake|   President Porpoise!
President Porpoise|  
Princess Bubblegum|   No, no.  Oh gob, I thought I'd be ready for this.
Finn|  Yyyaawn!  Whoop. Jake, I'm going to see Flame Princess, be back later. 
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn!
Finn|  
Jake|  Ok Princess, you need to stop breaking in here.
Princess Bubblegum|  I have something important to tell you. About relationships.
Finn|  Ah, that's okay, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum|  I just hope, you'll understand.  Relationships  are like layers of sedimentary rock.......
Finn|  Jake, Flame Princess is waiting for me. I'm gonna bounce out.
Jake|  Uh, ok,  Tier 2 baby!
Finn|  Word. 
Princess Bubblegum|  If too much frustration builds, the magma will erupt causing a catastrophic super-stratum of igneous rock to form......
Jake|  What? Where am I?
Mini-snowman|  Jake, you're president now!
Jake|  Oh my glosh! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Jake!
Jake|  
Princess Bubblegum|  Wake up!
Jake|  
Princess Bubblegum|  Jake, where's Finn?
Jake|  He stepped out.
Princess Bubblegum|  Will you tell him why he can't see Flame Princess anymore?
Jake|  Oh, oh!  I see what's going on here!
Princess Bubblegum|  Great! I cannot stress how important it is that they not see each other. 
Jake|  Oh man, PB is totally jealous of Flame Princess!
BMO| Jump, punch, kick, kick!
Jake|  What's up man?
Finn|  Yo, dude! So what did Princess Bubblegum want?
Jake|  She doesn't want you see Flame Princess anymore. She's crazy jealous!
Finn|  
Jake|  So, you at Tier 2 yet?
Finn|   I got about five hugs, does that count?
Jake|  Nnoope.
Finn|   Uhaah.. Well, I'm still at Tier 1.
Jake|"  I know exactly what'll get you Tier 2.... A ""sappy poem."" "
Jake|"  Say something about her ""spectrum."""
Finn|  Ee-eww! Let's see.... She's bright. She's beautiful. She makes me feel... confused, l-like something's filling up my chest, like I can't breathe, is it because she's so.. dangerous? Glob, Jake, I can't stand it! 
Jake|  
Finn|  Inspiration... 
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn!
Finn|  
Princess Bubblegum|  Whatcha doin'?
Finn|  Oh, uh, hi, Princess. I'm, uhh, writing something for Jake.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, well, speaking of Jake. Did he explain everything to you?
Finn|  Yyeah.
Princess Bubblegum|  And you understand?
Finn|   Yeah, I understand.
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, sometimes you want someone and you  want to kiss them, and be with them. But you can't, because responsibility demands sacrifice.
Finn|   What are you trying to say?!
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm trying to say that you're a hero, Finn. You're my hero. So, I'm glad you understand why you can't be with Flame Princess.
Finn|   Grr... Bubblegum! I can't do this anymore!
Princess Bubblegum|  What?
Finn|  Now you like me?!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, what are you talking about?
Finn|  What am I talking about?!  PB, I was.... geh...eh..  I was in love with you! Okay?! And you didn't love me back! Now I'm ready to move on, and it's like...rrmph!! You're gonna build me up all over again! Well, I'm done! I'm done. 
Princess Bubblegum|   Oh, no!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn! Jake, where's Finn? Is he with Flame Princess?
Jake|"   Back off, Bubblegum! That's his ""man's biz."""
Princess Bubblegum|  Is he with her?!  Or not?!
Jake|   You heartless monster! Do you have any idea how much he's CRIED OVER YOU? Finn deserves to be happy, even if his blooping face gets burned off!  You should be  ashamed!  You're SICK! 
Princess Bubblegum|  What are you..? This isn't about some  petty love triangle! Flame Princess is physically unstable!  Her elemental matrix can't handle extreme romance! Glob, if Finn tries to kiss her, she'll burn so hot, she'll melt right through the planet's crust, down through the molten core, then she'll be thrown back and forth by gravity until she burns out the world from the inside! Why do you think I had her father keep her locked up?!
Jake|  
Princess Bubblegum|  Will you take me to them?
Princess Bubblegum|  Faster!
Finn|   Your wavelengths are my weakness, your emissions are what I've been missing. 
Finn and Flame Princess|  
Flame Princess|  Ahhh.
Princess Bubblegum|  No!
Finn|   Ohhhh-uh, Flame Princess! 
Finn|  FLAME PRINCESS!
Jake|   Finn!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, there's no time! You have to...
Jake|  Are you alright?
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn!
Jake|  
Finn|   Ohhh-tsst. Flame Princess!
Jake|   It's hot!
Princess Bubblegum|  Wait, wait! Don't move. This is good! If you stay on the hole for 24.8 seconds, the reaction will be deprived of oxygen.  She'll go out.
Jake|   Geh.. What about Finn?
Finn|  Hey!  What's wrong? Please, say something.  Please...  I need you...  to be okay. 
Flame Princess|  Huh, ummm. 
Finn|   Are you okay?
Flame Princess|  I'm okay. I'm okay.
Princess Bubblegum|   She's stabilized. We're safe... for now.
Finn|   
Flame Princess|   
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, Finn.
Jake|  
Princess Bubblegum|   What?
Jake|   Jeeeaalous?
Princess Bubblegum|  Shut up.
Jake|  Alright. Whaddaya wanna see next?
Finn|  A cheetah! A fart!
BMO|  A cookie! An external hard drive! Ooh, ooh! Change into Finn, but give him my body!
Finn|  BMO, your ideas are boring.
BMO|  What? Your head on my body isn't boring! It's weird! 
Jake| Alright, I'll try to turn into a cheetah farting.  I can't do the spots.
Finn|  Sparkles on the house? LET'S SQUISH 'EM!
Jake|  Did you squish the sparkles?
Finn|  No. They're around this holo-message player. It's got a cartridge with it.
Jake|  Oh, snap!  Well, plop that cartridge in the slot, playah!
Finn|  Yeah! Okay! 
Joshua|   Hello, boys. 
Finn and Jake|  Dad!!
Joshua|  If you're hearing this prerecorded hologram message, it's because I passed on, and my spirit sparkles guided you to its secret hiding place. Right now, I'm holding both of you in my hands. You're both still little squishy babies.  I made you boys something. It's a dungeon. A proper dungeon. Full of evil monsters, traps, and magic. The whole kazoo!
Finn and Jake|  Whoa! Kickin'! Kickin'!
Joshua|  Now, this next part of the message is just for you, Jake, so Finn, cover your ears.  Jake... really, this dungeon is for Finn. I know I won't be around forever, and I wanna make something that will force Finn to toughen up.
Jake|  What?!
Joshua|  Now, tell Finn to uncover his ears now.
Jake|  Dude, take your hands off your head.
Finn|  WHAT?!?!
Joshua|  Alright, boys. Now to give you some incentive, at the end of the dungeon, I'm going to put the Family Sword. It's made out of Demon's Blood.
Finn|  Whoa, what the--?!
Jake|  Whoa, dang!
Blood Demon|  Give me back my blood, Joshua!
Joshua|  Kee Oth Rama Pancake.
Blood Demon|  Waaaaah!! 
Jake|  Whoa!!
Finn|  Geez-louise!
Joshua|  The dungeon's eighty paces west of here under a dumb-lookin' rock. And Finn, this dungeon's gonna kick your tail. I bet you won't even get past the first trial, ya whiny baby!
Finn|  What?? What was that about?
Jake|  Uh... 
Dumb Rock|  Duh... duh... du-ugh... duh...
Finn|  Whoo! 
Jake|  Whoa! Burgers and hotdogs! Yeah, yeah, YEAH! 
Finn|  Wait, Jake!
Jake|   But... burgers and hotdogs..
Finn|  Didn't you say you were hungry for burgers this morning?
Jake|  Yeah, so?
Finn|  And I said I was hungry for hotdogs?
Jake|  Mm-hmm, I remember.
Finn|  I don't think those burgers and hotdogs are burgers and hotdogs at all.
Jake|  Aaaahh...
Finn|   DUDE!!  Look!
Joshua|  Finn, cover up those nubs on your head.
Finn|  Man... again? 
Joshua|  Alright. Hey, Jake, I wanna remind you what this dungeon's for.  In order for Finn to stop whining, he needs to be put through a trial that forces him to take charge of a situation.
Jake|  But Dad, Finn's already figured that out. He's a good kid with a kind heart.
Joshua|  Remember, Jake, this is a prerecorded holo-message. I can't hear you if you're talking to me right now.
Finn|   I'm gonna go walk around!
Jake|  Okay!
Joshua|  Jake, I need your help. You gotta call Finn a whiny baby.
Jake|  But—
Joshua|  Butts are for pooping! Do it for Poppy!
Jake|   Finn!
Finn|  Over here!  Check it out, Jake. I found two ways. This way has some kinda flower trap, and that way... has that guy.
Ugly Monster|  None shall pass!
Jake|  Ugh... Let's take the flower path!
Finn|   Mmm.
Ugly Monster|  Wait! Why don't you wanna take my path?!
Jake|  Because... you're super gross, man.
Ugly Monster|  Oh... 
Finn|  Cheer up, man. We're only tellin' you you're gross because we're your bros.
Ugly Monster|  Really?
Finn|  Yeah! Bros are real with each other, and you're gross, brother. Take a bath.
Ugly Monster|  Thanks, brother. Hahaha.
Finn|  Hahaha, no probs.  Hey, what did Dad say?
Jake|  Um... He said he's surprised a whiny baby like you made it this far.
Finn|  What?! Why's Dad sayin' all that jive??
Jake|  Mm...
Imaginary Joshua|  Jake, do it for Poppy! 
Jake|   Because... you cry like a baby... Baby!
Finn|  Dude... you're pickin' on me, too?
Jake|    Whoa.
Finn|  I don't even cry much. I only cry when it's healthy, like when people die.
Brown-haired witch|  Partake of the fruit... 
Finn|  Pff, blech... If I didn't cry when people died, I'd have a cold butt for a heart.
Blonde witch|  The fruuuuit...
Jake|   Waaaah, I cry when people die. Waaah, I'm Finn.
Black-haired witch|  Partake of the fruit!
Finn|   Maybe I will partake of the fruit.
Jake|  Dude, don't eat that!!
Finn|  Why not? All the people that I care about in this world are being wads.
Imaginary Joshua|  Don't you blow Poppy's cover!
Finn|  Whoa. 
Jake|  Time to go, baby.  Finn, come on!
Finn|  I'm gonna hang here. With these fruit babes. They'll be my best buds now.
Jake|  Rrrr... Yah! 
Jake|  There's another cartridge.  Alright, man, Dad told me not to tell you this, but—
Imaginary Joshua|  Don't tell 'im!
Jake|"  You're not real.  Dad asked me to call you ""Baby"" because he wants you to be tough."
Finn|  But I'm tough! My whole body is a callus!
Jake|   On this next holo-message we listen to, when Dad tells you to cover your ears, don't. 
Finn|   Hmmph.
Joshua|  Hey, hey! Finn! Jake! You made it past the fruit witches! Hey, did they make you cry, Finn? Huh? Huh?  I bet they did. Alright, now cover your ears, Sue!  Jake, I'm almost done with this dungeon. I just have one last monster to fit into this pit I dug. I got him tied up in this building. It's really hard trying to fit him into this pit. He's pretty evil. Ha.  You're gonna have a crazy time trying to defeat—  WAAAAAH!!
Finn and Jake|  DAD!
Finn|   Dad's sword!
Joshua|  Hey, Jake, when Finn finishes this dungeon, play this tape for him...
Jake|  Finn!  Dude! Use your karate biz!
Finn|  Ugh... I—  I can't, man. I suck. I'm a whiny baby, and I'm fat, and all those things Dad said about me!
Jake|  Dude... Dad loves you!
Joshua|  Finn! If you're seeing this prerecorded holo-message, it's because you finished the dungeon that I made for you. I'm proud of you. You're gonna do great things in this world. I love you, son.
Dumb Rock|  Duh... Duh...
Joshua|  I made you boys something. It's babies. Full of babies. ...the family sword. It's made out of—babies.
Jake|  You know I don't think you're a baby, right?
Finn|  Yeah. I know.
Jake|  That sword is sweet!
Finn|  Yeah! I'm stoked to slay some evil with it.
Blood Demon|  Joshua! Return my blood to me, or by demon's law, I will cut off your love handles!!!  Joshua, we go way back. Come on! Just give me back my blood!
Joshua|  Kee Oth Rama Pancake.
Blood Demon|  NOOOOOOO!!! 
Finn|  Man... Dad was cool.
Jake|  Yeah.
Starchie| Ahh! Get it off!
Finn| We're coming!
Princess Bubblegum|  Be careful!
Finn| Grab him, Jake!
Finn| Jake! W-whoa!
Finn| Whatever. 
Finn| Oh, what happened? Where's the deer? Paging Dr. Ice cream! Dr. Ice cream cream for my mouth!  Ahh, dude, I broke my stems! Hello? Jake? Princess? What the blizz. Come on, people.
Jake| Huh? Oh, Finn, you're awake!
Finn| Yeah, I'm awake, but my jams are all busted.
Jake| Right. Yeah, I saw that.
Finn| So, what happened? Did you save everybody?
Jake| Oh, yeah, I think so. Maybe.
Finn| So, Jake, there's nobody here. Did you notice that?
Jake| Yeah, pretty freaky.  Don't worry—ouch—  they're all hiding.
Finn| From what?
Jake| From me!
Finn| What?!
Jake| It's my birthday, man! Lady Rainicorn put together a elaborate surprise party.
Finn| She told you?
Jake| No, but I know Lady Rainicorn. Ouch!  This is totally something she would do. Think about it.
Finn| Oh, yeah, okay. So, wait, the whole kingdom is in on it?
Jake| Yes, and they'll only come out if they think we'll be surprised. So we got to act like we're totally unaware, okay?
Finn| Okay, man, and how do we do that?
Jake| Just do what I'm doing.  Oh, look at me, living free without a suspicion in the world. Never in my wildest dreams would I guess someone was plannin' a surprise birthday party for me!  Pretty tricky, right?  Come on, let's go back to the hut.
Finn| The what?
Jake| Come on, come on! 
Finn| Whoa. When did you find time to build this?
Jake| I don't know. It didn't take long. 
Finn| Hm. So, what should I do now?
Jake| Collect branches for the hobo fire, dude.
Finn| Okay. 
Jake|  Ouchies.
Finn| A hobo fi-ya, fi-ya, fi-ya.  Boy, it sure is quiet around here! Uh-huh! I'd probably pee all over myself if somebody jumped out and surprised me!  Oh, ugh! I stink! How long was I out for? A day or two?  Huh. What a convenient place to bathe.  Sure seems like a good time to come out if y'all are just hiding and you don't, you know, wanna see me  pop my top!  Ahh, yeah, that's fresh. I nobody's gonna jump out of the bushes and peeps my bod!   Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl! Hmmm.
Jake| Just gotta char off the rotten parts—good as new, man! Stay vigilant. Eat your protein.
Finn| Jake?
Jake| Hmm?
Finn| I'm starting to question your theory about the surprise party.
Jake|  Shhh!  Don't talk so loud! They might hear you!
Finn|  But what if they're in trouble?  What if something happened to them? We should try looking around.
Jake| Noooo!  You'll ruin my surprise party! Oww!   
Finn| Dude, are you okay?
Jake| Just promise me, Finn. Promise not to look around.
Finn|  Okay, I promise.
Jake|  ...my birthday's gonna be rad.
Finn| Hey, it's you!  Thanks for breaking my legs, ya dumb-butt!
Finn| That sounds like Candy People!
Finn| Jake. Jake!
Jake|  What?
Finn| I heard a sound coming from the sewer! We should check it out.
Jake| No, man, they'll surprise party me when they're ready. Be patient.
Finn|  I'm being patient! I waited all day, Jake!
Jake| Well, I've been waiting six months!
Finn| Wait, what are you saying?
Jake|   Everything's gonna be fine, even if we have to wait forever.
Finn| Have I been asleep for six months?!
Jake| Yeah, but don't worry about it, man.
Finn|  Face it, Finn, your best friend is gone. 
Jake| Hmm? Finn?
Finn|  
Jake| Noooo! Don't ruin the surprise!
Jake|  Rah! Ah! Ah!   Noooo! 
Finn| Oh, my Glob!
Jake|" Surprise!  ""Happy birthday, Jake!"" Ow! "
Finn|  Hey, Jake! What are you doin'?
Jake| This is how my party's gonna go down. Shake it, my friends.  Hey! Hey! Sure is great seeing y'all here. Really makes me think. Ow.   Lady, did you get extra TP for all the potty people?  No.  Well, we might have some party poopers here, and I want to be sure they don't wipe their buns on my cake.
Finn| Can I join your puppet party? We'll have twice the puppet voices!
Jake| You won't run away?
Finn| Naw, man, I'm with you. Happy birthday, Jake. Really.
Jake| Finn! Glad I can untie you, buddy.  Check it out! Finn finally made it to my party!
Finn| And I have a surprise for you! Close your eyes and don't open 'em until I tell you.  
Jake| Finn? You lied to me?
Finn| Yeee-ow! 
Jake|  What about my party? Don't go! Finn!
Finn| Whup! 
Finn| Hello?
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn...
Jake| Surprise! Surprise! Suprise!
Finn| You... you did this?
Jake| I did this? Ow.  They've been waiting for me, Finn, for my b-day!
Finn| Stop being crazy!
Jake| Oof. Yoo-a-hee! I'm a woman! I'm a woman!
Finn| Mah! 
Jake| Ring, ring!  Eh, hang on, deary.  Hello?  Baby, I told you never to call me here!
Jake| Wha... what happened?
Finn| A deer skronked your head and you lost your mind, man! You imprisoned the Candy People for your own sick birthday fantasy. Look. 
Jake| What? No. It's not even close to my b-day!  I'm so sorry.
Peppermint Butler|  You... you did not do this, Jake.
Finn & Jake| Wha—?!
Finn| Then who did?
Peppermint Butler| It... was... him. 
Finn & Jake|  
Jake| Freak deer! 
Finn| Grrrr! Jake, you free the Candy People. I'll take on the deer. Naw-hyah! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Thank you.
Jake|   Finn!
Finn| Huh?  Donk! 
Finn & Jake|  Nice!
Jake| We did it, dude!
Finn| How's your noggin?
Jake| Not crazy anymore! How's your legs?
Finn| Hmm, still broken. 
Princess Bubblegum| Thank you for saving my kingdom, boys. The deer wanted our sugar, but I didn't give him any, if you know what I mean. 
Finn|  Um... pyew! It's stanky in here!
Jake| Yeah, like bad breath and eggs.
Finn| Let's go home so we can get baths.
Candy Person| I wanna get clean!
Finn|  Walking, walking, walking – hambone break! 
Jake|  WooHoo! Hey!
Jake|  Get away from me. Quit it. 
Off screen|  Food for a beggar…
Man|  Food for a poor old man? 
Jake|  Whoa!
Finn|  Geez Louise, guy
Man|  So you got any, kid? Food? 
Finn|  I got this little piece of sugar.  Nuts, I'm freaking all about sugar. But I am even more about feeding hobos! 
Jake|  Whoa, man. Maybe helping this starving homeless guy is wrong thing to do.
Finn|  Why?
Jake|"  I don't know. I said ""Maybe"" "
Finn|  A hero always helps someone in need and besides he's probably a secret elf who will reward us for being nice. Here you go, buddy. 
Man|   You know, believe or not, I'm not really a beggar. I'm actually a…  Magic Man!
Finn and Jake|   Whoa!
Finn|  Aw, yeah!
Jake|  He's magic! I didn't expect this.
Magic Man|   Magic.... Away! 
Jake|   Think happy thoughts… Little, cute, bees, little babies, tiny, tiny bunnies.
Finn|  what is wrong with you, Magic Man?!
Magic Man|  You gave me that candy now I'll do you a favor in return. A magic favor.   A mystical, magical favor! 
Jake|   Whoa, dude!
Magic Man|  ...For you!
Finn|  why did you do that!?
Magic Man|  Because on this day, a magical life lesson comes to you.
Finn|  No! Change me back.
Magic Man|  Not until you appreciate what a jerk I am. Wazoo! 
Jake|  What a nutty guy
Finn|  What the heck, man?? What kind of deal is that? I help somebody out and they make me a stinky foot.
Jake|   You smell pretty good.
Finn|   Get off of me, man! I can't be a hero if I'm a big good-smelling foot!
Jake|  Maybe you're looking at this magic gift all wrong. Now that you're a huge foot you can kick evil's butt, like, way more times as hard. You're 100% kick, man!
Finn|  Why are you being so level-headed about this?
Jake|  Don't be a siss, Finn. Here, c'mon kick my butt. 
Finn|  You're the SISS, siss! Augh! 
Jake|   Ouch! oooh! Ouch. See, man. Let's give your foot body a shot.
Finn|   No, dude! I wanna go find that magic man and get my body back!
Jake|   Shhh shhh shhh shhh. Just be a foot for a little bit 
Jake as Finn|  Ok, I will.
Jake|  Awesome! Dude you will never regret this. Hahaha!
Jake|  Okay, when the next monster comes along, he'll step on that trigger over there, sending your giant foot body into the monster's crotch!
Finn|  This sucks, dude.
Jake|   Shhh!
Monster|   We're evil!  Our crotch! our evil crotch!!
Jake|   Hahaha! What'd I tell you? You're a great hero! Let's go set up some more crotch catapults so we can laugh and be heroes.
Finn|  No, Jake. Let's find that Magic Man.
Jake|  Finn, being an enormous crotch-kicking foot is a gift. Don't scorn a gift.
Jake|  Town on fire! This looks like a job for foot Finn stomping ability!
Finn|  But I-I can't even bend these big fat toes, man.
Jake|  You can do it, Finn. What'd I teach you, dude?
Finn|   Not to scorn the kicking of people in the crotch?
Jake|  You got it! Now I'm gonna go rescue all the babies in town  --only the babies.  Get your hero on, dude!
Finn|  Aaahh!
Finn|  Uhh. Okay, you can do this, Finn.  Start small, man. I'm taking you down! 
Finn|   It's hot! Oh, man, I'm smoking hot! Please, help me out! I can't move!
Townsperson|  It's another one of those freaks!
Townsperson|  He probably started this fire!
Finn|  No, I didn't start any –
Townsperson|  Throw him under the bridge with the others!
Townspeople|  Get rid of the freak.  Freak! Freak!
Finn|  Unh!  I'm not a freak, I'm a hero.
Jake|  Finn!
Finn|  Jake, how'd you find me?
Jake|  Oh, I can sense when you're about to cry. It's like a mother/daughter thing.
Finn|   I'm not going to cry, man! I just feel like crying. We have to find that magic guy and  get my body back now!
Jake|  What we have to do is find out what reeks under this bridge 
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|  Ew, it's blocking out your good foot smell.
Finn|  Get back here!
Jake|  Ugh, it—it smells like vomit on fire. It's like fancy cheese in an old guy's mouth.
Cyclops|  Welcome, travelers.
Jake|  Ahh!
Cyclops|  I am Gork, leader of Freak City. Ah, I can see one of you has felt the Magic Man's touch. 
Finn|  Yeah! You know that guy?
Gork|  I will tell you all that I know.
Gork|  We are the accursed ones, all once normal guys and gals who crossed paths with the Magic Man.  That's Zap, the Arm.  Trudy, the Waist.  That's Wee Wee and Gorflax.  They were turned into tonsils and that's Kim.  But, please, make yourselves at home. Would you like something to drink?
Jake|  Do you have any orange juice?
Gork|  No.  Well, uh, I don't know. Maybe. Uh, I don't think so. I'll go check.
Jake|  Yo, Finn, this place is really bumming me out. Let's get out of here.
Finn|  What?! No, dude. These guys might be my only hope of finding the Magic Man.
Gork|  Hey, we actually do have orange juice.
Finn|  Thanks for being cool and all, but what do you know about this Magic Man? How do we catch him?
Gork|  Oh, he can't be caught. He's got magic and we're worthless freaks. We can't ever beat him. So we've gather here to wallow in our self-pity.
Finn|  But don't y'all even want to try?
Kim|  Eh, no.
Finn|  Why not? You're all totally miserable here.
Zap|  Ugh. It's a living.
Finn|  No, it's not, Zap! It's not a living! It's dookie diapers! I don't want to be a foot!
Trudy|  Well, get used to it. We did.
Jake|  Yeah, Finn, maybe there's another lesson to be learned here--
Jake|  To accept what fate has given you  and stay a miserable foot. Gork, can we stay here in this pile of trash and rats forever?
Gork|  Yeah, man. Do it up.
Jake|   Awesome.  Here we go.
Finn|  Jake, stop screwing around.  You're gonna make me give into depression.
Jake|   Eh, what are you going to do about it? Probably nothing, right? If you're depressed, you'll do nothing. 
Finn|  I…  Maybe I will do nothing.] Maybe I'll just lay down here.  Lay down –uh —and rot like the rest of you.
Jake|   Yeah!  Stay a foot! Stay a foot! Stay a foot!
Finn|   ♫ Is this really my life?
Finn|  Get up, Gork!
Gork|  Huh? Why?
Finn|  ♪ I'm not gonna let you lie here,
Gork|  Whoa. Okay man, just be cool.
Finn|  ♫ And I'm not gonna be cool!
Jake|  Hey, Finn.
Finn|  ♫ Ja-a-a-ke, stop tellin' me to enjoy, bein' a foot, and get out of that trash! ♫
Jake|  Heh heh. I can't take you seriously when you're singing, man.
Finn|  Get up!
Jake|  Ahh!
Finn|  ♫All of you make me sick!
Gork|  Wait, Finn!
Gork|  Hey, stop it, man!  We don't like touching each other.
Finn|  Huh?
Gork|  Please, man.
Finn|  Wait a second. Kim, get underneath Trudy.
Kim|  No, man. Please. I freakin' hate Trudy.
Finn|   Kim, I will destroy you!
Kim|  Okay, Okay! 
Jake|  Yeah, do it, Kim.
Finn|  Yes! Now for me  Look at us!
Jake|  Whoa!
Gork|  We're like a big, normal guy.
Kim|  Thank you so much
Zap|  We are perfect together
Kim|  Oh, Finn, thank you.
Finn|  Word! Now let's go wreck up that Magic Man!
Jake|  Let me get in on this. I'll form the pants. 
Magic Man|  Food. Food for a beggar
Magic Man|  Y'all got any food?
Gork|  We've got a little orange juice left over from – Wait a second…
Magic Man|  That's right. It is I, the magic Man!  Zap
Magic Man|  Come on, apple grease! What are you gonna do?
Magic Man|  Ohh!
Zap|  We're not afraid.
Magic Man|  Are you sure about that?
Finn|  You're darn right we are!
Finn|  Give us our bodies back!
Magic Man|  Why should I? You still act like a hero only so you can get what you want.
Finn|  Oh. You were trying to teach us to be kind without expecting anything return. I should've given you that sugar cube without even thinking about a reward.
Magic Man|  Wrong! 
Finn|  Ah, geez!
Jake|   Finn!
Finn|   You've gifted us nothing but heartache, Magic Man! What is the life lesson in that?!
Magic Man|   Yes, my children, you are so close to the answer.
Finn|  Answer this!
Kim|  Get his eyes! Cut him in the eyes!
Finn|  I wish I'd never been nice to you 'cause you're just a big jerk!
Magic Man|  Oh, yes, that's it!  You've finally learned your lesson.  And now I'm off spread my teachings to more sissy do-gooders.  You're welcome!
Finn|  Man, I frickin' hate that guy. But at least now we can all go back to our regular lives.
Gork|  Well, actually, we like being like this
Zap|  Yeah, we're strong together
All|  Bye, Finn! Thank you!
Finn|  Oh, okay. Bye, guys. See you, later.  Wait, so, what was the lesson we just learned?
Jake|   Maybe it was, don't give your sugar to jerks.
Finn|  Speaking of jerks, what the blubbins, man?! Why wouldn't you help me turn back into a boy?!
Jake|  Well, because I kind of always wanted 
Finn|  What?
Jake|   I said, I kind of always wanted to be a foot myself.
Finn|  You could be a foot right now. I saw you change into a foot twice yesterday.
Jake|  It's complicated, man. You'll understand when you're older.
Princess Bubblegum|  The other one. 
Gatekeeper|  
Jake|   Finn? Finn?
Finn|  Sorry.
Jake|  Finn, I'm bored. Are you sure Princess Bubblegum doesn't like me anymore?
Finn|  Yeah. That's what she said.
Jake|  Sounds weird. Are you lying so you can do this dinner thing alone with Bubblegum?
Finn|  No way!
Jake|  I don't know if this is a good idea after your break-up with Flame Princess. PB is out of your age range, anyway.
Finn|  No way, man, I got no expectates. Whatever happens happens.
Princess Bubblegum|   Hey Finn! Let's go.
Finn|  Lates, bro.  Comin'!
Finn|  Hey-ey, things got fancy around here.
Princess Bubblegum|  Thanks again for coming to Castle Lemongrab with me, Finn. I kinda hate these diplomatic dinners. Also, I think the Lemongrabs are getting weirder.
Finn|  Oh, uh, you know me—pretty good with weird stuff.
Princess Bubblegum|  It's just a shame that Jake didn't wanna come. I love Jake.
Finn|  Yeah. We all love Jake. 
Orange Lemon Child|  Announcing arrival o' Princest Bubblegah and little boy!
Lemongrab|  Princess! 
Finn and Princess Bubblegum|  Holy—
Lemongrab|  Oh, so pleased and gracious to welcome you to our sophisticated society!  Bow.
Lemongrab 2|  Yes, welcome—
Lemongrab|   NO! Do it now!
Lemon Head|  It's... dinner time! 
Finn|  Yo, Peebs. How's your lemon?
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, this is mega-weird. Something's happened to the two Lemongrabs. They used to be exactly the same.
Lemongrab|   No, you're floating too high!  It's time for the floor show!
Finn|  Hey, princess! Look who happens to carry a flute with him. 
Lemongrab|  No! Lemons only! Floor show!
Lemongrab|  Do it better! 
Lemongrab|  WHAT?! UNACCEPTABLE!
Lemongrab 2|  Hmm. Acceptable.
Lemongrab|  What?! UNACCEPTABLE!
Lemongrab 2|   Acceptable.
Lemongrab|  UNACCEPTABLE!
Princess Bubblegum|  Ugh, I can't watch this any more. Excuse me, Finn. 
Finn|  Okay. Let me know if you get lonely!
Princess Bubblegum|  Man, this place is fallin' apart. Huh?
Lemonhope|   Oh, hi.
Princess Bubblegum|  What's your name, little boy?
Lemonhope|  My name is Badlemon Nohope, but you can call me Lemonhope.
Lemongrab|  That noise! That ugly lemon and his ugly noise! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey! By all accounts, this is a brilliant and sensitive little boy.
Lemonhope|  Thank you, mistress.
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm taking Lemonhope back to the Candy Kingdom and enrolling him in a school for gifted children.
Lemongrab|  No. He needs to stay here.  I hope you'll still be joining us for dessert.]
Princess Bubblegum|   We need to free that darling boy. Maybe there's something in the Candy Kingdom-Lemon Earldom treaty. I don't think there is.
Finn|  What about a prank?
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, what are you talking about?
Finn|  Mmm, I don't know. Maybe if we prank Lemongrab, like, just right, they'll let us take that guy home? Yeah. Prank.
Princess Bubblegum|  I don't see how that's going to help us at all.
Finn|  Pranks, like old times.
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, no, that's really—hmm... okay, yeah! We'll pull a prank. Like old times.
Finn|  Okay.  Puddin'  Bakin' soder.  Vinegar.  And the bait.  Now when Lemongrab stirs his pud  splode-cano.
Princess Bubblegum|   Pretty smart, dude.
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey!
Lemongrab|  Ah, my pud! I'm going to enjoy this pud. I'm really looking forward to this pud.  Oh, what is this?
Finn|  A-ha! Now give us back Lemonhope or prepare for mo' pranks!
Lemongrab|  Dungeon!
Finn|   Guess I must admit. One would have a hard time claiming that to have been a pretty good plan. Sorry, PB.
Princess Bubblegum|  No, no. Your plan was great, Finn.  See? What's this? Huh?  Your flute. Wow, now Lemonhope can play it and the Lemongrabs will come open the door to smash the flute and we can all escape! Really great work, Finn.
Finn|  Oh.
Princess Bubblegum|  Here, Lemonhope. Now will you play something for us? Something beautiful?
Lemonhope|  Yes, mistress. 
Princess Bubblegum|  Let me help you with—Lemonhope!
Lemonhope|   I was sharp at the harp, now it's my turn to learn the flute to boot! 
Lemongrab 2|  Come, one and all, and join the dance!
Lemongrab|   How dare you? How dare you release my prisoners? Soft Lemongrab! Softer than an old graham cracker! YOU'RE SOFT!! 
Finn|  Yike! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, no! We're locked in. Finn, give me your phone, I'm calling Jake!
Finn|  What? No! Let's, um... we could do another prank! I brought some of your super-spicy hot sauce! Ah, so spice!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, this is serious!
Finn|  But, my other plan worked.
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, your other plan failed, which was part of my plan, which worked.
Finn|  Your plan? But I thought we were having fun together.
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, I have citizens who need me. I can't always treat everything like a little boy game.
Finn|  Oh. Yeah, no, that's cool.
Lemonhope|  Mistress! Mistress, look! Something scary is happening now!
Lemongrab|   How dare you? How dare you? After all I've done for you?! You try to steal my Lemonhope away?! You're too old, princess. Too old for pranks. Too old!  I've tried imprisoning! I've tried reconditioning! You leave me no choice. Lemon Children!  Go forth! Go forth now!
Lemon Children|  Sorry, sir.
Finn|  Get to safety, princess! I'll hold 'em off.
Princess Bubblegum|  What?
Three-pronged Lemon Child|  Sorry, sir! 
Finn|  Wait, so do you not like any games, or just little boy games?
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn...
Lemongrab 2|  Lemon brothers! Stop! Stop and listen!  It has cost me much, but I have learned that lemon need not squeeze lemon to survive. Lemonhope, go forth, grow strong, and return for us!
Princess Bubblegum|  You're going to love the Candy Kingdom, Lemonhope. You're learn all about playing, and play-math, and learning all day long, and you'll never get yelled at. Unless you drink my soda from out of the fridge.
Lemonhope|  Yes, mistress.
Jake|  Yo, man, how's it going? Terrible?
Finn|  Well, yeah, mostly. But I think I learned something.
Jake|  Go on.
Finn|  Well, I'm thinkin' maybe age isn't just a number. Maybe older people, like, really are different. Y'know? Like, less fun inside.
Jake|  So whatcha saying here?
Finn|  I'm saying I think I really sponked up. I gotta patch things up with Flame Princess.
Jake|  Oh, dang! Didn't you hear? She's got a new boyfriend already!
Finn|  What?!
Jake|   Man, I'm just kidding.  She might, though.
Finn| You getting all bit up by mosquitoes?
Jake| I don't know... I'm getting bit up by something.
Finn| Man, I can't believe you said this was a good swimming hole.
Jake| I said it might be good. It's not, though.
Finn| True.
Jake| Wanna just go?
Finn| Yeah. This place smells like green beans.
Mudscamp| My name's Woobeewoo.
Jake|  Oh, whoa!
Woobeewoo|  I need your help. My people are in trouble. I'm a mudscamp.
Finn| Yeah, Woobeewoo! Of course we'll help. Why didn't you just say something before?
Woobeewoo| I'm shy. It took me a while to work up the nerve.
Finn| Oh. Right on. You good now?
Woobeewoo| We'll see.  Come, I'll take you to my village.
Woobeewoo| Here we are the village of my people. It doesn't have an official name, but I call it South Woobeewoo.  Uh, this way.
Woobeewoo|" This is the village elder. He'll fill you in on the ""deets."""
Woobeewoo Elder| Greetings, heroes. 
Jake|  Bleehhh! Aw! Ehhh!
Woobeewoo Elder| I'm so sorry about that. You know, we--we secrete stink oil all day out our awful-sauce glands. You know, I guess I should have warned you. Anyway, lemme cut the cheese.
Woobeewoo on right|  Cut to the chase.
Woobeewoo Elder|" Yes... I mean--I mean, of course ""cut to the chase,"" I mean, for many--for many moons now our village has been under siege by the Mega Frog. He's 100 stories of 110% 10-speed terror, like, bam, like, fresh out the grease. I mean, he chases us all up and down from first base to home, trying to eat us alive. We--we've always managed to escape, but it's c-razy scary, I mean, w-what if you got ate? Think about it.  All alone in a stomach full of acid.  ""Mommy! Mommy, Mommy, help me!""  ""Billy, is that you? Mommy you sound exactly--""  ""Mommy you sound exactly like m--""  ""Mommy, you sound exactly like me!""  ""Billy, uh--""  Anyway. If this keeps up, we'll have to move to the city and get jobs. We don't know how to--how to do anything cool. Look,  see, th-they're already practicing, the poor fools. They don't know what they're in for."
Jake| Whoa, relax, buddy! You're talkin' to the right couple of guys.
Finn| Yeah, man! Me and Jake will bust this Mega Frog up, right up his bumble-stop. 
Woobeewoo Elder| That is excellent news. I mean, h-here, take this, please.  It's not much, b-but it's all we have--  it's--it's a bag of lollies.
Jake| That's nice! Thanks, man.
Woobeewoo Elder| Now farewell, heroes! We're counting on you... for reals!
Jake|  Hmm.
Finn| Gettin' anything?
Jake| Yeah, but it's hard to make out. Could just be some footprints... or an old doodie.
Finn| Word... Hey, I have an idea. We can use those lollipops to leave a trail. That way we won't get lost out here.
Jake| Yeah, that's a great idea, man. I was just gonna throw 'em all on the ground anyway.  Whomp.  Whomp.  Whomp.  Whomp.  This way.  The thing with frogs is they got a real subtle smell. Kinda like when you open up a new thing of, um... CDRs.
Finn| Like... electric celery?
Jake| Yeah... but subtler.  Mm-HMM! Just as I suspected.
Finn| Sweet. These'll take us right to him.  Come on, Jake! 
Finn| Hmm. Huh. We've passed this butt tree, like, three times.
Jake| Oh, yeah.
Finn| We should probably backtrack--get reoriented and all that.
Jake| Word.  Wait, these prints are all messed up!
Finn| Whoa. Yeah! Guess we better follow the lollipops back. Where's those at?
Jake|  We ran out of those a while ago.
Finn| Snaaaap. Totally lost. Dang! Do you think maybe the Mega Frog made all those footprints on purpose? So we'd use up all our lollies and get totally lost?
Jake| What? Nah, man! Frogs are mighty dumb, you know that. He's probably runnin' around like that 'cause he's lost!  Plus, we're not even lost. I just gotta stretch up past these trees and see where we're at.  Dang. It's all misty! It's kinda nice up here, though.  AAAAAAAAH! Man, forget that! I can't see anything through that mist. Plus, I got struck by lightning. We're just gonna have to set up camp and wait out the storm.
Finn| Cool! I call fire patrol!
Jake| Yeah, me, too! 
Jake| Do you remember how to make a fire with sticks?
Finn| Yeah, man--it's easy.  Uhhh, rub 'em together, right?
Jake| Oh, yeah.
Jake| I don't think it's workin', man.
Finn| I think I saw some guy do it like this once. 
Jake| That's not it. I think you're on to something, though.
Finn| Yeah, here we go! 
Finn| Friction! 
Jake|  Come on, boys, come on!
Finn|  Mwah!  I don't know.
Jake|  You just gotta get some momentum going.  AAAAAAH! Glob-globbing stick! Glob-globbing swamp!  AAAAAAAAAAAAH!  Oh, hey, you got the fire goin'. Right on!
Finn| Jake, how did you--?  What the--? It's the Mega Frog! Quick, put the fire out!
Finn| Jake, look!  He's just sittin' there! What's he doin' out there?
Jake| I don't know, but let's pound him while he's vulnerable.
Finn| Okay, Sweetles.  What?
Jake|  Whoaa! 
Finn|  Hoi-YAAAH!
Finn| Wha--?  Jake, wake up. Look!
Jake| Ow, my head hurts.
Finn|  Look at that thing!
Jake| Oh, what?!  Yeah, . Hey, whoa! That gives me a great idea. We can make a Finn and Jake out of sticks and stuff and lure the Mega Frog out here, then ba-donk him right while he's all confused!
Finn| Yeaaaah! That's a great idea, man!  That's a great idea, Jake.
Jake|  Fuh-fuh-fuh... fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh... 
Finn| What? What is it, Jake?
Jake| FUH-FUH-FUH-FROOOOOOG!!
Finn| Wha--?  AAAAAAAAAAAAHH!  Jake!  RUN!  Jake, stretch us outta here!  Come on, Jake!
Finn| Jake, let's hide in this cave.  Shmow-tow, dude! That guy's gonna dingle our bones into tapioca pudding!
Jake| Finn, that is gross, man! Don't use language like that.
Jake|  Chomp that!
Jake| Aaaah! He's eating me! Aah! Gently eating me! No teeth! Mostly tongue!
Finn|  Hmm? Hmmm... 
Woobeewoo| I need your help. My people are in trouble... I'm shy... I mean, he chases us all up and down from first base to home. We've always managed to escape--.
Finn| You gettin' anything?
Jake| Yeah, but it's hard to make out.
Woobeewoo| I'm shy... first base...
Jake| Yeah, but it's hard to make out.
Woobeewoo| I'm shy.
Jake| ...it's hard to make out.
Finn| Hmmm. That's it!  Jake, wait!
Jake|  Oof! Sick, dude!  Huh?
Finn|  I know how to stop him!  Mwah! 
Prince Huge| Ah, this is rad! I'm hot again! Thanks, little dudes!  I really appreciate it!
Prince Huge| I don't get it, though... I kissed just about everything I could get my lips on. How come it only worked with you?
Finn| You can't break your own curse by kissin' somebody. Somebody's gotta kiss you.
Prince Huge| Oh. Weird. Well, thanks, man. I don't know a lot of dudes who'd do that to help a guy out.
Finn| Whatevs.
Princess Bubblegum| Mm-hmm. Six and 19...
Finn| One vampire—, two vampire—. Jake, check me out—I'm a self-sufficient mountain man. 
Jake| No!  Don't put that biz in your mouth, man! They could be booby-trapped or poisoned or—
Marceline| Whoa, chill, Jake. These pearls were dropped by The Moon. Her main power is accelerated healing. It'll be like fighting a cutting board.
Jake| Hmm. Okay. Anyways, we should try to find her before— No! 
Princess Bubblegum| See, Marcy? Isn't vampire hunting better with friends?
Marceline| Yeah, I guess. I'm just glad Simon is okay.
Jake| Anyway...  I don't care how easy this vamp's supposed to be. We should hole up somewhere before the sun goes down—It's down. Great.
Princess Bubblegum| Yup. Let's get going.  My vampire thingy is indicating high levels of vampire junk in...  this direction. Come on!
King of Ooo| Ha-ha!
Crunchy| Stop, please!
King of Ooo| Don't be such a nerd, Crunchy.  Hunting is the most royal of sports. The people expect it of their princess-king.
Crunchy| I don't think that's tr—  Ow!  Aah!
King of Ooo|  After him, Haydancy!
King of Ooo| Come on, Crunchy, it's dark. Let me tie you up.
King of Ooo| Aha! Good growling, Crunchy.
King of Ooo| All right, that's a bit much.
King of Ooo| Whoa, girl! Oof! Ugh!
Crunchy| Oh, no stop! Shush up! Huh? Oh!
Crunchy| It's it's okay. Animals can't climb trees. That's what separates us from them.
King of Ooo| Ha! Dumb, lowly animals.
King of Ooo| No! No, no, no, no, no!
Hierophant| Marceline Where is she?
King of Ooo| Oh, boy! I-I wish I knew! No love lost there, am I right?
Hierophant| Tell me everything.
King of Ooo| Okay, okay! I grew up poor dirt poor. The other kids called me Lil' Bubbles because we couldn't afford a bathtub. Sure, I try to act the way wealthy peeps are suppos
Hierophant| Shut up! Tell me where to find Marceline!
King of Ooo| Yeah, sure! Well, she hangs out with that Princess Bubblegum. You know her? Well, she has a nice little cabin by the, uh I'll draw you a map! Crunchy, do you have a pen? Tell me you have a pen.
Crunchy| Oh. Huh. Oh, this darn zipper Oh, brother.
Hierophant| May I come in?
Gumbald's Cabin| Aah! Ah ha ha! You're one of those old fashioned revenants, aren't you? You can't come in unless I invite you in! What do you think would even happen if you just walked in here, huh? You're so dumb, you sad old relic. How 'bout some garlic?
Hierophant| Hmm.
Gumbald's Cabin| You dumb vampire!
Hierophant| Ah.
Gumbald's Cabin| Wait! Don't go that way! Oh! Look! I'm out of the house! Come back! Come back! Back, back, back, back! He's not coming back.
Princess Bubblegum|   _/-]  Yo, guys? Pep says we got an incoming vamp.
Jake| What?!
Finn|" Is it ""The Moon""?"
Marceline| Doubt it. She's more of a hide-and-seek type.
Jake| So what's the plan for this chump? Given that he can see in the dark probably and could come from anywhere at any time and suck the flesh off our bones!
Finn| They could ambush us like right n Ahh!
Lumpy Space Princess| I feel refreshed! Are y'all hunting wabbits?
Finn| Man! I can't believe they just Left me here. All unarmed and tethered like this. Boy, my neck sure is hot. This baby needs to get some air.
Lumpy Space Princess| Let's do it.
The Hierophant| Back off!
Finn| What are you gonna turn into next, A puppy, a baby goose?! I'm a Pbht! Vampire! Pbht!
The Hierophant| Ah!
Marceline| Hierophant!
Finn| Pbht.
Jake| Green light.
The Hierophant| Ugh! Geez, aren't you cold up here? Don't people wear coats anymore? I've got a propo Oof!
Marceline| Oh! Surprise.
The Hierophant| Marceline, wait! Marceline!
Finn| Jake, gather up all the stakes you can find.
Jake| On it!
Lumpy Space Princess| Hey, Finn, catch!
Finn| Yes! Toots! Where'd he go?
Lumpy Space Princess| Finn, heads up! Finn, I'm helping! How about this? Use one of these stakes!
Finn| L.S.P., stop!
Jake| Finn, I got one!
Finn and Jake| Oof!
Lumpy Space Princess| What?!
Princess Bubblegum| Finn!
Hierophant| What is with all this tacky plastic rubbish?!
Finn| We'll never let you get to her!
Hierophant| Oh! You dunderheads! I can't even deal with all this modern nonsense! The rest of you, beat it!
Jake| My blood, man! I love my blood. 
Jake| Get in me!
Hierophant| Ohh! May I come in?
Jake| Nop.
Hierophant|" Grr! ""Grr""? Let me in!"
Jake| Not gonna happen, man! Eek!
Hierophant| What sort of creature are you?
Jake| Uh, I'm a magic dog with magic blood!
Finn| I've got gallons and gallons of warm red teenage blood, and you can't have it! Pbht! Eh, yeah? Yeah! Open up a murder-hole, buddy!
Hierophant| Oh! Marceline, listen to me. You will never defeat The Vampire King. You can't even defeat me in your current state.
Marceline| All right. What do you want?
Hierophant| The truth is, I hate the king as much as you do. He's a total dink. I came looking for you because I want to team up. Then you started tempting me with boy blood
Lumpy Space Princess| Hey.
Hierophant| and hurling spiky purple gobs at me. Here's the dope You need me.
Lumpy Space Princess| Yeah, okay, girl, you got this.
Hierophant| I don't know how it finally happened, but he must have let you beat him. Am I right?
Marceline| Ugh! All right, say we do work together. You need to give up drinking blood.
Hierophant| I'm a vampire! Drinking blood is kind of the main thing.
Marceline| And you can drink red just as easy.
Hierophant| Hmm.
Marceline| No hurting poor, scared, blood-filled animals.
Hierophant| Well, then, I suppose I have no choice. I'm just going to waste you And eat that kid, because that's what an old-school vampire does!
Crunchy| I don't want to play anymore!
Hierophant| No! I wasn't invited! No!
Finn| Geez. What happened?
Marceline| Dude was too old fashioned for his own good. He just couldn't get with the times.
Crunchy| Y'all see that? I killed a vampire.
King of Ooo| Aah, great! My plan worked!
Marceline|  Ugh. I don't feel so hot.
King of Ooo| Bye-bye!
Princess Bubblegum| Marceline! Oh, no.
Jake| Uh, guys, I'm not feeling that great eith Ugh!
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, Starchy. Now!
Starchy| I'm on it! Do I - Do I just pull this lever?  No!  I'm on it.
Princess Bubblegum| Excellent. These photos will help us find out what sort of forces Gumbald has amassed before we mobilize our troops.
Colonel Candy Corn| What's that, dear?
Princess Bubblegum| These photos will help us find out - 
Colonel Candy Corn| I'm glad there's going to be another proper war before I kick the bucket. Wipe 'em out!
Finn| Hey, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum| Finn, you donked up my recon!
Finn| I've got some important stuff to say.  I don't think going to war with your uncle is a good idea.
Princess Bubblegum| I don't have any choice. By building an army, he's forcing my hand.
Finn| It seems to me that all these rhubarbs down through history don't do nobody no good.
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, we all love how sweet you are, but sometimes we just have to buckle down and do things the ugly way. Excuse me. 
Colonel Candy Corn| It's gonna happen, son. Best thing to do is sharpen your sword and stock up on flower wreaths. 
Finn| You're dark, Colonel Candy Corn.
Jake| How'd it go?
Finn| No good. PB is on the road to war.
Finn| Jake, it's up to us to fix things with Uncle Gumbald.
Jake| Didn't he try to kill you with monsters made out of your own baby teeth?
Banana Guard 1| Take that banana face!
Banana Guard 2|  Uh, take this, you banana face.
Finn| Does everyone have to get caught up in this mentality? I'm going to march right over to Gumbaldia on a last-ditch diplomatic mission. Want to come?
Jake|  Do I?  This is cute, right?
Finn| You bet! And that's the number one priority for kick-butt diplomacy - the cuteness offensive!
Finn| Hey, this is kinda backwards, right?
Jake| How so?
Finn| I used to be all about violence. Now it's, like, I'm different.
Jake| You're a beautiful flower and I love to watch you grow.
Unknown voice| Halt!
Finn| Gumbald?
Green Knight| None shall pass.
Finn|  Fern.
Jake|  Cuteness offensive. 
Finn|  Okay.  I don't wanna fight! I'm just here to see your boss.
Finn| Fern, I know we have beef, but let's just talk. I didn't even know you were alive.
Green Knight|  You thought you had beaten me?  Me?!
Green Knight| Cool sword.
Finn| Fern, stop!
Green Knight| I used to want to be you. Now I'm a better you!  I've proved it. There's nothing you have that I don't.
Jake|  Bark! Bark, bark, bark, bark! Bark, bark, baraaaah!
Lolly| Boys! Boys!  Stop all this roughhousing!
Fern|  Yes, Aunt Lolly.
Finn|" ""Aunt Lolly"" - she sounds kind of like mom, yeah?"
Fern| Hey! She was my mom too!
Finn| I know, man. We're like family. So why are we fighting?
Lolly|  Sorry about him. Now what's a sweet boy like you doing here?
Finn| I'm trying to stop this ridiculous war. I mean, this whole thing is crazy, right?
Lolly| Between you and me, honey, I don't want war either.
Lolly| Gumbald is becoming so paranoid and erratic. All he talks about is baking that wretched, wretched cake. Maybe you can talk some sense into him.
Finn| Did you say he's baking a cake?
Chicle| Aah! A breach!  But my secret plan is to never die!
Gumbald| So, it begins. 
Finn| Wait! I'm a diplomacy boy today!
Lolly| Gumbald! He's just here to talk. 
Gumbald|  Traitor!
Lolly| I think we can trust him.
Finn|  Stop.
Gumbald|  I'll hear your case boy, but I've got a busy day. We'll have to walk and talk.
Finn| Look, PB doesn't want to attack you. You're gum from the same sidewalk. Like, just look at this bomb secret laboratory over here. This is exactly the kind of thing PB would have.
Gumbald|  Then why is she building up her arms?  You see this? This is her forcing my hand. 
Finn| But that's exactly what she's saying. You're both so unreasonable.
Gumbald| You want unreasonable? Get a load of my unreasonably bad boy battle automaton! Her name is The Cake.  My niece would never have the ambition for a project like this. But ambition is my whole deal! You want a closer look, boy? I grant it to you.
Gumbald| This magnificent dessert shall make the whole war relatively swift and painless.
Finn| So there's truly nothing I can say to change your mind?
Gumbald| Princess Bubblegum has made her bed, and now she must lie in it. But not get back up because she'll be dead. 
Finn| I was wrong about you. You're nothing like Bonnie.
Gumbald| Wait. She'll have her cake and eat it too - because she'll be dead! The Cake makes her dead!
Gumbald| What the -
Gumbald| No! No, no, no, no, no! Aah!
Finn| Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. The pain is astonishing.
Gumbald| You could have let me die and saved your princess a lot of trouble. Maybe there is a way to co-exist after all.
Finn|  Hey-o. That's what I like to hear. Sorry. I'm worried if I turn my neck my head might snap off.
Finn| So Jake is literally inside me, controlling my body and I'm standing in front of my girlfriend's entire family.
Gumbald|  No!
Finn| This is my first ever girlfriend. I really want her to like me.
Jake| So then I made him do a diaper baby dance! 
Chicle| You're as funny as me - the funny one!
Finn| Thanks, Chicle. But, if I could get serious for a second -
Gumbald| No need, Finn. Your example has said more than words ever could. Chicle, fetch the celebration bucket. I declare all hostilities between Gumbaldia and the Candy Kingdom ended. 
Finn| Yeah!
Jake| Whoo-hoo!
Chicle| Celebration bucket! 
Gumbald| Be sure to give Bonnie a big hug from me when you tell her.
Finn| You guys are goofballs.
Jake|  Blblblblbl!
Chicle|  Don't look at me! 
Lolly| Now there's a guy who - who really cares about his hair!
Finn and Jake|  Oh, cousin Chicle!
Jake| Man, I almost thought that was something really serious.
Princess Bubblegum| I don't believe it. A signed peace treaty? Finn, you're amazing. I could hug you right no- ...Did you stop at a craft store on the way here?
Finn| Oh, the glitter juice. It's part of a weird Gumbaldia treaty-signing ritual. Once I got to know him, your uncle was actually pretty cool. As I get older, I see the most important thing is to empathize with my friends and enemies. Like, co-exist instead of cutting off people's heads and stuff.
Princess Bubblegum| Peps?
Princess Bubblegum|  You've been doused with Gumbald's dumdum solution!  Gumbald!
Finn| Where are you going!?
Princess Bubblegum|  Candy citizens, we are going to war!
Colonel Candy Corn| Hoopty hoo, hoopty hey! Let's cut 'em up, folks. 
Finn| I donked up.
Green Knight| Don't halt. Continue running. I command it.
Gumbald| My thanks to you all for joining me here today. I hope you're enjoying the hors d'oeuvres.
Gumbald| It seems that the Princess avoided our attempt at a peaceful resolution. But it was still a good plan... Aunt Lolly.
Gumbald| This magnificent dessert shall make the whole war relatively swift and painless.
Lolly| Eh, I love to plan.
Crunchy| Hey. What's a plan?
Gumbald| Oh, cousin Chicle, you've still got it. Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to unleash plan B. My formidable legion of Candy Kingdom haters. Ricardio, Bandit Princess, Samantha the warrior dog, Peacemaster, Me-Mow, Pete Sassafrass, Ash the Warlock, Sir Slicer, Scorcher, the Green Knight, and finally, the Iced King.
Ice King| Uh, I think I might be here by mistake. What are we doing again?
Gumbald| It's Gum War!
Finn| Finn to Prubs, come in, Prubs.
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey, Finn! How's the mission going?
Finn| So far, no sign of the Bird Man. Why's this guy so dangerous?
Princess Bubblegum| Some say he's a half-man, half-bird that poops fire while he flies. It's all rumors so far. That's why I need you and Jake to find out everything you can about him and report back to me.
Finn| Where are you?
Princess Bubblegum| Under the sea. The mermaids are trying to beach themselves. I came to see why. Turns out they're just lonely. 
Finn| Maybe I'll go hang out with them after this biz.
Princess Bubblegum| Sounds great, Finn.
Finn| Okay. Bye, PB.
Princess Bubblegum| Bye!
Jake| C'mon, let's go look for that creep!
Finn| Whoa.
Finn|  Huh? Where am I?
Xergiok| This is the rookery, where I and my bird friends dwell!
Finn| So are you, like, the Great Bird Man?
Xergiok| That's what they call me nowadays. But when I first met you, Finn, and you, Jake, you knew me as  Xergiok, the Goblin King!
Finn and Jake| Whaaa—?!
Xergiok| When we first met, I was crazy for smacking goblin hams. I was cruel, selfish, brutal. But every thing changed after I was defeated by the two of you!
Jake| So, you got some sleek new shades, and now everything's different?
Xergiok| Oh, no, my change has been deep. And these whatsits are only curtains for empty windows.
Finn| Whoa. What happened there?
Xergiok|" I miffed off a wizard, and he took my eyes.  I wonder what he wanted them for—some kind of lotion... or potion... or time-traveling spell. I'll never know. Never, ever, never. But losing my eyesight was only the beginning of my wonderful change! I started meditating and doing yoga. Now I can ""see"" with my heart and smell with my soul."
Jake| You smell with your beard?
Xergiok| I smell with my nose!
Jake| Lame.
Xergiok| Om.
Finn| What are you doing?
Xergiok| Oh, Taffy! You heard my call!  Climb aboard, boys.  Taffy will take us to the lower level, and you can have a bite to eat!
Finn| Oh, uh, me and Jake will follow you. Jake needs to stretch out and stuff.
Xergiok| Okay, great! Well, follow me!
Finn| It's crazy, right?! The way dude's eyeballs are just hangin' there.
Jake| I know! I almost told him 'cause it was driving me nuts!
Finn| Yeah, me too!
Jake| Do you think he's got evil intentions behind his reborn star-child act?
Finn| I don't know. But if he does, I'm gonna find out.
Jake| Yeah, me too.
Xergiok| Nice and cool down here, isn't it? A-ha! Listen to the babies! Num-num time!
Jake| Aw, hey, that's cute.
Xergiok|  There you go, little ones. Suckle, suckle!
Xergiok| They're small, but they sure can take a lot out of you. Whoo! Dizzy. Sometimes feeding really wipes me out. I hope you'll excuse me while I refocus my qi.  See you in a while!
Finn| Now's our chance to do some snooping.
Finn| Jake!  I found his weapon stash!
Jake|  Hmm.
Finn| What is it? A fighting stick? A dagger?
Jake| This one's a letter from the hospital.
Finn| You can read those bumps with your fingers?
Jake| Yeah, I learned braille from my ex.
Finn| Your ex was blind?
Jake|" Nah, just cool.  ""Dear Xergiok, thank you so much for your donation. The kidneys fit great.""  Well, geez, maybe he has changed his ways!"
Finn| Maybe. Let's keep looking.
Finn|  Doy!
Finn| Oh!
Finn and Jake| Oh, crease!
Xergiok| Psychic links! Cardamom, my friend, I'm coming! I'm com—  Mother of Gob! Hold on, Cardy!  Okay, here I am, buddy. Ol' Xergy's here.  Let's see now—  Aw, dang! 
Finn| Wha—?
Jake| Shush, child!
Xergiok| Ah, Finn and Jake, you are here!
Finn| Where'd you learn that heal spell?
Xergiok| I use no magic. I manipulated space with a vibrational chant. You see, now the injury has transferred to me!  Ooh, yeah, that hurts, baby! Whoo! Can't you see, Jake? I love these birds more than I love myself. What am I to the deafening roar of the macro-cosmos? Nothing much. Just a vessel to carry the message of friendship to y'all beasts and dirt!
Finn| Dirt?
Xergiok| Yeah, look!  Hello, friends! Go for a ride!
Finn| Listen, man. About your eyes.
Xergiok| Yes, a wizard stole them.
Finn| Alright, but not— 
Jake| Finn! What are you doing, man?
Finn| Dude, he's changed!
Jake| Are you sure?
Finn| Uh, yeah, man. Isn't it kind of obvi?
Jake| Alright, tell him.
Xergiok| Tell me what?
Jake| Your eyes weren't stolen by a wizard. They're in your beard.
Xergiok| Alright. Oh, where are they? 
Finn| Dude, your eyes are in your beard.
Xergiok| A-ha, what? Good job, guys. Goofin' on the blind guy—real nice!
Finn| No, man, they're right here. 
Xergiok| What my life?!
Finn| We didn't tell you 'cause we thought you might still be a wong lord!
Xergiok| And these aren't grapes, right?
Finn| No, man.
Xergiok| Hmm. Finn and Jake, could you help me onto Cardamom's back? I would like to be high in the clouds, bathed in the pinks and the blues of the desert twilight, when I restore my sight.
Jake| Sure, okay. 
Xergiok| Climb aboard! Vanilla! Chocolat! Cinnamon! Agave! All my friends, to the sky!
Finn| How's it feel, man?
Xergiok| Oh, yeah, it's overwhelming. This view takes me back. I always loved the sunset. And the silhouettes of my little goblins lined up to receive their spankings!  Well, the past is the past. I wanna thank you guys for finding my eyes. I don't know where I got that idea about the wizard!
Jake| You were in the desert a long time, man.
Xergiok| Yes, twenty years.
Jake| Nah, it was more like one year and change, dude.
Xergiok| Yes, things certainly have changed for me in that time. Say, who's ruling the uh, Goblin Kingdom since I left?
Jake| Whisper Dan.
Xergiok| Oh, Whisper Dan! That's cool. Cool, cool. Hey, you guys wanna ride back to your crib?
Finn| Yeah, sure, man.
Jake| Uh, wait. Xergiok, this is the Goblin Kingdom.
Xergiok| I know, but I was thinking—now that I'm wiser, I could rule as king again!
Finn| That idea is terrible.
Xergiok| Well, you know, I disagree! And I have my army of bird friends, so anyone who disagrees with me should get a  SPANKING! 
Goblin Guard 1| Hey, Jeff, is that your real laugh? 
Goblin Guard 2| No, it's Xergiok.
Goblin Guard 1| Oh, Glob! 
Jake| Oh, dang! 
Xergiok|  Oh, yeah, baby!
Finn| Come on, man. Are you for real?
Xergiok| Attack, birds, attack! Where's the butt on this thing?  That sort of looks like a butt!  Yeah!  You like that? Huh?!  Whoa!
Xergiok| Wait! Cardamom! Nougat! Stevia! Dang!
Jake| You lost your friends, dude.
Xergiok| Yeah, I feel myself hitting bottom again. Yup, okay, here we go. 
Xergiok| Here, Finn. Take my eyes and bury them forever. I will not need them again.
Finn| Okay, man. 
Xergiok|  Thanks.
Jake| Are you gonna be alright, man?
Xergiok| It's cool.
Finn and Jake| Bye!
Finn| Dude, that sucks. I hope he finds peace, or something.
Goblin Guard 2| He's going to the reservoir! 
Goblin Guard 1| Um, why is he doin' that?
Goblin Guard 2| Maybe he's thirsty.  Oops, I guess he was just sad.
Finn| Should we save him?
Jake| Nah, man, he's fine.
Finn| What the—?
Xergiok| I found a girlfriend!  I'm in love! Woo!
Finn and Jake| Calling all curlys!
Finn|  Careful! You'll wreck my gift for Princess Bubblegum.
Jake|  Whoops. Hey, what's it supposed to be, anyway?
Finn|  It's... a scale model of the Candy Kingdom, made out of my saliva! 
Jake|  ...Sooo this means you wanna give 'er your spit, huh?
Finn|  Yup!  HEY, NO—
Jake|  It's okay, dude. I totally get it. Haw haw haw.
Finn|  I just wanted to give 'er somethin', uh... to celebrate her science... thing.
Jake|  You mean her... Super Science Barbecue?!
Finn|  You think it's science-y enough for 'er?
Jake|  Relax. She'll love it!  And then she'll love you. Heh heh heh...
Finn|  Wha?!
Jake|  Hey, there's Bubblegum!  Hide it behind your back, man!  Princess!
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh. Hi, guys! Just gettin' the grill cookin' for tonight's BBQ!
Finn|  Oh!
Princess Bubblegum|  What's that you got behind your back there, Finny?
Finn|  Oh, I... I made you somethin'.
Princess Bubblegum|  Really? Can I scope it?
Finn|  Yes. Close your eyes.
Princess Bubblegum|   A'ight.
Finn|   Get ready to open your eyes!
Princess Bubblegum|  Achoo!  Can I open my eyes?
Finn|   No, wait, uh, keep 'em closed for, like, three more hours!! 
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm gonna open my eyes.  Oh, Finn! It's pink! I love pink! Oh, thanks, Finn!
Chet|   Princess! Princess!
Peppermint Butler|   Better not say nothing, you!
Princess Bubblegum|  Yes, Chet?
Chet|  Um... So, I called grill-meister for the BBQ, but Pepper won't give up the spatula!
Peppermint Butler|  Fine, fine. You can have it...  ...when you pry it from my cold, dead hands!!
Chet|   NOOOO!!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey... If you two aren't watching the grill, then who's watching the....  ...GRILL?!?!
Finn|  MEAT!! WAH!!  DIE, YOU FIRE!!! 
Princess Bubblegum|   Finn! That was awesome.
Finn|  Oh. Heh... Thanks, Princess. I'm always happy to help.
Princess Bubblegum|  I see. Your heroic brain is fascinating in a scientific way. Many scientific minds are going to be speaking at my barbeque. You should talk about something, too. You'll do that for me, right?
Finn|   Anything you want...
Princess Bubblegum|  Thanks, Finn!  Listen, I have to deal with this.  See you tonight?
Finn|   Uh... Yeah! 
Jake|   Buddy, just breathe into me.
Finn|  Ah?
Jake|   You're just gonna give a speech to a buncha' brainiacs.
Finn|  I can't hang with those guys. I'm full of stupid.
Jake|  Then we'll just borrow some brains by goin' to the place where knowledge liiives!
Finn|  Oh, Brain Town!
Jake|  Uh, no, the library.
Finn|   The Library of the Undead...
Jake|  No... Just the regular library.
Jake|  Hey, Finn, let's split. This turned out to be boring.
Finn|  But I have to cram this info!
Jake|  Okay, okay... I'll just keep readin' this book about figs.
Finn|  And I'll just read this book about pigs.
Jake|  Haha! Whatcha doin'?!
Finn|  I'm bored now, too!
Turtle Princess|   Shh! Hey! That's completely inappropriate! 
Finn|  But... w-w-we were just enthusiastic about learning!
Finn|  Hmm... So, if I can't book-learn for beans, we'll just get some smarty to explain scientific junk to me!
Jake|  Yeah, then you can at least sound smart... but where're you gonna find someone like that?
Finn|  Jake... we're goin' to college.
Professor worm|"  And the great question endures... ""Who would win in a battle between Nietzsche's Übermensch... and Mandroid?"" The answer is...  WEREWOLF QUEEN! IT'S ALWAYS WEREWOLF QUEEN!"
Finn|   Rad!
Jake|  Heh heh heh heh heh.
Finn|  Jake. You can just shrink yourself down.
Jake|  Oh, yeah.
Professor Worm|  And when I finally meet the Werewolf Queen, she will take me on as her royal consort and we will rule in blood!
Finn|  Hey, teach. Can you talk more about scientific... uh... stuff and things?
Professor worm|  Well... sure, I could...  if this wasn't a class on THEORETICAL FIGHTONOMICS!
Finn|   Ohhh...
Professor worm|  Are you even in this class, Mister....
Finn|  Uh... Wormy... uh, Wormy McSquirmy!
Professor worm|   McSquirmy, huh? Well, we'll just see about that, I—  Oh! There you are. W. McSquirmy. I'm sorry. Yes, you're registered and you haven't shown up for a single class!
Worm|  Truancy hurts us all, McSquirmy!
Finn|  Hey! Ow! Please! Where's your compassion?!
Professor worm|  Let's kill 'im!!
Worms|  ASSAIL!!
Worm with glasses|  Excelsior! 
Finn|  Jake, let's get outta here!  OW! 
Professor worm|   And stay out of Academia! 
Finn|   Well... that's it. I'm all outta ideas on how to learn this junk.
Jake|  OH! Let's just solve this thing with magic!
Finn|  No... That's the easy way out.
Jake|   Yeah. It's the easy way out!
Finn|   Oh! Oh, yeah! Let's go visit Choose Goose and his magical shack!
Choose Goose|  Magic, you say?! 
Finn|  Yeah, Choose Goose! I need magic! Some kind of mind-enhancing magic.
Choose Goose|  Ah, yes, the quest you are on, requires  the Glasses of Nerdicon!
Finn|  So... I just put those on, and then I'd be able to give that lecture... and Princess Bubblegum will totally dig it. Yeah! Whadaya want for it, CG?
Choose Goose|  Lately, I've been feeling drained. I only wish to be entertained.
Finn|   Hmm... Oh! 
Choose Goose|  Well done! The glasses, you have won! 
Finn|   Everything small is just a small version of something big!! I understand everything!!
Jake|  Whoa, bud, are you okay?
Finn|  Oh, Jake... I'm better than okay. I know exactly how to impress the princess.
Jake|  More spit bubbles?
Finn|  No. No. Those spit bubbles were as fragile as my old perception of reality. But wait! Maybe you're on to something! I could show the princess bubbles the likes of which no one has ever seen!!
Jake|  And how will you do that?
Finn|  I'll start with a solid bulleted list!
Princess Bubblegum|   Thanks again to Dr. Dextrose for sharing your fascinating research on the future of cuteness.
Finn|  Yes, yes, how charming. What... quaint notions.
Princess Bubblegum|  And now for a special guest lecture by one of Ooo's greatest heroes... Finn the Human!
Finn|  Ladies and gentlemen... and princess...  I'm here to talk about multi-dimensional bubbles! But I'm not just going to talk about blowing bubbles! I'm going to blow... your... minds!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hmm?
Finn|   This is a bubble-blower of my own design. With this, you can blow bubbles in different dimensions.  This two-dimensional bubble casts a one-dimensional shadow.  A three-dimensional bubble casts a two-dimensional shadow.  A fourth-dimensional bubble casts a three-dimensional shadow... IT IS BEYOND COMPREHENSION!  Beyond space!! Beyond time!!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn... that would mean you've created...
Finn|  Yes... A BLACK HOLE!!!
Princess Bubblegum|  FINN!! DO SOMETHING!!
Finn|  It's okay. I'm sure the solution is on my bulleted—  LIST!!  Don't worry. I have everything under control.
Princess Bubblegum|  UNDER CONTROL?! MY GUESTS ARE TERRIFIED!!
Princess Bubblegum|  YOU'RE TRYING TO KILL US ALL?!?
Finn|  NO, OF COURSE NOT! I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU THE GREATEST CONFERENCE EVER!!!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn...! You've gone insane!
Finn|  What?! No way! I'm, like, the smartest guy in Ooo, thanks to these glasses!
Princess Bubblegum|  Glasses? Finn... take those off. You're not yourself!
Finn|  But—
Princess Bubblegum|   Please!! I need the real you!
Finn|  What's goin' on?!  WHOA!!!
Princess Bubblegum|  You blew it, Finn! With this! 
Finn|  Then I'll kill it... with this! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Be careful!  Finn!! Look out!!
Finn|  Wha? Fourth-dimensional! Jake! Let me go!
Jake|  Finn!! Don't do anything stupid!!
Finn|  I can't help it, man!!  I'm all about stupid!! YAAAAAAH!!! 
Jake and Princess Bubblegum|  FINN!!!!
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn... My Science Barbecue was a fiasco... 
Princess Bubblegum|"  What's this?  ""Make hyper bubble. Cause black hole. Become insane. PB takes off the glasses. Save the day. Win the heart of the princess.""? Finn, you knew all this would happen?!"
Finn|  Huh? Knew what? I wrote that list when I was insane with smartness!
Ice King| Una— unacceptable. Mm... un-unacceptable. Unaccepta—aah!  Lemons! Whew! Mm.
Ice King| Gunter? Y-you having a bad dream? Gunter?
Ice King| Oh, my Glob. 
Empress| Hello, Simon.
Ice King|  Oh, lady! Hi.
Empress| Wait, you don't remember me?
Ice King| Oh, man. I'm so sorry. I stalk a lot of ladies. Were you at Shelby's barbecue?
Empress| Huh. Looks like you've lost it all the way. You've crossed the valley of tears and come out the other side but a shadow.
Ice King| Oh, thanks.
Empress| Well, all the better for you to...  submit.
Ice King| I like where this is going.
Empress| Don't resist.
Empress| Sell your spirit to the skies. Surrender to The Empress eyes.
Ice King| Empress, my darling! My great eternal love! How can I serve you?
Empress|  Bring me blood.
Ice King| At once! 
Ice King| Alley-oop! 
Penguin|  Wenk-wenk!
Empress|  Oh, this is so sad.
Ice King| Here you go, my love.
Empress| What's this? Don't you have any human?
Ice King| Humans? Well, Finn's the only human around here. Try a penguin. 
Penguin| Wenk!
Empress| Ugh. 
Ice King| You know, Empress is a kind of penguin, and your name is Empress. That's kind of cool, right?
Empress|  Bleh. Tastes like cheese water. Where's the top-drawer stuff?
Ice King| Oh, uh, don't be like that, Honey-poo. I'll fix it. I'll do anything for you.
Empress| Bring me the blood of Finn!
Ice King| Okay.
Empress|" Oh, look. I've gotten to my bit. ""Today I met a super-pretty cyclops lady with fangs. She told me to eat a fat boulder, and I did it."" Ha! I'd forgotten that one."
Marceline| The Empress!
Jake| Vampiyah, I'm gonna kick yah Vampiyah, I'm gonna lick yah Vampiyah Aah! Uh-oh. It's P.B.'s outside clock!
Finn| Ahh. You did a tremendous job guarding the cabin, Jake. But it looks like you need to be relieved.
Jake| Yeah, I need relief. P.B. still working on new vampire-busting gear?
Finn| Yeah, but she's almost done. No sign of Marceline, though. I think she ditched us to fight the vampires by herself. Solo-style. We'll go look for her after P.B.'s device is up and running. So, how did you pass the time?
Jake| Patted my laps and made some rhymes. Stoop, stoop, sittin' on the stoop Stoop, stoop, sittin' on the stoop
Finn| Is that P.B.'s outside clock? Looks like it's been staked. What did you do?
Jake| I heard a loud snap, and my vampire-hunting reflexes kicked in!
Finn| Dude, that was her Uncle Gumbald's outside clock.
Jake| Yeeegh! She doesn't have to know I broke the clock. Let's blame it on the vampires! Or we can hide it! Whoo! Problem solved? Yeah? Whooop!
Ice King| Snap!
Finn| Aaah! What was that?! Vampiyah! Aah! Aah! Hyah! Hah!
Ice King| Snap, snap, snapping branches for fun
Empress|" Oh, ho, ho, this is riveting. ""The Empress is so nice. Today she let me polish her boots with my tongue. That's almost like kissing, right?"""
Ice King| Hey! Who's my hunny bunny?!
Marceline| Simon!
Empress| Marceline!
Marceline| What has she done to you? Did she bite you?!
Ice King| Hey, calm down. You're destroying the mood. I'm trying to get her to bite me later.
Empress| Minion! Honestly, I'm standing right here as you collude against me with my sworn enemy. It's a bit rude.
Ice King| Sorry.
Finn| Eh! Stake! Yeah!
Marceline| Finn?
Finn| I got your back, Marceline! Ha! Huh?
Empress| Ow. How dare you stake my back?
Finn| I was aiming for your heart!
Empress| Ice King, bind the interlopers in ice.
Ice King| Heh.
Ice King| Let's keep it down, huh? My baby's resting.
Finn| Aaaaaah! No way! Waaaaaaah!
Ice King| Shush!
Marceline| Simon, you have to resist the Empress!
Ice King| But she's a woman. Aha! Ohh.
Marceline| She's a vampire! I hunt vampires because of you!
Ice King| Because of me?
Marceline|  Staking vampires, protecting the last remaining humans, it felt like I was protecting you. It was the only thing that brought me happiness during those years.
Ice King| Oh, Marceline! 
Marceline| Simon? A-are you remembering?
Ice King| Pa-chazz!
Finn| Shmowzow.
Marceline| Please, Simon! Remember our history!
Ice King| Our what now?
Empress| Oh, Marceline. I heard everything. I was invisible. All your tiresome mortal emotions, they'll all be over soon.  Minion, I order you to kill Marceline.
Ice King| Whaaa?? No way! She's my pal!
Empress| Are you disobeying me?
Ice King| Hey, it's called real talking.
Empress| and you still can't get anything right, can you?
Finn| Here's our chance!
Ice King| Please, baby, don't say that.
Empress| You're my thrall.
Ice King| I am enthralled by you!
Marceline| You distract the Empress.
Marceline| Squeeze!
Ice King| Yaaaah!
Empress| Ha!
Marceline| No!
Ice King| Heuk!
Empress| Drat. Aaaaaaaah!
Marceline| You got this comin'.
Ice King| No!
Marceline| Simon, what are you doing?
Ice King| Let me go! If you want to hurt my lady, you'll have to go through me!
Marceline| Uuuuuugh!
Empress| Now, Oaf! Kill her!
Ice King| Sweetie, there's no need to raise your voice.
Empress| What?! Okay, that's it. Turn and look at me.
Ice King| Oh! Are we gonna gaze into each other's eyes again?
Empress| You must fall deeper under my spell. Sell your spirit to the skies.
Ice King| I can see myself in your pupils. Hee-hee.
Empress| You're not even hypnotized. At all.
Ice King| Them gigantic sparkly orbs of yours could hypnotize an earclops.
Empress| So, you're not.
Ice King| Eh-heh, no.
Empress| You're stupid donkey
Ice King| B-but honey, wh-why you being so mean to me?
Empress| Because you're too thick to even fall under my spell. And you got no class.
Ice King| Oh, so you're doing that? You're gonna start name-calling? You want to play the blame game?! Okay! Well, if you weren't so perfect and and pretty and statuesque and and
Finn| Come on, Simon. It's over.  It's gonna be okay, man. Nope, nope. This way. This way. Come on, let's get you some ice cream.
Marceline| That's the last time you're gonna toy with his heart.
Empress| Psht! If you really cared about him, why'd you let him degenerate into this pathetic clown character? He used to have more of a silver-fox thing going on, with his hair and those cute glasses. He was happier then, you know. When he was serving me.
Marceline| Aaaaaaah!
Empress| Dang, girl.
Marceline| Aaah! Aaah! Aah! Gah!
Empress| Open those peepers!
Marceline| Eat a stake! Huhn No!
Empress| Ugh! I don't understand this.
Princess Bubblegum| Marceline! Yeah, you're welcome! Hunh Um Marceline?
Marceline| All right. I shouldn't have tried to go it alone with the vamps. From now on, we'll do this team-up style.
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, team. You're still invisible.
Marceline| Oh! Heh whoops.
Jake| Oh!
Marceline| Hm.
Voice| Whoo, show me them legs!
Jake| Shelby?
Shelby|  Hey, Dancing Bug! Uh, come on, man. Shake it.
Pincer Beetle|  No. I really couldn't—Okay! Maybe I could! 
Scorpion| Whoa, dang, DB. You're the best bug at this party!
Shelby| What? Hey, I got moves, too, guys.
Scorpion| Yeah, right, Shelby. What are you gonna do? The Worm?
Shelby|  No. I'm gonna do parkour.
Scorpion| Hmm.
Shelby| Haha!  Parkour!  Ah, oh no. I really hurt myself.  Guys, I'm so dumb! 
Shelby|  Ugh. Hey, somebody forgot their—oh, cram!  Um...who are you?
Kent| Pbht!
Shelby|" Oh. There's-There's a note. ""Hey, dude, the tip of your tail got snipped off, so now you have a little brother. We named him Butty Butterson. Signed, the other bugs.""  I'll call you Kent for short."
Shelby| Jake..Jake!
Jake|  Hmm? Whoa, Shelby! What's going on there? With your butt?
Shelby| It's fine. I was goofing off, got hurt. Now I got a little brother. I named him Kent.
Kent| I'm Kent!
Shelby| Whoa! A talking brother.
Jake| You can chop up a worm and get two? I thought that was a myth.
Shelby| Myth is a powerful force in my life, dude. So the thing is, I don't know beans about being a big brother. Can you give me some tips?
Jake| Ah, it's easy. You just give him something sharp and get him to fight bad guys.
Shelby| That's it?
Jake| Yeah, you might have to stretch all big if he gets in real trouble. But, yeah.
Shelby| Alright. Sounds good.
Kent| Someday, you'll be Kent's food. 
Kent|  Oh wow. 
Shelby| Hey, how'd you do that?
Kent| I don't know.
Shelby| Hmm. Okay, Kent. This is real important. You're my little brother, so your purpose is to fight bad guys. So go fight some bad guys. Or girls. Don't discriminate.
Kent| Oh. Okay, brother.  Boo-oop. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop!
Kent| Hyah!  A bad guy. Ah! Let's fight!  Aaah! Hey, get back here! Don't run! I'm super new at fights. And at being alive. 
Dewdrop| Hi.
Kent| Who are you?  Where am I? Why do my parts hurt?
Leaf Beard| Oh, good, you're awake. I am Leaf Beard. I found you blonked out and bruised in the tunnels. But if you drink of our dewdrops, it will fix up all your ouchies.
Kent|  Pbht!
Leaf Beard| The rat king has made his way to our end of the roots. You should be more careful.
Kent| Oh. Oh, okay. What's a rat king?
Leaf Beard| Oh. You're not from the roots.
Kent| I'm from my brother's butt. Maybe.
Leaf Beard| The rat king's been destroying our home, chewing up the roots of this tree. This tree that gives us life!
Guy| Hey!
Kent| So, he's a bad guy?
Leaf Beard| So sick, nasty bad.
Kent| That means I got to fight him. That's what my brother said to do! Where's my sword?
Leaf Beard| Your sword was shattered to butts when I found you.
Kent| Oh...bummer.
Leaf Beard| Yes. Bums.
Kent| What do I do?
Leaf Beard| Um...I don't know. But the blacksmith could make you a new one, probably.
Dewdrop| That's who I am. And I am very good at me. Okay, so, like, the rat king has been messing up the roots, yeah? Chewing on them with his teeth. The sword has to be made with the strongest tree stuff so even his teeth can't break it! Bring me the freshest ingredients and I'll do it up.
Kent|  Boo! Cool, cool.
Mouse Wizard| Greetings.
Kent| Hey, man. I'm looking for some unbreakable ore. Y'all got that here?
Mouse Wizard| I have what you seek. But consider this instead.  I offer you this treasure of glittering emeralds. You'll be infinitely rich and live the rest of your days in comfort.
Kent| No, I'm good. Just the ore, please.
Mouse Wizard| Oh, ho! Well done! By resisting the temptation of wealth, you have passed my test.
Kent| Nah, I just don't care about money. My name's Kent. I'm supposed to fight bad guys.
Mouse Wizard| Alright. That's pretty weird, but...here you go.  The unbreakable ore. Uh... Uh..you can just—yeah.  Oh, there, there she goes.
Kent| Ha, ha!  Boop, boop, ba-doop, ba-doop, ba-doop, boop, boop, boop.  Whoop, whoop!
Mouse Knight| Greetings. Come to fight me, eh?
Kent| My name is Kent, and if I had a sword I'd totally fight you. But for now, I'm looking for a clod of mystic earth.
Mouse Knight| Yes. I have what you seek. But consider this instead.  I offer you the hand of one of my beautiful daughters. You'll become a good husband and live the rest of your days in true love.
Kent| Nah, I don't care about being a good husband or wife or whatever. All's I care about is fighting bad guys.
Mouse Knight| Dang, homes. That's cold.  Here you go. Mystic earth.
Mouse Thief|  Greetings.
Kent| Dude, you know why I'm here!
Mouse Thief| Yeah. And I got what you want. But consider this instead. Hiya!  Drink this sap, and you'll have life eternal. You'll never meet death and you'll outlast the world.
Kent| Um...I was born earlier today, so I don't really get a sense of my own mortality. No, thank you.
Mouse Thief| Hyah!  The sacred flame.
Dewdrop| Oh, what? 
Kent|  I name this sword..Punch Party!  I feel so cool right now.  It's party time.  Whoa! Uh!
Rat King| Greetings.
Kent|  Who's there?
Rat King| I am the rat king.  Why are you here?
Kent| I-I've got, like, this rad sword, and...I'm gonna fight you with it.  Yes!
Rat King|  Who are you fighting me for? Your brother?
Kent| What?
Rat King| Instead, why don't you join me? I offer you cosmic power. You'll be a king and live the rest of your days as a god.
Kent| You're messing up the tree, and I totally live here! You're a bad guy!
Rat King|  Yeah. 
Kent|  Don't do that! 
Rat King| How do you plan to defeat me?
Kent|  I'm...making...this...up...as I go! 
Shelby| Having a brother around looks kind of fun.  Where are you? Little Brother? Are you happy?  Or do you feel weird? Have you changed a lot? Or not? Are you ever gonna come back here? I shouldn't have been so hasty. You were just a little baby. Or maybe you weren't. I'm not really sure how little brothers work. 
Kent| You were the first friend I ever had.
Both| No one can compare. Together we could probably fight a bear.  So if you're ever sad/lonely, don't be, 'cause I'll be  right here next to you. 'Cause that's what big brothers are supposed to do. 
Shelby| Whoa!  Kent proceeded his fantastic journey to me. It was all super good. But he had also partaken of the food of the underworld, and so he was compelled to return there by dewdrop law. That's what he said, at least. Maybe he was having second thoughts about infinite riches, true love, and eternal life. Or maybe he had just decided that fighting bad guys wasn't really his deal.  But I do know this—free from the rat king's cursed teeth, that spring, for the first time in many years, the willow tree was in bloom. 
Jake|  You want some more eggs, BMO?
BMO|  Yes, please.
Jake|   How 'bout you, Finny? Need a refill?
Finn|  I'm pretty full, man... but lemme see if I can... rearrange.  Nope. Can't do it.
Jake|  I don't know if stomachs work like that, dude.
Finn|  Sometimes it helps.
Jake|  Can't argue with that!  Ahh...
Finn|   Ahh...
BMO|   Ahh...
Jake|   Hello? Lady, it's gonna be fine. Mm-hmm. Alright, I love you, too. Bye. 
Finn|  Lady Rainicorn again?
Jake|  Yeah, man. She's worried about introducing me to her parents at lunch today. She thinks they're gonna freak out.
Finn|  Um... maybe give her parents some treasure?
Jake|  No way! That's our treasure! Wait. I've got it, dude! I'll invite them over early, smooth them over using my personality, and we'll all be best friends before Lady gets here so she doesn't have to feel nervous! It's perfect! I'll just send them a quick Prism-gram.  Mm-hmm. 
Finn|  What's it say?
Jake|  Hold on. It's still converting the light waves into brain waves.  Ahh... They're into it, dude!
Finn|  Sweet! Let's go powder our noses!
Finn|  Why's Lady so nervous, anyway?
Jake|  Well... she didn't really say, but it might have somethin' to do with the Rainicorn-Dog Wars.
Finn|  There were wars between rainicorns and dogs?
Jake|  Horrifying wars. For thousands of years, rainicorns battled dogs over territory in the Crystal Dimension... but Lady and I are cool.
Finn|  Dude! Her parents are probably all full of dog-hatred from the war-times! They're gonna see you're a dog and forbid Lady from ever hanging out with you again!
Jake|  ...Nah. That could never happen.
Finn|  You didn't think this through enough... IT COULD HAPPEN!!
Jake|  AAAH! I'M A MORON!
Finn|  Don't worry. I've got a plan that's gonna solve this biz. Homies help homies. Always.
Jake|  I'm ready to hear your plan, homie.
Finn|  Haha, yeah! This plan is perfect!
Jake|  You know, I thought painting ourselves rainbow-color using condiments and stuff from the fridge so we could pretend to be rainicorns was a good idea when you pitched it to me five minutes ago, but now I'm not so sure, man.
Finn|  Come ooonnn. Trust me, homie.
Jake|   No, no, no, new plan. First, we're gonna clean this place up, and then—  Huh?!
Ethel|  Jake?
Jake|  AAAAH...  LET'S HIDE AND BURN THE HOUSE DOWN!
Bob|   Hello? 
Jake|  안녕하세요. 
Ethel|  Jake, is that you?
Jake|  Uh-huh.
Ethel|  Are you going to let us in?
Jake|  Y-yeeeaaah... 
Ethel|  AAAAAAHHHH!!!
Jake|  I can explain!! I can explain!!
Ethel|  OOOHHHHH, he's so handsome! Oh, Bob, our daughter's finally found a handsome rainicorn to love!
Jake|  You think I'm a rainicorn?
Bob|  I think we can spot a member of our own species, Jake. We're not blind.
Ethel|  Well, we are a little blind.
Bob|  Yes, I guess we are a little blind.
Jake|  Uh, well, hey! Come on in! It's awesome to finally meet you both!
Ethel|  Your house is very colorful. I like that!
Finn|   Haha! The plan is working, homie!
Bob|  Jake, what is that thing that's talking?
Jake|  Uh... that's um...
Finn|  I'm Jake's rainicorn roommate! Everyone do the traditional rainicorn rain dance! 
Bob|  Jake, please ask your goblin butler to stop insulting my heritage!
Jake|  Uh... y-yes!  Get outta here, goblin! Go fetch us some rainicorn snacks!
Finn|  But—
Jake|   Come on, homie, help me!
Finn|    Ha! You got it, homie!
Jake|  Uh... please, c-come upstairs.
Jake|  My goblin will bring us snacks in a moment.
Bob|  Thank you, Jake. I'm glad the wife and I made the trip from the Crystal Dimension.
Ethel|  Yes, we're eager to know more about the studly young rainicorn that's dating our daughter.
Bob|  Ethel...
Jake|  Well, ask me whatever you like, Ethel, Bob!
Ethel|  I am a little curious about your goblin. He looks a little odd.
Jake|  Well... he's actually a human.
Ethel|  Oh, Bob! Our future-son-in-law must be filthy-rich to afford a human butler!
Bob|  Shh.  Thank you, Jake, for being interested in our daughter!
Jake|  Uh... No problem, Bob!
Ethel|  Oh! Let's play some traditional rainicorn games!
Bob|  Jake, do you know Cameladabalawabapp? 
Jake|  Uh, s-say it again?
Bob|  Cameladabalawabapp!
Jake|"  Ohhhh!  Cablatapuamba—! I thought you said ""Kabloderaga—""!  Ah, man, I love gettin' down and dirty with some Cablatapuamba—! Ha! Y'all should go first, though."
Bob|  Hmm. Bold move letting your opponent move first, Jake. I respect that. Very well. Cameladabalawabapp!! 
Ethel|  Oh, Bob!
Bob|  Haha! Your turn, Jake!
Jake|  I...
Finn|   Snacks! Get your snacks!
Jake|   Finn!  Dude! I have to show Lady's parents that I have rainbow powers! I need homie help!
Finn|  Hmm... I got a plan, bro-ham. Just stretch your horn at me, and I'll take care of the rest.
Jake|  You're the best, homie.
Finn|  Homies help homies.
Jake|  Haha!  Cablatapuamba—!
Ethel|  Very unusual color palette, Jake.
Bob|  Yes. Subtle.
Jake|  Whoo! Oh, yeah!  Finn?
Bob|  How about we play some more traditional rainicorn games, my boy?
Jake|  I, uh... Oh. Um... let's do it!
Bob and Ethel|  Let the games begin!
Jake|   I'm sorry.
Jake|   Yo, my bad! I'll get 'im!  Hey, man. How's it goin'?
Finn|"   IT'S ""GOING"" CRUD-COW!"
Jake|  I know, I know, I'm sorry. But they really like me. Your plan is working perfectly!
Finn|  Being poked in the buns and laughed at was not in my plan! Not in the plan!
Jake|  Look, Finn, you know I got yo back fo'-eva', but right now, you're the only one who can help me. Come on, homie.  Homies help homies.   Hey, guys. You ready to get this game goin' again?
Ethel|  Oh, no, we're pooped.
Bob|  Yeah, we're about ready to break out our picnic basket and dig in!
Jake|  Wohhh, no. You're my guests. Let me take care of you.  Homie... help me cook something, please.
Finn|  ...Okay.
Jake|  Thanks, Finn.  Okay. Don't worry about a thing. Finn'll make a great lunch. He's a little raw, but he's got great taste.
Bob|  What?! Wow! So wealthy, and so generous!
Ethel|  Ah! I was hoping!  I was afraid to ask!
Finn|  WAAAH! Jake!! I think they wanna eat me!!
Ethel|"  Of course we do! Jake said you'd ""make a great lunch""!"
Finn|  JAKE! COME ON!
Jake|   Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, man....
Finn|  AAAH! Knock it off, Bob!! 
Ethel|   Don't you touch him!!
Jake|  Come on, stop it, guys! Come on, y'all, I said stop!  NOW, THAT'S ENOUGH!!! Nobody's eating Finn!! He's not my butler, and he's not food! Finn is my friend!  I'm sorry I let the lies get so far outta hand. I just got so scared of losing Lady!  But if they hate me, so be it. No more lies. 
Ethel|   You're a dog?
Jake|  Yeah, I just...  Look, I'm sorry about everything. I was—
Bob|  YAAAAAY! HA-HEEEY! HURRAAAAY!
Jake|  Uh... uh...  Lady?!
Lady Rainicorn|  어, 나도 우리 부모님 때문에 걱정했었어! 우리 엄마아빠는 개라면 완전 맛이 가거든! 개가 전쟁터에서 우리 아빠 생명을 구해줬었어! 
Finn|  What did she say?
Jake|  She said she worried that they'd freak out... 'cause her parents are bananas for dogs!
Finn|  J.J. FLIP! What the zip?!
Jake|  Yeah! She says a dog saved her dad in the war!
Finn|  Wow! That's flippin' awesome.
Ethel|  Finn.
Finn|   ...Wha?
Ethel|  Listen, I just want you to know how sorry we are about... trying to eat you.
Bob|  It's just we thought we'd never get another chance. We thought humans were extinct.
Finn|  Oh.
Jake|  So... this isn't human?
Ethel|  Oh, no. This is soy people!
Finn|  Oh.
Ethel|  I've never tasted real human before, but they say you can't even tell the difference!
Jake|  Ew... Soy?  FINN, YOU'RE DELICIOUS!
Jake|  Finn, lunch is ready!
Finn|  Ugh, what are you cooking?
Jake| It's good! I learned it from Rainicorn.
Finn| I'm not eatin' that. It smells funny.
Jake| Dude, this took me, like—
Finn| Let's go over to Tree Trunks's and get some apple pie! Apple pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Apple Pie! Let's go! 
Jake| Whoa!  Eh.
Finn|  Tree Trunks!  
Finn|  Tree Trunks! Tree Trunks?
Tree Trunks|  Apples... my apples...
Jake| Apples?
Tree Trunks| You!  You took my apples! 
Finn| Whoa, whoa!  Tree Trunks, it's us, Finn and Jake!
Tree Trunks| Finn... and, and Jake?
Finn| It's okay, Tree Trunks. We're here to help you. Just tell us what happened.
Tree Trunks|  They took 'em. They took all of 'em.
Jake| All of what?
Tree Trunks| Apples. My apples that I raised with love from, from mere seedlings. Without my special apples, I won't be able to bake any more apple pies.
Finn & Jake| NOOOOOOOO!
Finn| Don't you worry, Tree Trunks. We'll find those thieves and bring them to justice.
Tree Trunks| Let me show you the crime scene.  You see, boys scads of apple trees but, but no apples.
Finn| Hmm. Is anything else missing, Tree Trunks?
Tree Trunks| No, Finn, they didn't touch my rocks, or my birds, or my flowers, or, or nothing.
Finn| Hm. Well, I don't see any footprints. What'cha got, Jake?
Jake|  No ghost doodies. Oh. Oh, wait.  Oh, no. No.
Finn| Hm. Tree Trunks, is there anyone you can think of who might want to crunk you up?
Tree Trunks| Oh, no, Finn. I take great care to assure that-that I'm loved by even the most heinous cretins—
Jake| Hey, guys, I found something! Look!
Tree Trunks| Uh!
Raggedy Princess| Oh, heheh, hey, Finn. Heheh.
Finn| Oh, hey, Raggedy Princess. Have you seen anything fishy going on?
Raggedy Princess| Um, no, heheh. I've been kinda down in this hole for a long time.  I got knocked down here by some ne'er-do-wells. It was terrible. I was so scared.
Tree Trunks| Ne'er-do-wells? They stole my apples.  I'm gonna sass those boys up nasty!
Finn|  Awesome. Where do we find these guys?
Jake| Oh, the Candy Tavern, man. I used to hang out there back when I used to snatch old ladies' purses.
Jake| Don't worry, I stopped doing that a long time ago. I didn't know it was wrong.
Tree Trunks| Okay, you two, let's get going.
Candy Tavern Person| Whoa!
Tree Trunks|  Oh, my!
Finn| Uh, does Princess Bubblegum know about this place?
Jake| Be cool, man. You're gonna queer the deal.
Finn| Oh, yeah. Try not to act suspicious, Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks| Okay, I won't.
Finn & Tree Trunks| Where—?
Finn| Oh. 
Tree Trunks| Where's my dang apples?
Finn| Oh,  Tree Trunks, you're so silly. But, but listen, you wouldn't happen to have seen any—I don't know—apples around, have you?
Bartender|" ""Seen any apples?"" Y'all ask a lot of dumb-butt questions... almost like you're trying to solve somethin'."
Finn| What? Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no.
Bartender| Mmm... clean, too. Almost like some  do-gooders!
Jake| Hold on, we gotta go potty.
Finn| Dang. They almost got us, but I think we blend in pretty well now.
Tree Trunks|  This, this toilet paper's drying my mouth all up.
Finn| Uh, Tree Trunks, don't eat that.  Here.   You gotta watch her, man!
Tree Trunks| Oh, I look just like an army brat!
Bartender| What can I do for you?
Finn|  You know where a guy might maybe score some apples? 
Bartender| Well, when you put it like that.... A couple of buddies I know have some apples for sale. I'll show you.
Bartender| Hey, fellas, these folks been askin' 'bout your... apples?
Jaybird|  Okay, show 'em the apples, Smudge.
Jaybird| Grab 'em!
Jaybird| You go back, and you tell your boss to stop looking for those apples 'cause they're ours now!
Finn| Wha-what boss?
Jaybird| Your boss! Dr. J?
Finn| We don't know any Dr. J.
Jaybird|  Liars! Come on, Smudge   ...gonna take my apples.
Jake| What just happened?
Finn| I guess these guys who stole Tree Trunks' apples also stole Dr. J's apples, and they thought we were workin' for him!
Tree Trunks| Finn? Finn.
Finn| Hm?
Tree Trunks| This could be dangerous, a-and if you want to go back home, I understand, but I need to do this.
Finn| Yeah, Tree Trunks, me too.
Jake| Hey, Finn.
Finn| Hm?
Jake|  What's that on your face, buddy?
Finn| Oh, that guy bopped me one. Must've had a ring on.
Jake| Y'know, I think I seen that symbol somewhere before. Yeah, right next door to where I used to hawk stolen bikes.
Finn| What?!
Jake| I didn't know it was wrong.
Jake|  Yeah, you see? That guy must work here or somethin'.
Finn|  Hello?
Wormo|  Who's the heck happening? What?
Finn| Uh, we're here about the apples?
Wormo| Oh, okay. Let's see your ring.
Finn| Um...
Jake| Here. 
Wormo|  Come on in. Follow this guy. 
Wormo|  My boss is gonna be real psyched I found someone to buy his apples. A whole crate. 
Finn| What the?
Wormo| What's wrong, guy?
Finn| These aren't apples.
Wormo|" Oh, ya didn't mean diamonds? All ne'er-do-wells call diamonds ""apples."" Like calling money ""bread"" or rock-knockers ""butter-slaps."""
Jaybird|  Hey, Wormo, we're back—what the?!  What are they doing here?
Wormo| They're here for the apples.
Jaybird| That's the dang Dr. J gang, Wormo! Grab 'em!
Tree Trunks| Um, sir?  I promise if you let us go, we won't tell no one about your apples.
Wormo| Feed 'em to the pig.
Smudge| Yeah, the pig.
Jaybird| Heheh, yeah, all right. 
Mr. Pig| Uh, I'm sorry, y'all. They're makin' me do this. I-I'll try to make it quick.
Dr. J| Hold it!
Jaybird| Dr. J! 
Dr. J| Yeah, yeah, and I want my apples back.
Jaybird & Dr. J|   Get 'em, boys!
Finn| Aw, don't cry, Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks| But we're never gonna find those apples.
Mr. Pig| Apples? You guys looking for apples?
Jake| Uh, yeah, why?
Mr. Pig| 'Cause I can hear a bunch of apples in this room.
Jake|" Wait, you mean ""apples"" as ""diamonds""?"
Mr. Pig| No.
Jake|" ""Apples"" as ""apples""?"
Mr. Pig| Yep.
Finn| You mean apples that we eat?
Mr. Pig| Yes.
Tree Trunks| With all due respect, Mr. Pig, sir, my apples were stolen by a dirty, rotten criminal who needs to be put in jail.
Mr. Pig| I'm just telling you the facts, ma'am. What I hear is a whole pigload of apples inside that closet.  They sound scared.
Tree Trunks| Well, I hate to tell you this, boys, but there's no apples in this closet.  You see, uh, I'm the only one who knows how to open this closet. 
Tree Trunks| Oh, so I was the apple thief after all.
Finn| No, Tree Trunks, that's preposterous.
Tree Trunks| No, Finn, I'm a criminal,  and I need to pay the price.
Banana Guard| Banana Guard speaking.
Tree Trunks| Uh, this is Tree Trunks. I've done somethin' horrible, and I want you to come over and arrest me.
Finn| Tree Trunks, you don't need to do this.
Tree Trunks| Thank you, Finn and Jake, but I won't let myself slip away from such a terrible crime. Goodbye.
Finn| Tree Trunks.
Banana Guard| Ah, this is hard to watch. I'm gonna look away.
Banana Guard| This place could use a scarecrow.
Finn| Huh? Wait, what'd you say?
Banana Guard| Uh, I-I said this place could use a scarecrow.
Finn| A scarecrow, no footprints, all those magpies on the roof, Raggedy Princess in the ditch, and all the apples in Tree Trunks's closet.
Banana Guard| Boy, this place could use a scarecrow.
Finn| That's it!  I knew it!
Finn| The magpies have been stealing the apples and accidentally dropping them in this hole!
Jake| And that's why there weren't any footprints around the tree!
Finn| Yes. And the magpies were able to steal the apples because Raggedy Princess wasn't sitting on the fence post to scare them off!
Tree Trunks| Does this mean I'm innocent?
Jake| As innocent as a baby's butt cheek!
Finn|   Awesome! This calls for a celebration! You know what that means, Tree Trunks!
Tree Trunks| I'ma bake you the biggest and the tastiest apple pie you boys ever tasted. 
Banana Guards| Whoa.
Tree Trunks|  Uh, you boys better stick around if you want a bite of my apple pie. 
Banana Guard| She slapped my butt!
Finn| What's wrong with you, man?
Jake| I ate all the candy in your backpack, and now I'm sick.
Finn| I didn't bring any candy.
Jake| Oh, no. That explains why it didn't taste right.
Finn| Nothing tastes right today. Like, I thought we were going to get into some serious flavor with these sand people, but they're just standing around like garnish.
Jake| That's how I feel—like a dying parsley. So what's goin' on with the spoon? Marceline and the spoon.
Finn| Um...  nothing.  Wait, there she goes!
Marceline|  Yo, wake up, sand dude.  I think they're dead.  A spoon.
Finn|  Yea-uh. The Spoon of Prosperity!
Jake| It doesn't look like mu—
Jake| Oh, my gosh, I feel so much better! Hungry, even. Guys, let's go home!
Finn| We've gotta get this spoon to Princess Bubblegum first.
Jake|  ♪Let's rock!♪
Marceline| What's PB want with that spoon, anyway?
Finn| Beats me.
Jake| Sometimes it's better not to know.
Marceline| Yeah, I guess that's true with Bonnibel.
Jake| Hey, guys, look what I found! 
Marceline| Is that quicksand?
Jake| Yeah!   Heh. Quicksand is pretty fun. Heh.
Finn| Quit messing around, Jake.
Jake| Okie-doke.
Finn| Whoa!
Jake| Hmm. Hey, is this whole place made out of sand?
Marceline| Sure looks that way.
Jake| Uh, give me a pull, please.   Stop, you guys are tickling me! Let me try this other thing.  Flesh drill!
Finn| I'm not sure that's a good idea—
Jake|  Yaah! Rug burn! Ow! Ow!
Jake| Aah!  Whoo! It worked! Jake drill worked, you guys.
Finn| Whoa!
Jake| Check it out! My piggies are free. 
Marceline| You just demolished half the underground city!
Jake| Yeah, only half.
Finn| You also sealed our exit.
Jake| Our only exit.
Marceline|  
Jake| No regre-e-e-ets!  I'm sorry.  This little piggie stayed home, and so should have I. I know! I'll dig us out of here.
Finn & Marceline| No!
Finn| You'll bury us alive!
Marceline| Undead!
Finn|  Finn to PB. Come in, PB.
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, hi, Finn.
Finn| Princess, we're trapped in the underground city.
Princess Bubblegum| Yeah-yeah. That sounds great.
Finn| Huh? No, we need help!
Princess Bubblegum| That's great!  Gre-gre-great! Great, great!
Finn|  Guess we lost the signal. 
Marceline| Any more bright ideas?
Jake| Snacks!
Marceline| How are snacks gonna get us out of here?
Jake| I wanna eat snacks... because I am hungry.
Marceline| I'm hungry, too. Bust the snacks, Finn.
Jake| Bust, bust, bust!
Marceline| Hey, where are my red erasers? They were in here.
Jake| Uh-oh. I thought they were candy.
Marceline| You... ate all... MY RED?!?!
Jake| Oooh. I'm sorry!
Finn| Calm down, Marceline. There's gotta be some red stuff in these ruins. I'll go explore. You guys hang out here and save your energy.
Marceline| Thanks, Finn.
Finn|  Be cool.
Jake|  So how hungry are you?
Jake| Aah!  I'm sorry. Please don't eat my blood!
Marceline|  Jake, I don't want to hurt you, but you should know things get crazy when I'm hungry.
Jake| Like... how crazy?
Marceline| I'm gonna go into feral mode.  It's not gonna be pretty.
Jake|  
Marceline| I know. Let's tie me up. That way, you won't be scared.
Jake| And that will keep you from draining my bloods?
Marceline| Not physically, no, but as a prop, I think it'll be good for both of us. You know, psychologically.
Jake|   Hurry, Finn.
Finn| Red, red, red. I guess even a vampire queen's face would melt off if she tried to eat lava.
Marceline| Get me a bucket of lava, Jake.
Jake|  Yo, you know better than that.
Marceline| Do iiiit...
Jake| Don't go crazy, okay?
Marceline| I'm frickin' hungry.
Jake|  Why did you leave me here, dude? 
Finn| Okay, here we go. Yeah, look at that!  Something crazy red behind this door. Hmm.  Why are y'all holding this door shut? You don't look like sand peeps, neither. More like wisemen-zerts . Oh, well. Gotta feed the Marcy monster.  'Scuse me. Up, sorry. Okay. Uhh... hi-yah!  Oh, dag.
Finn| Cool... What the heck happened here?  Whoop!  Ew. Whoops. Y'alls got turned into sand people. Don't go in the light. Go like this.  Around it. Next time, you guys. Hmm...  Whatever's down there's gotta have red blasting out of every hole. Hey, you're not still alive, right?
Finn| Okay. I was just making sure.  Bet that guy was a creep.  This hole is deep.
Jake| Oh, my Glob. Oh, my Glob, where are you, man? Marcy's wiggin' out!
Marceline| Jaaaake...
Jake| What?
Marceline| I can smell your insides, Jake.  They smell...  red!
Marceline| Yeah, lemme see in there.
Marceline| Oh, yeah.
Finn| Maybe I should go back. Well, I've already gone this far.  Shebang! That oughtta be enough red to un...  Oops.
Crab Demon| Paris? Is that you?
Finn| You mean the guy with the big thing on his head?
Crab Demon| Yes. Have you returned to complete the plan?
Finn| Naw. Paris is, like, super dead.
Crab Demon| What?! No! How long?
Finn| Dude, like, a really long time. Like five hundred years.
Crab Demon|  Five hundred— Chum! I must've zoned out!
Finn| What the heck were you two doing?
Crab Demon| Once we turned the city to sand, we were gonna reanimate their bodies and conquer my homeland at the center of the planet.
Finn| Hm, that's dumb.
Crab Demon| Time to go back home a true loser.
Finn| Can I have this big ol' ruby, then?
Crab Demon| That's an emerald.
Finn| Clearly it's a big ol' ruby.
Crab Demon| I don't know what to tell you, man.
Finn| I would like the ruby.
Crab Demon| It's yours, buddy.  I'm outties. ]
Finn| Peace. Hyup!    Whoops.
Jake| Okay,  all done now. Nice and snug, right?
Marceline| Jake...
Jake|  What?
Marceline| I won't be able to... to control myself much longer. I can feel the feeding frenzy coming on.  I just wanna let you know I'm sorry. 
Jake| You're sick!
Marceline| Yeah... 
Jake| C'mon, Jake, think...  It's no good! I need brain food.  Oh, dang, I ate everything!  I'm so hungry! Baby's gonna starve to death! Unless... 
Marceline| What?
Jake|  
Finn|   
Jake|  
Marceline| What are you doing?
Jake| I'm cooking up a crazy vampire! That should heat up nice! The sand will keep the meat moist.
Marceline| You're gonna eat me?
Jake| You was gonna eat me!
Marceline| Yes, I am. 
Jake|  Cook, baby, cook!
Jake| Finn!
Finn|  Bleh. The trick is rollin' it. Phew! Check out this ruby I got.
Jake| That's an emerald, dude.
Finn| You too now?! Emeralds are green, boyee.
Jake| This thing is green.
Finn| Why is everybody messin' with me? It's like a dark gray-ish red. Mostly gray. Sometimes red things are gray!
Jake| You're a little colorblind... and there's nothin' to be ashamed of!
Finn| Oh... whoops.
Jake| I'm sorry you had to push that thing so far.
Finn| Uh, what's goin' on with Marcy?
Jake| She was threatening to eat my insides, so I'm cooking her. I know that sounds crazy, but I had no choice.
Jake| I'm operating on my lowest survival brain function right now. What?  
Finn| Chill, man!
Jake| No, we gotta book!  Go!
Marceline|  Go where, Jake?  I gotta suck out your insides first, right?
Finn| Nay-nay, brah!
Marceline| Time to eat!  Huh? What the—?
Finn| Bubblegum?
Princess Bubblegum| Hey, guys. I saw my seismograph had gone off the charts, so I figured you might be in trouble, right?
Jake| Yeah, but watch out for Marceline. She's gone rabid!
Princess Bubblegum| What? Marceline's gonna rap for me?
Marceline|  Woof. Thanks, Bonnie. That's enough low-grade red to get me home, at least. Come on, guys. Let's go.
Finn| Are you alright, PB?
Princess Bubblegum|  Did you get the Spoon of Prosperity?
Finn|  Yeah, here you go. 
Finn, Jake, & Marceline| Whoa.
Princess Bubblegum| Peeps will never starve in my eternal empire. Sand worm, up!
Marceline| Come on, Marce. It'll only hurt for a second.
Marceline| That's nothing in the face of eternity.
Marceline|  A second hurts really bad in the face of eternity.  But only for a moment.
Marceline| Wait. I have an even better idea.  Sunscreen. SPF 10... million.  Hmm! I have exactly enough to reach my umbrella.
Peppermint Butler|  Ha!  
Bubblegum| You really like chopping wood, huh?
Peppermint Butler| I'm not chopping wood. I made a toothpick from the ancient elm. See?
Marceline| Uh, knock, knock.
Bubblegum| What the dip, Marceline?
Marceline| Sorry. It was supposed to be a joke. Actually, I have something really serious to ask. I want you to do the procedure, the one we talked about.
Bubblegum| I'm sorry, but I don't think you'd make a good blonde.
Marceline| No, not that. I don't want to be a vampire anymore.
Bubblegum|  Oh, my globness.
Marceline| You said you were working on a cure, right?
Bubblegum|  Well, the machine is built and the serums are ready, but are you sure you want to do this?
Marceline| I'm sure. Some bad things happened to me when I was little. When I became a vampire, I was just a messed-up kid. Now it's 1,000 years later, and I'm still messed up.  I don't want to spend eternity like this, with this emptiness. I want to grow up.
Bubblegum| Okay. Let's do this.
Bubblegum| This means someday you'll die. You know that, right?
Marceline|  I guess that will be my last adventure.
Bubblegum| Marceline I'm so very, very, very excited to test my new lab out on you.
Marceline| Well, don't get all sentimental on me.
Bubblegum| Come on over here. You know I care about you. I think you're making the right choice. Your natural life spend is going to be richier and fuller than you can imagine. And someday, when you die, I'll be the one who puts you in the ground. But, you know, this operation might not even work.
Marceline| Whooooooooa! This tickles really bad!  Did it work?
Bubblegum| Well, I sucked all your vampire effluvium into this bucked. Possibly we won't know the results for a couple of days. In the meantime, you need to get plenty of rest. I'll check your vitals in the morning.
Marceline| Thanks, P. Brains. 
Marceline| No!   Huh?
Cloud Dance| It's breakfast time for my sweet babies.  Sweet babies! Operator! Put me through to Finn and Jake. It's an emergency.
Jake| Victim's lost a lot of blood. Clean entry wounds. It's an expert job.
Cloud Dance| Poor miss baby. She used to be my best cream cow. But now her milk is nonfat. And nanette, my beautiful calf is decaf!
Jake| That's terrible!
Villager| Every farm in our village was attacked. Not a goat or a cow or a duck left un-sucked.
Jake| Well, I've heard enough. Come on, Finn. Let's go arrest Marceline.
Finn| Wait a minute. We don't even know if Marceline did this.
Jake| That's right. I forgot about Ooo's extensive vampire community.  Come on!
Finn| Yeah, but we need to conduct a proper investigation.
Jake| I know that. Ain't no rookie.
Finn| All right, come on. I'll let you be bad cop.
Jake|" I'm already bad cop. Okay, let's not pay seeds. Me and my partner will ""interrogate"" the suspect police-style. Meanwhile, you sharpen up your pitchforks mob-style."
Villagers| Yeah!
Finn| Hey, man, that's not right. Marceline's our friend.
Jake| Physical contact! Officer resisting arrest! Boom!
Finn| Ow!
Marceline| Ohh, woof. Marceline want to go ny-ny.
Bubblegum| Don't go ny-ny, Marci. I'm worried.
Marceline| For real? Why?
Bubblegum| Well, the process was experimental. Like, are there side effects? What happened in your sleep last night? Nobody on record has ever cured vampirism, unless you count killing vampires as curing. In that case, you've cured tons, right?
Marceline|" ""Tons"" is an understatement."
Bubblegum| That Shnoz was nasty, nasty times.  Hey, cover up. The sun's hitting the door.
Marceline| I'm still undead?
Bubblegum| We don't know yet. So just chill. Oh, hey, guys. How you doing?
Finn| Jake did excessive force on me.
Jake| I'm sorry.  Let me kiss it! 
Finn|  Ew! Ew!
Bubblegum| Hurry up. Get in here.
Jake| You done it this time, Marceline. You sucked the life out of defenseless animals!
Marceline| I ain't done nothing.
Jake| You think I'm buying that boom-boom mountain?
Marceline| Oh, get some proof.
Jake| You want proof? Look. 
Finn| Whoa!
Jake| Proof of how off I'm gonna go if you don't confess.
Finn| Yo, chill, Jake.
Jake| I'm wilin' out!
Finn| Listen, Marci, I can barely control this guy, and the villagers are getting crazy. They want to run you over with a wagon, and I'm offering you a way out.
Peppermint Butler| Hey, dillweeds, I just swept the place.
Jake| Sorry.
Marceline| Finn, be real for a second.
Finn| All right.
Marceline| Look into my eyes, man. I didn't do it.
Finn| To be honest, it looks like you're not sure if you did it.
Marceline| Okay, I'm not sure! Something weird happened last night. I had a weird dream about stuff.
Jake| Dream stuff always means something.
Finn| We'll figure this out, Marci, together. We promise.
Marceline| Thanks, Finn.
Peppermint Butler| That's cool, you guys, but clean this mess, also, you bums.
Villager Little| He's a gob-gleebin' vampire hugger! We got to tell the town! Book it, Terry! Run, Terry! Run!
Villager Woman| How long do we have to stay in the laundry house, cloud dance?
Cloud Dance| Until Finn and Jake avert the threat. We can't afford to lose more livestock. We're struggling as is to keep our kids fed. Let's just stay in here until the dirty vampire gets what's coming to her.
Villager Mother| But I want to bop her in the nose!
Cloud Dance| Hey, now, it's too dangerous, okay? A small town, we gotta stay close. Each of us play a vital role, and I can't afford losing any of you. Not you, Clubhouse Sandy, or you, Seed Man, or even you, Sandwich Paul.
Sandwich Paul| Sensei Paul.
Cloud Dance| Let's leave the fighting to the fighters, okay, Paul?
Sandwich Paul| That hurts. You don't know I teach aikido.
Terry| Finn's been turned!
Villager| Wha?!
Villager Little| He does the vampire's bidding.
Cloud Dance| Well, there it is. Tonight we burn the beast Marceline. 
Marceline|"  Woof. I can barely stand up. Look at this. It's my new dance. It's called ""I got arthritis."" Ohh. The end."
Finn| You should have hung back with P.B.
Marceline| But I've got a bad feeling like you guys are gonna die without me.
Finn| Dang, Marci. Have some faith. Geez.
Jake| Guys, look.
Cow| Moo!  
Finn| Get it!  You see it?
Jake| No. But what's that?
Finn| Must be its filthy lair.  What's wrong?
Jake| Remember how I said my fear of vampires was based on ignorance?
Finn| Yeah.
Jake| Well, I think that revelation was actually based on true ignorance.
Finn| So you're scared of vampires again?
Jake| Yeah, man, don't be ignorant.
Finn| Come on.
Jake| Okay, but I'm gonna hold on to your shirt.
Finn| Look at these poor babies. What's happening to them?
Jake| Y-y-you tell me, m-man.
Cow| Moo.
Finn| I think they're in the process of being turned, eh?
Jake| Ugh, glob. Something big just dropped in my gut.
Finn| Hang in there, bro.
Jake| I can't be here, man. It's too real.
Finn| Wait, you hear that? Listen.  There!
Horse|  A little help.
Finn|  Jake!  Hey, get back here!  Dang! Lost him! Marci? Hey, Marci, you still out here?
Cloud Dance| She's still out here, all right.
Finn| Oh, hey, man. Did you see a scary beast go by? I chased it out here, but it got away.
Cloud Dance| Oh, we found that beast, and we took care of her real nice You vampire hugger!
Finn| Wait, what?
Cloud Dance| Lookum yonder.
Finn| What the blood?
Marceline|  You dumb bumbags!
Cloud Dance|  Now look at the other yonder.
Finn| Huh? Oh, fudge! You're sick, man! What's wrong with you?
Cloud Dance| What? I'm the good guy here.
Finn| You're gonna explode my friend.
Fat Villagers| Blow her up! Blow her up!
Cloud Dance| Oh, flip, you're right. This is way messed up. Run, Finn! You got to beat the sun!  Go, Finn! Go!
Finn| Aaaaaaah! Marceline, nooooo!
Marceline| Don't let anyone read my diaries. Burn them, Finn! They're embarrassi 
Finn|  Jake... you made this?
Jake|  Yeah!
Finn|  And you buried the treasure right here?
Jake|  Uh-huh.
Finn|  Jake! You're awesome!  So cool...
Finn|  A suitcase?! Oh, man!
Jake|  I found it at the dump and then buried it without lookin' inside.
Finn|  Whoa. Wait a second, man. I know this case.
Finn|  One night, while you were away at Lady's house, I was dancing in the woods...
Ice King|  Evil tapes! Evil!
Finn|  Perchance I saw the Ice King doing something suspicious, so I trailed 'im to the dump, where he buried this case in the ground.
Ice King|  You're evil, tapes! Full of evil secrets! That's why I'm going to bury you where no one will ever find you... under all these boogers!  Wee, hahahahaha! Wee, hahahaha!
Finn|  I waited for him to leave... but he played in those boogers for hours. I decided to come back later for the case... but I lost track of it.
Jake|  Whoa! And I found it?
Finn|  Mm-hmm.
Jake|  Heh-heh-heh. Let's have a secret screening! I'll make some fliers for it!
Jake|  There. Now nobody will bother us.
Finn|  Jake! Jake, come on!
Finn|  Okay. You can play this , right, BMO?
BMO|  Yes, Finn. It goes in my butt!
Finn|  Oh.
Jake|  This is so exciting!
Ice King|  Hello, dear diary. Pretty good day so far. Got up bright and early and had a healthy and slimming breakfast, did fourteen minutes of cardio ...
Jake|   Dude... what are we watchin'?
Finn|  I think it's the Ice King's diary.
Ice King|  ...I mean, I'm not gonna win carpenter of the year or anything, but it's a place to hang up the old toothbrush.
Penguin|  Wenk. 
Ice King|  Gunther? Hey, Gunther. Get-get away from the camera, sweetie. Papa's recording his innermost thoughts. 'Member? I explained this to you?  Hey, Gunther?  GUNTHER!!!
Penguin|  Wenk.
Ice King|   Well, anyway, as you can see, I'm not wearing my—
Penguin|  Wenk.
Ice King|   I'm not wearing my—
Penguin|  Wenk wenk.
Ice King|  Sweetie, I raised my voice because you were giving me the silent treatment. You understand?
Penguin|  Wenk.
Ice King|  I love you.
Jake|  Can we fast-forward?
Finn|  No, man, we might miss something.
Ice King|   There must be more to life than this...
Penguin|  Wenk.
Ice King|  I know. You don't like when I'm contemplative. ...C-contemplative... No, con-temp-la—Let's put on a play!
Jake|  What?!?
Ice King|   Oh, Ice King! You're so cool! You take such good care of yourself! I wanna be with you!
Penguin|  Wenk. Wenk wenk. 
Ice King|  No, Gunther, beard stays on.
Penguin|  Wenk.
Ice King|  Gunther, I need ya to wear the beard!
Penguin|  Wenk!
Ice King|  Gunther!
Jake|  Hey, pause it, BMO.
Finn|  There's gotta be some evil secrets in here. I wanna keep watching.
Jake|  Okay... Well, why don't I make us some snacks? So I don't have to watch... this...
BMO|  Can we sit on the floor? I feel so far away from you guys!
Penguin|  Wenk.
Ice King|"   Now hold still...  You moved! Hey, what's this?  ""Secret tapes""?! I wanna watch! I'll catch ya later, Gunther! "
Penguin|  Wenk!
Ice King|  Gunther, no! Gunther...  Dance pa—  GUNTHER!  Dance party! 
Finn|  Thanks, Gunther.
Jake|   You're Gunther. 
Ice King|  Oh, fine! Who needs you? More dance party for us, right, Gunther?  Oh... Eh...  May I have this dance? Heh! 
Finn|  There's probably some evil secrets coming up.  Someone wants to see the secret tapes!
Jake|  What? Oh, but I was so clear in my flier!
BMO|  Let's peek through the window and check who it is! Maybe it's just pizza.
Finn|  Right!
Jake|  Wait! Wait!
Finn & BMO|  What?
Jake|  You guys are checking too loud!
Finn|   Oh! You're right.  More quietly!
BMO|  I am quieter now.
Jake|  Cool.
Ice King|  Hey, guys, it's me. Can I come in and watch the secret tapes with you? I brought some gifts! 
Finn & Jake|  Aah!
Finn|  Okay. If we're quiet long enough, Ice King will think no one's home and go away.
Ice King|  Eh... No one's home. Guess I'll go away. 
Ice King|   Huh?
Finn|  Just turn your alarm off!
Ice King|  Hmm. That sounds like BMO! 
BMO|  My alarm says it's time for Finn's bath. Finn, get naked.
Finn|   No, just hit your snooze button!
BMO|  I cannot self-snooze. It's against my programming.
Finn|   Well, then, tell me how to do it!
BMO|  Press and hold.  Then, press the button on top of my head.  I'm sorry. ...We can still take a bath...
Finn|  He must know we're watching his tapes. We need to find his secrets faster.
Ice King|  Oh, diary! Thank you for listening to me!
Finn|  Fast-forward, BMO.
Finn|  Play, BMO.
Ice King|  So there we are. Turtle Princess is frozen and in my little ice wheelbarrow, and there was... magic in the air. We were both feeling it.  But before I could leave the library, Finn and Jake show up. You know how Jake is. Stretch this, stretch that, bah! He knocks off my crown and then Finn bonks me on the nose. Still hurts, too. The worst part is Turtle Princess took away my library card!  You know, dear diary, I'm starting to worry that all these entries sound exactly the same, and that my life is just me running in place on some... giant hamster wheel.
Jake|   Fast-forward, BMO.
Jake|  I'm gonna take a nap...
Finn|  No! These tapes are important! We just don't know why yet. BMO, fast-forward to triple speed!
BMO|  Okay.
Finn|  BMO, play normal speed.
Ice King|   Come on, baby... in the pocket...  I can't do it...
Jake|  Maybe he's talkin' in secret code.
Finn|  Telling evil secrets in secret code... He's brilliant!
Jake|  Well, how do we decode the secrets?
BMO|   Why don't we call others for help?
Finn|  BMO, you're brilliant!
Jake|  Well, who do we call?
Finn|  Um... The smartest person we know, Princess Bubblegum!  She's brilliant...
Finn|  Hey, Princess Bubblegum.
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey, Finn.
Finn|  Jake and I found a bunch of secret tapes! We were wondering if you'd help us decode them.
Princess Bubblegum|  Codes?
Jake|   Yeah, they're really stupid, but, y'know... Maybe they're encoded or whateva.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, you called the right person. I know a lot about codes. Let's start with—
Finn|  What?
Jake|   Ohh...
Finn|  Hey, Princess. We got disconnected.
Ice King|   Hello, Finny. 
Finn & Jake|  Hey/Uhhh, you sound weird!
Ice King|  Must be a bad connection. That's why we were disconnected earlier on the telephone.
BMO|  Ice King is on the phone outside!
Finn|   So... how's the weather in Candy Kingdom?
Ice King|   Oh, the usual. There's ice everywhere and it smells like penguins!
Finn|  The only thing that smells like penguins is you, Ice King!!
Ice King|   How did you—
Finn|  What're you doing?!
Ice King|  I wanna watch secret tapes with you guys. It'll be nice.
Finn|  No, man!
Ice King|  But—
Finn|   He doesn't know that we're watching his tapes. We gotta find these evil secrets before he uses them against us!
Ice King|  Oh... Fine. No more nice. NOW YOU GET ICE!!  Try watching those tapes with FROZEN EYEBALLS!
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, okay, I'm up.  Ah! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey, everybody. I've asked you here today because you are the best of the best.
Princess Bubblegum|  Anyway, recent data shows an increased chance of threat to the Candy Kingdom.
Finn|  
Princess Bubblegum|  So I'm developing a new defense.  I've installed sleeping gas in the Gumball Guardians. If any bum tries to attack us, they will be sprayed without mercy. Isn't that nice? The only thing is the gas will spread and knock out anyone who breathes it—anyone but you guys, my trained elite. So watch closely. I'm gonna show you all how to overcome the gas  with sheer willpower.  Hit it!
Princess Bubblegum|"  Now make a fist with your brain and punch against sleepy times, saying, ""No! NOOO! NOOOOO! Don't go on gentle into that good night."""
Cinnamon Bun|   Hi!
Marceline|   Yo, Bubblegum! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Marceline! You're up late.
Marceline|   No time for chitchat. Let's hang out—right now.
Princess Bubblegum|  Hmm, I don't know. I'm, uh, kinda busy. 
Cinnamon Bun|  Uh,  hi.
Marceline|  Listen, Bub-Bubs. I tracked down Maja the Sky Witch.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, what?!
Marceline|  Yeah, I tailed her to an enchanted forest, but it's all jammed up with barrier spells.
Princess Bubblegum|  Ohhh, I think I see where this is going.
Marceline|  Well, you love getting out your big brain and... and... I just thought it'd be cool to spend some quality time with you.  I need your help, okay?
Princess Bubblegum|  But why are you so interested in finding Maja?
Marceline|  It's just really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really important to me.
Princess Bubblegum|  Whoa. Okay, but—
Marceline|  Come on, I got your pack-pack. 
Princess Bubblegum|  Um, sure, but—
Marceline|"  Hold on to that ""but,"" PB. "
Princess Bubblegum|   Whee!
Cinnamon Bun|   Haha! Whee.
Marceline|  Gah! Something's wrong. Huh? Hey!  This stuff—it's like a brick wall!  Let's just blow the whole thing up.
Princess Bubblegum|   Hmmm.  It's a Sleeping Gate Bramble.
Marceline|  How do we kill it?
Princess Bubblegum|  All we have to do is take the path of least resistance.
Marceline|   Alright, so where is it—the path?
Princess Bubblegum|  It's in here  and in here . Now  take a deep breath  and be passive. 
Marceline|    Grrrr! 
Princess Bubblegum|   Hello, friend. Trouble relaxing? How 'bout a cup of chamomile tea? 
Marceline|   Wow! Wild digs.
Princess Bubblegum|   Tell me about it. My googoomamameter is going babies. And look at my watch! 
Marceline|  It's... pink.
Princess Bubblegum|  It's running backwards. There's serious witchery afoot here.
Marceline|  Come on, Princess. We don't got all night. 
Marceline|    
Princess Bubblegum|  What are those things?
Marceline|  Totem cairns.
Marceline|  That's Maja's Crabbit Familiar.
Princess Bubblegum|  Wibba-wha?
Hambo|  Marceline! It's me!
Marceline|  Hambo!
Hambo|  Yeah, girl. What took you so long? I thought you gave up on me.
Princess Bubblegum|  Your teddy bear?
Marceline|  I'm sorry, man! 
Princess Bubblegum|   Yo, wait a sec!
Marceline|   WHAT?!
Princess Bubblegum| Marcy, how old are you? It's a trick, right? Come on!
Hambo|  Help me out, dum-dum!  Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo
Marceline|   Get off!  Buddy!
Princess Bubblegum|   NO!
Marceline|    BONNIE!
Marceline|  You killed him?
Princess Bubblegum|  Don't be dense! Hambo can't even talk! Snap out of it, girl.
Marceline|  He's been with a witch this whole time. Maybe he can talk now.
Princess Bubblegum|  That's seriously what this is about? Rescuing your old teddy bear?
Marceline|  Yeah. Sorry I didn't tell you. You might not have come otherwise.
Princess Bubblegum|  Um, yeah. Raggedy Princess can make you a new Hambo in, like, three seconds... or Raggedy Princess can be your new Hambo. She'd do it, too. That girl's got, like, zero self-respect.  That's mean—don't tell her I said that.
Marceline|  I'm not getting a new Hambo. There's only one Hambo.
Princess Bubblegum|  It's just a doll.
Marceline|   See this?   Voooooooo...
Princess Bubblegum|  What's that? You gonna bop me one?
Marceline|  It's comin' in for a landing. What'cha gonna do, PB? Wanna keep dissing Hambo?
Princess Bubblegum|    I'm sorry, Marceline. Let's go get Hambo.
Marceline|   Disengage.
Princess Bubblegum|  We should track that bird-rabbit thing.
Marceline|  Right.
Princess Bubblegum|   Hmm.  Bang.  There goes some broken branches. It left a trail.
Marceline|  I see it. 
Princess Bubblegum|   Hey! Hold on now!  This bag's mad heavy!
Marceline|   
Princess Bubblegum|  Glommit!    MARCELINE!  I thought you needed my help.  Huh.  Nice trick, Maja.  You in there, Marceline? Hyup! 
Princess Bubblegum|   WHOAAAA!  Woof.   Okay, PB, use your brain. Where would this witch keep Hambo? Break it down.  Micro... and macro... the picture... becomes... clear... and... call it!  Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, wait...  yes. 
Marceline|  Where are you, Maja, you creep?  Oof.  What?  Hambo!  No!
Crabbit|  Caw, caw!
Marceline|  You again. I'LL KILL YOU! Give me Ham— Uh! 
Princess Bubblegum|"  Jeez, man. This must be all of her stolen junk. Ugh, what a creep.  Psh, a Ford Broncus.  Hmm...  Whoa!  ""My Privates""? Come here, biddy.  Bam. Whoops!  What the—?  Invoices?  Receipts?  ""Zumma zoom bleep blop for the purchase of Hambo."" Whoa, WHAT?!"
Maja|  That's my private box. Maja's mitts only, ya goof.
Princess Bubblegum|  So you purchased Hambo? From some weenus named Ash?
Maja|  That's right. He was a weenus so I wrote it on there as my personal joke.  But the sale is still legit. Hambo's mine! His body's all juice-logged with sentimental affection—a savory spell spice. So get out of my face, alright?
Princess Bubblegum|  Where's Marceline?
Maja|  She's busy with my Crabbit... crow-bit... crow-rabbit. I knew that tranch wouldn't respect my proof of purchase. So what about you, bozo?
Princess Bubblegum|  By the laws of my kingdom, I must honor the exchange of goods for legal tender. But guess what—I'm not leaving without Hambo.
Maja|   So what are you gonna do about it?
Princess Bubblegum|   I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
Princess Bubblegum|  Marceline!  Yoink!
Marceline|   Hambo!  Oh, it's me, buddy!   How did you—?
Princess Bubblegum|  I took care of it.  Let's bust out.
Crabbit|   They got away with your  Hambo.
Maja|  Huh-duh! I let them!
Crabbit|  You what?
Maja|  I made a trade... for this!  Bing!  Mmmmm.  Sentimental freshness! Ah, the psychic resonance on Hambo is nothing  compared to this baby!  WHOO! Hahahaha!
Crabbit|  Listen, Maja. I am not your familiar anymore. I wanna be a dancer.
Maja|  That's cool. Then why don't you dance to this?! 
Crabbit|  AAAH!
Maja|  Nice moves!  Now you're the weenus!  Hey, don't go!  Ahahahahaha! I'm cookin' up something big, Crabbit! This is my victory lap! Ahahahahaha!
Princess Bubblegum|   Alright, guys. Hammer all these safety signs around this dungeon hole. I've gotta jet off on my swan to take care of some royal junk.
Finn|  You got it, Princess.
Jake|  Whatever you want, mama.
Princess Bubblegum|  Bubblegum, away!!
Jake|  Ow. Ow. Ow.
Finn|  There. That's the last sign, Jake. Now no one will go down this hole, ever. Probably a lot of dangerous, awesome stuff down this hole. I better go take a look.
Jake|  Don't, dude. For you see, that's the secret entrance to the Dungeon of the Crystal Eye!
Finn|  Whoa.
Jake|  Legend has it that the eye rests in the deepest chamber of this accursed dungeon. Man, we shouldn't even be talkin' about it, 'cause it's lunch time. 
Finn|  The crystal eye. I wanna meet this dungeon.
Jake|  Maybe after lunch.
Finn|  Eh, I'll skip lunch. Just catch up with me when you are finished.
Jake|  *Pfft* Yeah, right.
Finn|  What?
Jake|  Without the aid of my magnificent powers...  ...Huh? Huh? You'd get killed down there.
Finn|  Hey! I can do things without you! You wanna bet I can't?
Jake|  Nope. Come get your sandwich.  Listen to Jake, Finn. He only wants what's best for--  Ahh! Help me! Ahh! Come put her out of her misery, dude!
Finn|  We are betting! I bet that I'll get that crystal eye and be back within 11 minutes.  Ready set go! 
Jake|   I better go after him.
Jake|  No, Jake! Stay here, with me...
Jake|  Oh, my... 
Finn|  Dungeons! Chambers! Woah.  Evil creatures!  Treasure chests! 
Finn|  Doorways!  Traps!  I'm in my elemeeeeeeeeent!! 
Finn|  Aww!
Finn|   Oh?
Finn|  Whoa! Somebody come pick up your freaky cat.
Demon Cat|  Greetings, Frank the Human Boy.
Finn|  How did you almost know my name?!
Demon Cat|  I have approximate knowledge of many things. For instance, I know that I am possibly going to slay you and munch on your eyeballs. 
Finn|  Huh, yeah right. That sounds like idiot talk!
Demon Cat|  You're trespassing on my dungeon, manling. And I am the thing...  ...you should be afraid of.
Finn|  You can't hurt me! I'm a radical boy on a mission for the crystal eye!
Demon Cat|  I'm going to unzip your skin and wear you like a little coat.
Finn|  Unzip this! 
Finn|  Bleep!  OOF!
Demon Cat|  Now, you DIE!! 
Demon Cat|  Wait a minute.  Is that dog smell?! You... you have a dog with you? I'm outta here! 
Finn|  Yeah, right! Good excuse! Slaps, that cat was kicking my buns! And it might have finished my buns if it weren't for Jake's stank. Dang it, Jake! I'll get that crystal eye on my own! With my own odors.  Hmm, no to skeletal remains door.  No to giant monster mouth door.  Oh! Giant key door it is!
Finn|  If Jake was here, he could stretch his hand into a key and open it.  Yeah! Key hand!  Ouch!  Hey! What the jug is that?
Finn|  Oh, sweet, the key!
Finn|  Ew, jelly cube?!  Come on! Give it to me! Don't flaunt it if you're not gonna give it up!  I'll never get that crystal eye! No. No, I just gotta stay pumped.  Pump it up, pump it up! Whoo! Whoo! Shake it! Shake it! Ahh!  Steady, Finn. This place is probably more creeped out of you than you are of it. 
Bucket Knight|  Halt! Come no further adventurer, for you see none can defeat... the Bucket Knight! 
Finn|  Okay, then I won't fight you.
Bucket Knight|  No! You must challenge me to-- 
Finn|  Hey cutie, do you know how to get to the crystal eye from here?
Bucket Knight|  Yes, it's through that door over there, but-- 
Finn|  Thanks!
Bucket Knight|  Hey! You can't pass through that door with out battling me!
Finn|  Yes, I can. Because I'm huge compared to you.
Bucket Knight|   Just add water and...  ...exponential growth!
Finn|  Aw, buckets.
Bucket Knight|  Now, activate thine own powers, and we shall engage in thrilling single combat!
Finn|   Heh, thing is... I don't really... have any powers.
Bucket Knight|   I see...
Finn|  AAAAH!! Dang it, Jake wouldn't be running! He'd grow all big, and sock you right in the nose hole!  Aw, nutzoids!  Come on! All aboard the knuckle train to fist planet! 
Finn|  Oww... I rode the knuckle train? But... I... I'm in my element.
Finn|  AHHHHH!!!! Ow! OW! Ow! OW! Ow! Uhh! That... sucked.  Alright, Finn, you're in a heavy pickle here. You don't have Jake, and you're on your own. But you can still handle this. You can still get that crystal eye! 
Demon Cat|"  Hey, my dinner is back. And your dog isn't with you! That's what you said, right? Jack the Dog is not ""accompanying"" you?"
Finn|  You mean Jake?
Demon Cat|  Jake, Jack, whatever. He's not here, which means I'm going to rip your heart out. 
Finn|  Crud, crud, crud, crud, crud!
Demon Cat|  You can't hide from me, Jim. I know almost everything, remember? I know exactly where you might be, Jim. I'm about to pounce on you.
Demon Cat|  One... two... three!  Aw, man! I thought you'd be behind this rock. Hmm...  Alright. I know where you are now! And I'm about to pounce again!  One... two... three!  Aw, man! Well, there's only a few more places to look.
Finn|  Oh, Jake... I'm such a fool. A silly, silly fool.  Who the heck--?!
Guardian Angel|  Hey, it's okay. Shh, I'm your guardian angel, Finn. I'm here to save you.
Finn|  Re...really?
Guardian Angel|  Mmm-hm. Come here, let the angel pick you up.
Finn|  Okay.  This is radical.
Guardian Angel|  Are you comfortable? Would you like some snacks?
Finn|  I'm fine, thank you.
Guardian Angel|  Here, let me clean you up, and mend your clothes. 
Finn|  Ha ha ha ha ha!
Guardian Angel|  I'm taking you to the chamber of the Crystal Eye....
Finn| Aww, yeah!
Guardian Angel|  ... where I'm going to cook you and eat your flesh.
Finn|  Wow... Wait! What??!
Guardian Angel|  Trust in your  guardian angel!
Finn|  Put me down, lady!
Guardian Angel|  As you wish.
Finn|  Man, everybody wants to eat me up. It's probably 'cause I'm so sweet.
Guardian Angel|  Now for little kid soup.  The secret is a low flame over a long period.
Finn|  That's Jake's secret, too. I sure hope he saves me.
Guardian Angel|   I will save thee, Finn.
Finn|  Lady, you are sick! Oh, Jake.
Jake|  What?
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|  Finn!
Finn|  What are you doing here?!
Jake|  I was looking for you, knucklehead! I was so worried, that right after lunch, I plunged into the dungeon after you.
Jake|  Strangest thing, though, I kept runnin' into obstacles.
Reaper|  Choose your dueling weapon!
Jake|  Uh... I choose... sandwich! 
Jake|   The challenges were impossible for me.
Jake|"   But you would have blown right through. I kept thinking to myself, ""What would Finn do?"" Just...eh, frustrating. Know what I mean?"
Finn|  Yeah... I think I do. 
Finn|  Now let's find a way out of this cage.
Jake|  I'll get us out with Key Hand! 
Finn|  I really don't see any key holes on this cage.
Jake|  Not a problem, man. Lock Hand!
Finn|   I'll get us out of here, with carrot hand!
Jake|  Alright, man. Let's go! We've still got a couple minutes left to steal that crystal eye and win your bet!
Finn|  Wait! You'd help me win a bet that I made that I said I could accomplish something without you?
Jake|  Just hop on my powdered doughnut, boy!
Finn|  Cling!
Jake|  Alright, man. Let's give this crystal eye the old friendship lift.
Finn|  Okay.
Both|  Friendship, go!
Finn|  If I die, I'll have died with my best friend!
Jake|  Me, too!
Princess Bubblegum|  Get on my swan!
Princess Bubblegum|  I hope you learned a lesson from all this!
Both|  Uh, we learned that working together is better. Heh, whatever.
Jake|   Looks like that's not the answer she wanted.
Finn|  Uhh... I learned that you're a very... intelligent princess?
Princess Bubblegum|  You're darn right I am. Princess Bubblegum, away!!
Jake|  Don't forget LSP's diet cola.
Finn|  I won't. I really do love Finn and Jake Movie Club.
Finn|  Okay, everybody. Apple juice for Tree Trunks.  Diet soda for LSP.
Lumpy Space Princess|   Ehh.
Finn|  What did you order, PB?
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, I brought my own. 
Finn|  Huh.
Jake|  Ice latte for my lady. 
Finn|  Tomato juice for Marceline. 
Marceline|  Thanks, Finn.
Finn|  Hot cocoa for BMO.
BMO|   This does compute.
Finn|  And finally, a thimble of milk for Shelby, the worm who lives in Jake's viola.
Shelby|  You can just call me Shelby.
Finn|  Jake...
Jake|  We're so excited that you could be here tonight for Finn and Jake's Movie Club's feature presentation...
Finn & Jake|  Heat Signature 3.
Marceline|  Oh, with the submarine?
Princess Bubblegum|  Sounds great.
Lady Rainicorn| 재밌겠는데? 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Get on with it!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Princess Bubblegum's in my seat.
Finn|  We decided last time No reserved seating. First come, first served.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Grr. 
Princess Bubblegum|  What's that?
Finn|  Just stuff that comes at the beginning of the movies.
Jake|  Yeah, that's on all the movies we dig up.
Princess Bubblegum|  I don't know. It seems pretty important, Finn.
Finn|  Alright, let's take a look.
Jake|  Pause, BMO.
Finn & Jake|"  ""Warning. Federal law provides severe and criminal penalties for the unauthorized exhibition of copyrighted motion pictures."""
Finn|  Alright, well, goodbye.
Jake|  Sorry we had to cancel. 
Finn|  We've been showing these films unauthorized.
Jake|  But these movies are before the Great Mushroom War.
Finn|  We should still respect authority, mang.
Finn|  Yeah?
Princess Bubblegum|  Are we meeting next week to watch a movie?
Finn|  Uhh... Uh, yeah. Maybe. I think so.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Finn, don't cancel movie club! I've literally been having the time of my life.
Lady Rainicorn|  아, 너무 좋았는데. 
Finn|  Calm down, y'all. We're gonna have Finn and Jake Movie Club next week for sure. Jake and I just have to find a movie without that warning.
Jake|  Dude, we've never found a movie without that warning.
Finn|  We're not gonna find a movie, Jake.
Jake|  Well, what are we gonna do?
Finn|   We're gonna make one!
Jake|  Wowp!
Finn & Jake|  Movie filming time!
Finn|  Okay, BMO. Turn to your right, and start filming.
Jake|  Start to truck in. Keep going. Keep truckin' in, BMO.
Candy People|  Huh?
Finn|  That was awesome, BMO.
Jake|  Yeah. Fantastic, super.
Jake|  Don't lose her, BMO!
Finn|  Front shot! Front shot! Film the clouds. Don't forget the little one.
Jake|  BMO! BMO, you're gonna miss it! Over there to your right.
Finn|  Oh, we're gonna miss it. Hurry, BMO!
Finn|  Don't lose it. Oh, it looks like it's gonna fall. Follow it!
Jake|  Look over there. Across the river.
Finn|  BMO, forget about the coin. Film that over there!
Finn|  Zoom in.  Weird. Let's get some more footage.
Ice Cream|  Like that?
Finn & Jake|  Yeah, perfect.
Ice Cream|  Are you, are you sure?
Finn & Jake|  Yeah, look great.
Ice Cream|  W-w-wait. How about this?
Finn & Jake|  That's even better!
Finn|  Uhh, what do you think?
Jake|  I don't get it. It's just a bunch of random junk.
Finn|  Yeah, I'm not engaged. I need to see something that reflects life as it is, but, you know, entertaining.
Jake|  Yeah, like a romantic comedy.
Finn|  Exactly. An action adventure.
Jake|  Wait, that's not what I said.
Finn|  Let's get to filming!
Finn|   Okay, Slime Princess! In this scene, you're gonna leap over to that vine, swim over the crocodiles, do a triple flip with a full twist and land clean. Don't fall in the water, or you'll get eaten alive. Action!
Finn|  No! No smooching! Cut.
Jake|  I thought it was great.
Finn|  No, we can't use any of it.
Jake|  I think we should use all of it.
Finn|  No, not all. We should throw away the parts where Slime Princess was smoochin'. That was dumb.
Jake|  What?
Finn|  Duuuumb-ah. 
Jake|  Okay, you're having a picnic, you're in love but you can't admit it. So you're having a playful food fight. And action.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Why did you do that?
Jake|  Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut, that was not what I wanted!
Finn|  That was awesome! We need to shoot more stuff like that.
Jake|   What's next?
Finn|  Okay PB, move back a little.  Stop. 
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn.
Finn|  Yeah.
Princess Bubblegum|  How does this work?
Finn|  Umm, Jake's gonna get the frog to hop toward him  and when he does, you're gonna run along side the chariot and it's gonna look like you're driving it.
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay.
Jake|  Hey, Finn.
Finn|  Yeah.
Jake|"  How 'bout when the chariot takes off, she says something like, ""Mmm, check, please."""
Finn|  What? No, that's terrible.  And action!
Princess Bubblegum|  Check, please...?
Finn|  Hah, Jake. You... you brought the fly in too close!
Jake|  I'm sorry.
Finn|  Well, help me catch 'im.
Jake|  Well, I thought it was funny.
Finn|  This isn't a comedy!
Jake|  Not the way you're shootin' it.
Finn|  Look, just help me catch this guy.
Jake|  All right, but after this we do my part.
Jake|   Okay, everyone. It's been a long day. A lot of...  A lot of running around, chasing frogs . But we are makin' a movie, and this is the big wedding scene. Mr. Cupcake, you're playing Todd Johnson.
Mr. Cupcake|  Yes.
Jake|  And Lady, you confess that you never loved Todd Johnson and that you were just trying to win a bet with your snooty socialite friends.
Lady Rainicorn|  알았어, 제이크. 
Jake|"  And then, you both realize you do love each other and you both say ""I do."" And then Shelby, you say..."
Shelby|  Check, please.
Jake|  Heh, heh, heh. Yeah. Don't forget to look right at the camera and slap your cheeks like this.  And 1, 2, 3 action!
Shelby|  Do you, Todd Johnson, take this Rainicorn to be your lawfully married wife?
Jake|  Lady! Cut! Cut, cut, cut!  I didn't tell you to flex out!
Lady Rainicorn|   자기야, 흥분하지 마. 
Jake|  No, I don't like the way he's flexing at you.
Mr. Cupcake|  I don't hear her complaining.
Jake|  Why you... GAAH!
Shelby|  Check, please.
Finn|  How much longer till you finish editing, BMO?
BMO|  About twenty hours.
Finn|  Twenty hours?!
BMO|  Yeah, you guys shot a lot of footage. About twenty hours.
Finn|  Jake, let's talk about our movie.
Jake|  Okay.
Finn|  I think we shot a lot of great stuff.
Jake|  Uh-huh.
Finn|  But I'm thinkin' only half of it is usable.
Jake|  Me, too.
Finn|  Really?
Jake|  Yeah, I was just thinking that.
Finn|  That's great!
Jake|  I know.
Finn|  You actually agree it's an action adventure!
Jake|  Yep, it—wait! No!
Finn|  What?
Jake|  Romantic comedy!
Finn|  What?!
Jake|"  What do you mean ""what""?!"
Finn|  Who's right, BMO?
Jake|  Yeah, me or Finn?
Finn|  We'll ask him when he wakes up.
Jake|"  Why wait?  ""Dear BMO, Please use only the best footage when cutting the movie. Love, Jake."""
Finn|"  ""And Finn."""
Jake|  See you at the movie club, then.
Finn|  Oh, I'll be there.
Jake|  As will I.
Finn|  As will I, as well.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Yes. Oh, yes. Oh, I can't wait. Oh, I can't wait!
Jake|  Heh heh. Alright, thanks again everyone for coming to...  movie night! I hope y'all are in the mood to laugh.
Finn| I hope y'all are ready to be on the edge of your seats for tonight's action adventure film.
Jake|  It's, ahh, it's more of a romantic comedy. Right, BMO?
BMO|  Eeee...
Finn|  Well, I guess we'll see!
Jake|  Yeah, I guess we will. Start the movie, BMO.
Lumpy Space Princess|   It's a little awkward.
Lumpy Space Princess|   Oh, my gosh!
Finn|  BMO's right. Fighting over this movie junk is dumb. I'm sorry, man.
Jake|  Me too, dude.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, my gosh, you guys. I can't wait till next week's movie club.
BMO|  Check, please.
Jake|  That's a good one, BMO!
Cuber|   Hmm?  Oh, greeble bayble grapes. You're just in time. Bayble Cuber's going to watch an inkle dribble adventure from days of old on my holo-pyramid viewer. Five stories each relating to one special theme. See if you graybles can guess the theme by the end of the episode, okay? Now sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.
Finn|  Okay, BMO,  be back in an hour. You sure you don't need anything from the Grocery Kingdom?
BMO|  No, I don't need anything. Thank you. Okay, goodbye, Finn and Jake!
Finn|  Bye, BMO!
Jake|  Yeah, see ya later, BMO!
BMO|  Finn? Jake?  Well, hello there. Oh, hello! Who are you? My name is Football. What's yours? I am BMO.  BMO, are you a robot?  Oh, no, Football! I am a little living boy! Oh! That sounds wonderful, BMO! Will you teach me about being alive? Yes, Football! Watch me!  Pee-ing! Oh, BMO, that's fantastic!  Oh, thank you, Football! It's really nothing. 
Jake|  What the...?
Finn|  See, man? I told you.
Jake|  This is nuts. Plus, he's usin' my toothbrush!
Finn|  No, man. That's my toothbrush. 
Finn & Jake|   UGH!
Finn|"   ""Prove that BMO does weird junk when nobody is around."" Check! "
Jake|  High-five, buddy!
Finn|  That was pretty weak.
Jake|  Yeah. I was thinkin' the same thing.
Finn|  You wanna give it another go?
Jake|  Yeah.
Finn|  That was better... but we can do better.
Jake|  You mean even better.
Finn|  Let's back on up and run at each other!
Jake|  Okay!
Finn & Jake|   Aaaaaahhhh....  ZAH!!
Jake|  Ooh, kinda stings!
Finn|  I like the pain.
Jake|  Let's do another one.
Finn|  Ready!?
Jake|  Yeah!
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|  Yeah?
Finn|  I know how we can do the most ultimate high-five ever!!
Jake|  You've gone crazy mad with power lust! And I'm lovin' it!!
Finn|   You ready to do this, dude!?
Jake|   I've been ready this whole time, dude! Just waitin' you to say when you're—
Finn|  SUPER-ULTIMATE HIGH-FIVE GO!!!
Princess Bubblegum|  Ugh...
Peppermint Butler|  A glass of delicious, nourishing water for my lady—  AAH!! 
Princess Bubblegum|   Oh, yes!
Cow|  Oh, man... Uh... oh, boy...  Ugh... Oh, my Glob! Oh, Glob...
Princess Bubblegum|  Cheeeeese...
Princess Bubblegum|  Ding ding ding ding ding.
Princess Bubblegum|  Ha ha! Jingo-jango!
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeast on third, flour on first, swell the dough, fit to burst! Awhoooooo!
Princess Bubblegum|   Well... this is it, Cinnamon Bun. The most perfect sandwich that has ever existed, or ever will exist within the confines of space-time. Will you do the honors?
Cinnamon Bun|  Okay. 
Princess Bubblegum|   But... but you... you didn't... y-y-you didn't even... taste it...
Cinnamon Bun|  Thanks, Princess. Peace out.
Ice King|  Blegh, Gunter, something stinks!  Gunter, do you smell that?  GUNTER, STOP PLAYING THE KEYBOARD!!  Smells like it's comin' from...  Gunter, are you blowin' it up in here?  You are nasty, Gunter! You got a nasty booty, mister! Nasty!  Oh, don't be sad, stinky. Come with daddy and I'll make it aaaall better.
Ice King|  Goodbye, Gunter. Sorry, sweetie, but I'm never gonna get any princesses if you're stinkin' up the place!  Blaaaah, it still stinks in here! What the heck! Where's that smell comin' from?!  Oh, it's me. I smell horrible.
Ice King|  Scrub, penguins! Scrub harder! We are not stopping until the stench is completely gone!
Ice King|   Clean clean, clean ka-clean.  Gunter! Guess what? It was me who was smelly, not you!
Penguin|   Wenk.
Ice King|  Sorry. I thought you had a stank booty, Gunter. My bad. Although I have no idea how my armpits got so stinky.
Lumpy Space Princess|"  Everyone's worthless at this talent show. I'm totally gonna win when I sing,  ""These lumps! I know you wanna slump up on these lumps! But you can't 'cause you're a chump! A chuuump!"""
Candy Magician|  You're totally gonna win, LSP.
Peppermint Butler|  Thank you, Marc. You made two out of ten baskets.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Now it's time for me to kill it!
Peppermint Butler|  Hold on, LSP, you're not up next. These girls are.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Wha—THAT'S MY SONG!!
Cinnamon Bun|  That sounds good in my eardrums!
Lumpy Space Princess|   ...These lumps. I know you wanna slump up on these lumps...
Cinnamon Bun|  Hey!! We just heard this song!!
Lumpy Space Princess|  No... I... I was gonna do it first!  NO! NO!
Cinnamon Bun|  RIP-OFF!!!
Lumpy Space Princess|  I WAS GONNA DO THE SONG FIRST!!
Marshmallow kid|  Huh?!
Crowd|  Whooooaaaa...
Donut Guy|  That's amazing!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Huh?
Crowd|  LSP! LSP!
Peppermint Butler|  That was the most amazing thing ever! LSP wins!!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Really?! Oh, my gosh, you guys!! I just wanna thank y'all so much! It means so much to me! And I just wanted to say I... I...
Peppermint Butler|  Finn and Jake win the talent show!
Lumpy Space Princess|  WHAT?!?!
Finn|   Awesome...
Jake|   That... was... awesome...
Cuber|   Oh, bayble, that was easy, wasn't it? Slimmin'? I'm glad we all guessed the theme so easily. What? You haven't guessed it? Oh. I'm sorry. Well, pause your viewer now to think about it before I belayble it to you.  The theme was the five senses! You see? Look. BMO saw his reflection. Finn and Jake touched their hands together! The Princess made a tasty sandwich! The blue guy smelled bad! And the other thing heard music. Oh, what a treat! Okay, well I'll see you trimpy flimmers on triode flimpin' the diode!
Marceline| Wait, I was hunting a vampire...  The Moon.
Princess Bubblegum| Cut it out! That's not helping her.
Finn| But Mom and Dad always burped on us.
Jake| It's a cure-all!
Princess Bubblegum| Sorry, guys. There are no cure-alls. Your parents were just burping on you for kicks.
Jake| Oh, yeah, that makes sense.  Oh, sorry, last one.
Princess Bubblegum| Huh!  What did you eat, Jake?!
Jake| Hey, now! I pride myself in having nice-smelling burps. Just kidding.
Princess Bubblegum|" Pride... hmm. Do you guys know what ""hubris"" is?"
Finn| It's like an old-timey deity who weighed your deeds on a scale.
Princess Bubblegum| No. It means excessive pride or arrogance.
Lumpy Space Princess| That's like you, PB.
Finn| Dude.
Princess Bubblegum| No, it's true. I believed in myself so much that I was blind to the possible consequences.
Lumpy Space Princess| Don't believe in yourself so much then, Dum-dum.
Princess Bubblegum|  Now my best friend is dying of poison because of me.
Jake| That ain't true, PB. Marcy took a risk, and you helped her because you're her friend. Real friends take each other to the edge of death—'cause death is life! Right, Finn?
Finn| Shoot, yeah! I get poisoned all the time just doing the dishes!
Peppermint Butler| I get poisoned on purpose, for research. I have a poison lab back at the castle.
Princess Bubblegum| Well, let's get our butts over there then! Find The Moon, Finn. We'll work on an antidote. You guys take her back to the poison lab. Maybe we can extract her healing powers.
Finn| Word!
Lumpy Space Princess| Hey, wait! What should I do? You guys? 
Finn| Moon pearls... We're on her trail.
Jake| Gross!
Finn| I think they're pretty.
Jake| What if they're, like, her boogers... or worse?
Finn| Come on, Jake.
Jake| Ew, ew, ew, ew! Sometimes I think vampires were invented just to torment me.
Finn| Whoa. I don't think so, man. I think you might have a hubrits.
Jake| I'm just saying it's a possibility.
Finn| Hey, look! The moon's pontoon.
Jake| See?! I hate it! What it this, some hut the Moon plopped out of her bod?
Finn| I don't think so. This mummy job looks like it used to belong to that mummy job.
Jake| Still hate it. What's that, pickles? Ew. Yeah, that's her.
Jake| Shouldn't she, like, explode or something?
Finn| She just healted that sword right out of her bod! Let's try frying her up in the sun.
Jake| Oh, yeah.
Finn and Jake| Wow!
Jake| How are we supposed to destroy this stay-fresh creep?
Finn| Hmm. Let's stick with P.B.'s plan and try staking her a bunch of different ways.
King of Ooo| Hmm Higher Higher. Lower. Up Lower Perfect.  Whoa!
Princess Bubblegum| Hey!
King of Ooo| Ah! What are you doing here, former Princess Bubblegum? Did you forget that you lost the election?
Princess Bubblegum| Monarchies are not democracies!
King of Ooo| What?! Oof! Aah!
Banana Guard & Crunchy| Ooh
King of Ooo| Hey! Banana Guards, seize her!
Banana Guard| Uh, princess, should we listen to him?
Princess Bubblegum| No, just keep him out of my way! And untie Crunchy!
Crunchy| Thank you, Your Princessness!
Jake| Man, we've been doing this for hours.
Finn| You know, it's weird that P.B. wanted us to stake her back, instead of us taking her back.
Jake|" Wait. ""Taking"" or ""staking""? She said ""you guys, 'sztake' her back."
Finn|" "" No, yeah! She said, ""you guys, take her back."
Jake|" "" So which one should we do?"
Finn| Both, I guess. We'd better hurry before she wakes up at sundown.
Jake| Whoops. Get her back in the vase!
Finn| Come get us, blood bucket!
Jake| What?!
Finn| Run!
Finn| Here she come!
Jake| Dude, for real, why'd you make her chase us?
Finn|" Marci needs her healing powers. ""Stake her back"" to the castle, bro!"
Jake| Shoot, just don't let her near my deli tray!
Finn| Well, run harder, dude!
Jake| Okay.
Finn| Man, she is really booking it hard! You see that, Jake?
Jake| No, bro, just let me run!
Finn| Holy stink! She's smiling right at me!
Jake| I don't need a play-by-play, man!
Finn| She's messing with us.
Jake| What do you mean?!
Finn| I mean she's not catching up on purpose!
Jake| Why do you think that?
Finn| She's giving me this look Slow down so I can talk to her.
Jake| No, boy, you crazy!
Finn| Just do it! I won't let her bite you!
Jake| Okay, my life is in your hands, man!
Finn| Hey. We're leading you to a trap. We're gonna suck out your healing power and dust you. And then I'm gonna put your dust in a litter box. And get a tiger to drop a huge smelly tiger bomb on your sorry dust clumps!
Jake| Stop hitting my butt!
Moon| You run in the path of my light.
Jake| That's her voice?!
Moon| How can you lead me when I am your guide?
Finn| Are you being literal or allegorical?  Me no like! Run, Jake, run!
Jake| But she said I'm running in her light!
Finn| Who gives a donk?! Just go!
Princess Bubblegum| All right, where's your measuring equipment? I need to see some charts! And tubes Where are your tubes?
Peppermint Butler| This process uses no tubes and involves no quantifiable measurements. Calm your mind and let the crystal medium work its magi Its science.
Princess Bubblegum| All right, Pep. I just wish I could do more for her. 
Princess Bubblegum| There, there. We're all worried about Marceline.
Banana Guard| That's not really why I'm crying. Princess, we really miss you! 
Princess Bubblegum| Come on, guys, it's all right.  Oh!
Peppermint Butler| Shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Okay, finished.
Princess Bubblegum|" That's it? You just go, ""shu, shu, shu"" with your hands?"
Peppermint Butler| Don't question my methods! This is my world.
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, what now, then?
Peppermint Butler| We wait, like, two hours.
Princess Bubblegum| Oh.
Peppermint Butler| Let's do something else.
Princess Bubblegum| Like what?
Peppermint Butler| Mm, video games?
Princess Bubblegum| I don't like video games.
Peppermint Butler| Me neither. I don't even have a system to play on or anything.
Banana Guard 1| I got a video game back at my place. But I just got it so I could stay in shape.
Banana Guard 2| How do you get in shape playing a game?
Banana Guard 2| Uh It's like a yoga video.
Banana Guard 1| So it's not a game at all.
Banana Guard 2| No, it is. It's a video game.
Banana Guard 1| Uh, it's a video.
Banana Guard 2| Yes.
Banana Guard 1| A yoga video.
Banana Guard 2| Game. A game.
Banana Guard 1| Video.
Princess Bubblegum| You guys.
Finn| We brought The Moon!
Jake| What do we do?
Moon| Die like pigs!
Princess Bubblegum| Hold her off till Marci wakes up!
Finn| She's not doing anything.
Jake| You gonna try something?
Finn| Okay, I guess. Whoops!
Jake| What was that?!
Finn| I don't know, man, I think I just got tapped out!
Jake|" ""Tap out""? When do you ever tap out?"
Moon| Pigs!
Finn| She's doing something weird! Jake, help!
Jake| I can't! I feel like I'm in a slow-motion terror dream!
Finn| Banana Guards, help!
Finn| Princess, I can't stop her!
Princess Bubblegum| You kind of have to, Finn!
Finn| Rats! Okay, let me get my sword.
Moon| Marceline.
Princess Bubblegum| It's locked, dipstick!
Moon| Open, pig! Open, pig! Pigs!
Princess Bubblegum| Come on, Marci, wake up! Wake up!
Marceline| It's spring again And the yard is full Of tiny flowers You used to call them weeds And you killed them al
Princess Bubblegum| But they were growing too tall
Marceline| What?! I can't hear you!
Princess Bubblegum|" I said, ""Wake up, Marceline."""
Marceline| ....
Princess Bubblegum|  I said Wake up. Huh?
Moon| Pigs! Pigs!
Marceline| You!
Princess Bubblegum| Marceline!
Moon| Pigs, pigs!
Princess Bubblegum|" Did you just yell ""pigs"" at the lock until it opened?"
Princess Bubblegum & Marceline| Oh!
Peppermint Butler| In your face!
Princess Bubblegum| Marci, now!
Jake| Finn.
Finn| Yes!
Jake| Finn, she's dead.
Finn| Oh, thank glob.
Finn| JAKE, WAKE UP! I FOUND A TRUCK!
Jake|  What?
BMO| What's happening?
Jake| Whoa!  Where did ya get this baby? 
Finn|" I found it in the woods. I named it ""Hot Daniel."" Anyway, I figured we could do some pretty sick stuff with it."
Jake| Oh, yeah? Like what?
Finn| Hmm. I don't know. Launch it off some ramps, maybe get it going thirty miles per hour, crank the wheel into a gnar right-hander, spray dirt everywhere like a big hurkin' dirt wave?
Jake| Yeah, buddy!  Nice! Let's crank this beast up.
Finn| Can't—engine's busted, I think.
Jake| Nuts. BMO, you know anything about cars?
BMO| Nope.
Finn| Hmm. Maybe...  Ice King, you know anything about cars?
Ice King| Nope. Not a car guy—too confusing. Got better things to do with my life.
Finn| Hmm.
Jake| Wait... I know someone who's good with mechanics.
Banana Man| Hey! Hey, guys! Hi!
Jake| Hey, Banana Man.
Banana Man| Wow! I haven't seen you fellas since you destroyed my home, my land, and my rocket.
Finn| Aw, jeez, yeah. Sorry, Banana Man—just sorta happened.
Banana Man| Don't worry about it! Feh! Bygones! I'm just excited you called me over. We're neighbors. We should help each other out. I got the soda and the jams.
Finn, Jake, & BMO| Cool!
Banana Man|  I see the problem. The top of your engine is gone, specifically, the cylinder head.
Finn| Hm. Okay. That word sounds cool... but what does it mean?
Banana Man| Let me explain.  The cylinder head is the top to the cylinder block.  Think of the cylinder head as an airtight lid to your engine that regulates air, fuel, and exhaust.
Finn| Okay. Cool. Informative.  What is he pointing at?
Banana Man| Now this lid is important because it works to get fuel into your engine.  You see, your engine has cylinders, and these cylinders are pistons. When the piston in the cylinder moves down, it creates a vacuum, pulling in fuel from the intake.
BMO| You mean an air-fuel mixture?
Banana Man| That's right, BMO.  Have a gold star, dear.
BMO| Yay! BMO is so pretty and smart!
Banana Man| Then the piston returns to the top, compressing the air-fuel mixture. Then a spark plug fires off, creating an explosion, driving the piston back down, powering the engine. 
Finn| Sweet. So where's the cylinder head, then?
Banana Man| Hmm. Well, sometimes people store parts they're working on in the car.  Ah! Bingo!  Found it.
Finn| Yeah! Drive time!
Banana Man| Well... n-not quite. We don't know why they took the cylinder head off. Uh, it could be cracked, the gasket head could be warped, the rod bearings could have damage from water—you see, that's the cool thing about cars.  One tiny little thing messes everything else up so nothing works! So it's up to us to figure it out!
Finn| Cool.
Jake| Yeah, alright.
Jake| Whoo. I'm bushed. You guys wanna pick this up again in the mornin'?
Finn| Sure.
Banana Man| Sounds good!
BMO| Not BMO. This grease monkey's torqued up on automotive styles.  Yeah,  boyee!
Finn| Okay, BMO. Good night, Banana Man.
Banana Man| Have a good evening, gents.
BMO| Time for the night shift. 
Starchie| It's ten past the hour, and this is Graveyard Shift, hosted by me, Starchie the Gravedigger, your weekly five-hour dose of all the strange haints, phantasmagoria, and phenomena I see working in the Candy Kingdom Graveyard. Hello, caller. You're on the Graveyard Shift.
Banana Guard| What? Am I—oh, hi! Um, longtime listener, first-time caller. So, uh, I think Princess Bubblegum has been replaced by, like, a lizard person.
BMO| A lizard? 
Banana Guard| Yeah, a lizard. I love your show.
Starchie| Oh, Starchie is very interested in this topic. What led you to this discovery, caller?
BMO|  They are wrong! You look more like a hippo than a lizard.
Banana Guard| Well, um, my friend is a very highly-placed official in the Candy Kingdom, and I've noticed—
Banana Man| Hi, BMO.
BMO|  Stay back, lizard!
Banana Man| Sorry, BMO. I-I didn't mean to startle you. I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about the truck... and biodiesel! Oh, and I figured out what's wrong with the engine block. So what are you working on?
BMO| Aerodynamics.
Banana Man| Swe-e-e-et! You know, it's been really nice hanging with you fellas and working on the car.  It gets a little lonely at my space-age banana dome.
BMO| You don't have a girlfriend?
Banana Man| No. I-I don't want to be alone, but... I've gotten pretty good at it. I putter around the house, keeping busy with my little projects. But it would be nice to find someone.
Starchie| Hold up. Princess? Is that you?  Ah, spooky.
Finn| Yo, BMO. Coffee.
BMO| Thank you. 
Finn| Car looks nice, BMO.
Jake| Yeah.
Banana Man|   Uh! Ah! I fixed it! Are we best friends yet?! Oh. Oh, hey. I-I fixed it.
Finn|  N-i-i-i-i-i-ice.
Banana Man| I discovered the cylinder head was warped so I went to the junkyard and got a new one.  Bingo.
Finn| Whoo.
Jake| Biodiesel.
Finn, Jake, BMO, and Banana Man| Yeah!
Finn| Awesome!
Banana Man|   Yow-ee-wow.  She's beautiful.
Jake| Well, then go over and talk to her.
BMO| Yeah, come on, Banana Man! You're lonely!
Banana Man| Oh, no, that's okay. Having someone to love takes up time I could use to work on stuff.
Jake| That's the craziest thing I ever heard.  Pardon me, miss. My friend here is super smart, and he rebuilt this truck.
BMO| He's very smart and very single!
Female Banana Guard|  Okay...
Jake| Anyway, his name is Banana Man. If you like what you see, give him a call.
Princess Bubblegum| He-e-e-elp m-e-e-e-e-e-e!
Finn| We gotta save Bubblegum!
BMO| No, Finn! She's a lizard!
Jake| You gotta stop listening to all those conspiracy shows.  They twist up your noodle so you can't tell what's real.
Finn| Look, there she is!
Jake|  You want some tea?
Princess Bubblegum|  Sure!
Princess Bubblegum| Thanks, Jake.
Finn| So, what's up with the angry mob, PB?
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, they think I've been replaced with an evil lizard replicant. It's sheer nonsense.
BMO|  Eat this bug!
Lizard|  
Finn|  Punch it, 'Nana Man!
Princess Bubblegum|  What the fridge?
Princess Bubblegum| Finn, Jake! Reptilian synthoid replicants are trying to take over the kingdom!
Finn| Yeah. We know.
BMO| Kill it!
Princess Bubblegum| No, no! I'm the real one!
BMO|  Hmm...
Female Banana Guard| Hey, speedy.  You're comin' with me.
Banana Man| What? Really?
Female Banana Guard| Mm-hmm... 'cause you ain't got enough peel on that 'nanner! You're under arrest for public indecency!
Jake| Bye, Banana Man!
BMO|  It's not fair!
Princess Bubblegum| It's okay, BMO. It's a very mild offense.
BMO| It's not like that! Hot Daniel is dead!
Jake| Heck yeah! We’re home.
Finn| That was definitely the longest adventure we’ve ever done.
Jake| What about when you got trapped in a mind dungeon for a buncha years?
Finn| This trip was longer in emotional time.
Jake| Yeah, I’m burnt out. No more adventure for a while, okay?
Jake| Yes, yes, yes!
Jake| Let’s go take hot showers!
Finn| Hey, look at this fish.
Finn| It’s… gummy?
Fish| Hello!
Finn| Hey!
Finn| Well, that’s weird. We should defs check it out after we hit up the tree house.
Jake| Yeah. We gotta get to the bottom of this hot shower.
Finn| Hmm. Does everything seem pinker to you?
Jake| Home always looks different after a long trip. You’re seeing it with fresh eyes and newfound wisdom. And sometimes there’s also a new strip mall or something. So, everything being pink is probably not a big deal, and also, I’m tired.
BMO| I like the pink. Why you worry so much, worry baby?
Jake| Haha, yeah, why you worry so much, worry baby?
BMO| Don’t worry, Finn. We are only teasing you because you are a baby.
Jake| Woah!
Jake| What the heck happened to the tree house?
Finn| Candy… Fern?
Finn| Oh, I do not like this.
BMO| Is this some kind of sick joke? Because I love it.
Finn| Huh? Big Baby Root Beer? No one buys this brand. It’s too sweet.
Fern| Hello?
Finn| Ah!
Fern| Hey! You look like me.
Finn| Fern?
Fern| Who’s Fern? I’m Fun the human!
Neptr| And I’m Nectr, the little robot!
Shelby| And I’m Shelby the worm… the gummy worm!
Fern| Welcome, strangers! It’s so cool that you’re inside our house.
Finn| Dude, when did you guys turn into candy?
Shelby| We’ve always been candy, you silly billy bean!
Jake|  Oh, okay, I get it.
Jake| We’ve obviously stumbled into another alternate dimension where everyone’s a different version of themselves. Yawn.
BMO| But we haven’t gone through any portals. BMO would know.
Neptr| Hello!
BMO| Neptr is so cute now! I’m going to start treating him as an equal.
Finn| You were supposed to take care of Ooo while I was gone. What happened with that?
Fern| What?
Finn| You used to be this volatile plant boy, remember?
Fern| Really? Well, I’m candy now. And, I’m in control of my emotions.
Shelby| I’m in control, too. Of my body!
Jake| Wow, gummy Shelby’s a lot of fun. I think I’m okay with candy world.
Finn| No way. Let’s talk to P.B. I’m sure this is all one of her experiments gone wrong.
Neptr| You seem upset, friend. The tower will fix you right up.
Finn| The what, now?
Fern| Oh, boy! Let’s run outside!
Lemongrab| Hello, it’s me!
Fern| Lemonpink!
Fern| He was inside the lemon.
Lemongrab| Drink up, babies! Squeeze!
Lemongrab| I used to have a lot of fear and sadness, but now I’m fine!
Jake| Hey, I want some of that!
Finn| No. That is body juice.
Lemongrab| Hmm? What’s that? Did you spurn my fluids?
Finn| No…?
Lemongrab| Maybe someone’s feeling a little sour!
Fern| Wuh-woah!
Neptr| You know what sours get!
Shelby| Sours get the tower!
Fern, Neptr, Shelby, and Lemongrab| Sours get the tower! Sours get the tower!
Fern, Neptr, Shelby, and Lemongrab| Sours get the tower! Sours get the tower!
Finn| Come on, Jake. Let’s go see Bubblegum.
Jake| Stop striding! It just keeps you agitated.
Finn| I’m freaking out, Jake. This place is weird.
Jake| What I’m hearing is, you’re stressed out because everything’s candy.
Finn| Aren’t you?
Jake| Not really.
Jake| Lemongrab’s always been a weirdo. At least now he’s helping people.
Jake| And Fern is, like, laughing and joking around. Maybe they don’t need you to fix them.
Finn| Hmm.
Finn| I always believe you when you use that voice.
Finn| Sweet P.?
Finn| Hey, buddy. What are you doing out-
Finn| -Hey! You’re meat!
Sweet P.| Yes, I’m meat. But everything else is weird.
Finn| Wow, Sweet P., that’s almost exactly what I’ve been saying.
Jake| Sweet P., do you remember what happened?
Sweet P.| One day, the candy came and turned mommy and daddy into something… different.
Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig| Sweet P.!
Mr. Pig| We’ve been looking for you everywhere!
Mr. Pig| We just love you so much, son. You’re gonna get into a great college!
BMO| They look so happy, like dogs.
Finn| Don’t worry, Sweet P. We’re headed to the candy kingdom to see Princess Bubblegum about all this.
Sweet P.| She’s not in the candy kingdom. She’s in the terrible tower. Look!
Finn| Come on, Jake, that’s kind of weird, right?
BMO| I think it’s magnificent!
Tree Trunks| Sweet P.! Yoo hoo!
Tree Trunks| We brought some rollers and a bucket of sweet juicy caramel.
Tree Trunks| Let’s get you back to normal.
Sweet P.| But mama, I am normal!
Tree Trunks| Just sit tight there like a windowpane, and you’ll be back to normal like a windowpane.
Tree Trunks| Back to normal.
Jake| Hmm. Okay, you’re right. This is pretty freaky-deaky.
Sweet P.| I’m gonna go now.
Finn and Jake| Sweet P., come back!
Finn| Uh… Let’s get to the tower.
Jake| And never be the guy with no phone, Finn. You’ll think it’ll make people wanna talk to you more, but people just forget to invite you to things.
Finn| You’ve convinced me. Plus, I like late night bedtime calls when you’re sleeping over at Lady’s.
Jake| Ooh. Something smells nice. Nice and toasty.
Finn, Jake, and BMO| S’more!
Finn| Stay back, s’more!
Jake| Get it, get it, get it, get it!
Marceline| Woah, dudes.
Marceline| I was just playin’.
Finn, Jake, and BMO| What? Marceline?
Marceline| No, it’s Marshmaline, the Campfire Queen.
Marceline| Would you like to hear a song? I’ve written just the ditty that’ll cheer up anyone that’s overwhelmed with work or responsibility.
BMO| Yay! I love Marshmaline songs!
Finn| No time for tunes. Do you know where Bonnie is?
Marceline| Of course! Follow me.
Finn| Marshy… Where’s P.B.?
Marceline| She’s everywhere!
Princess Bubblegum| Good tidings to you, my friends.
BMO| Yahoo!
Finn| What… What happened to you?
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, this?
Princess Bubblegum| I’ve become what I was always meant to become A pure candy elemental.
Princess Bubblegum| ‘Scuse me.
Finn| What about Tree Trunks, and Lemongrab, and Marceline, and everyone else?
Princess Bubblegum| I fixed ‘em, obviously.
Finn| “Fixed ‘em?” But they’re your friends!
Princess Bubblegum| Those aren’t mutually exclusive concepts.
Marceline| That means it’s fine.
Finn| No. It’s not fine!
Princess Bubblegum| Don’t fret. I can fix you too.
Finn| I can feel my bones turning gummy!
BMO| Me, too!
Jake| We gotta get out of here before-
Marceline| Hugs!
Princess Bubblegum| I’m connected to all candy throughout all the galaxies. Once you’re candy, you’ll be part of me too!
Finn| No! That plan sucks.
Finn| Oh, my gosh!
Finn| Ah! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!
Finn| I’m sorry! I’m sorry! I’m sorry!
Ice King| Skyhooks!
Finn| Ice King?
Finn| Hold on to me, bro!
Princess Bubblegum| No!
Finn| Wait, we forgot BMO!
BMO| Goodbye, boys! It’s better this way!
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, well. They’ll be back.
Princess Bubblegum| They have nowhere else to go.
Finn| Are we in…
Jake| Cloud Kingdom.
Finn| Looks like we got away before the candy curse became permanent.
Ice King| That’s right. My skyhooks saved the day.
Finn| Thanks for getting us out of there, Simon.
Ice King| Aw, I can’t take all the credit. It’s all thanks to my skyhooks!
Finn| Hey, why are you even up here?
Ice King| We live here, now. Me and the skyhooks.
Jake| Finn...You gotta see this.
Finn| Oh...my...
Finn| ...butt.
Ice King| Skyhooks!
Kenneth| Uhh, hello? Hi. Uh, is this the secret mee—
Candy Person| What errand? What haste?
Kenneth|" Uh. Oh, shoot. Oh! ""To beelzebub with the brewer's knave!"" "
Starchie| Ahh, Kenneth.
Kenneth| Hey, Starchie.
Starchie| Glad you could make it. I officially call this meeting of the veritas brigade to order.  Lux in tenebris.
Kenneth, Banana Guard, Nurse Pound Cake & Science| Lux in tenebris.
Starchie|  So, anybody have weird stuff to report?
Nurse Pound Cake| Well, sometimes at night, I see a shadowy figure around Princess Bubblegum's tower. I have a feeling it might be otherworldly!
Starchie| Whoa, this is some good stuff. We are this close to finally exposing the princess' shady dealings.  Meanwhile, PB remains blissfully unaware up in her ivory tower. 
Kenneth| Excuse me. I believe I've made a startling discovery of my own.  I've developed this high-tech device. It broadcasts waves that—theoretically—disrupt parallel dimensions!
Starchie| Whoa, Kenny boy, you're blowing my mind. 
Peace Master| So...a tinkerer, eh? Fiddling at the fringes of unknown realms. Tell me, Kenneth, will you be ready when the flames of those evil places consume everything you hold dear?!  I thought not!
Starchie| Hey, Peace Master.  Ohh!  Oh! My noodle.
Peace Master| There is something very wrong dwelling in the Candy Kingdom...a dark entity I plan to purge from the face of Ooo.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh! Uh oh!
Peace Master| Its presence has infected every home, every place of business, even here in this very room.  Yes, this foul creature watches us even.. Now!  I know you can hear me. Tonight your reign ends.  'Cause I am totally gonna vanquish you! 
Princess Bubblegum| Whoa! Holy flippin' flap! Red alert!  Pep But, start brewing up some chamomile tea so I don't stress out! 
Peace Master|  Sorry, I hate evil so much.
Starchie| It's all cool, Peace Master. Truth sleuths keep it real.
Peace Master| Yes. As lone scouts, we may fall, but together we will stand as a mighty force!  Oh, dang. I gotta go.  But I shall return in one hour! 
Starchie| Alright, Peace Master. We'll be ready.  Mm. Dill-icious!
Peace Master|  Dun-de-dun-dun-dun, Peace Master! Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
Peace Master's Daughter| Finally.
Peace Master| Uh, sorry about the wait, guys. Daddy was pontificating.
Peace Master's Daughter|  Hey, Dad, can we go to the Sorcery and Dark Arts fair tomorrow?
Peace Master| No, honey, that stuff is highly inappropriate for kids. Daddy works very hard to protect you guys from that kind of stuff. If you only knew of the monstrosities that lurk around every corner.
Peace Master's Son|  Dark Arts!
Peace Master|  Stop laughing! You're stressing daddy out!  See?! See what happens when you mess with the dark arts?  I'll get you, dark one! You wrecked Peace Master's minivan! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Yo! Red alert!  Right, guys? What'cha doin' about it?!
Colonel Candy Corn| Whoa, be careful about old man naptime, please. That could have been it for me just now.
Princess Bubblegum| What is going on here? 
Banana Guard| Don't.  No!  Hey, watch your pieces, man.
Princess Bubblegum|  I thought you were gonna whip these guys into shape, Colonel.
Colonel Candy Corn| PB, you can't teach a butterfly to bark. You know what I'm saying?  Well, they like my stories. They're good listeners. It ain't like them old days with those hard-nosed Rattleball boys.  Say, what happened to them Rattleball boys?
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, you guys. Keep up the good work. 
Finn|  What was your count?
Jake| Uh, 3 minutes. What about you?
Finn| Uh, 3 minutes, 30 seconds.
Jake| What's that? Your invisible watch?
Finn| No, I was just pointing at my wrist.
Rattleballs|  57 seconds.
Jake| Oh, dang, we were both counting fast.
Finn| Hey, Rattleballs, are you sure you're waterproof?
Rattleballs| No.
Jake| Do you even need to breathe, Rattleballs?
Rattleballs| Continue training. 3, 2, 1...
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey, Peps, where's the tea?!
Peppermint Butler|  Uh, just a second.
Princess Bubblegum|" Just leave it out for me. I'm gonna go find Finn or Rattleballs or somebody to run down this Peace Master bozo.  ""Take my time""? Alright."
Peppermint Butler| Ooh-wah, oooh-wah. My light will move in darkness. I go unseen by low level biddies.  Whah-ha!  Yes! Light of the hermit, reveal my nemesis, and in the folds of Horus, carry me in haste! Fold, I say!  Yaaaah!
Peace Master|  You going stinkhouse, baby? Ooh.  Whomp! Almost got me, but my lucky talisman sensed your presence.
Peppermint Butler|  Haha! 
Peace Master|  Look here, friends. The beast lies exposed!
Starchie|  Oh, this is a mistake. That's my boy, Peppermint Butler.
Peace Master| His powers of darkness made me go crazy and crash my minivan earlier!
Peppermint Butler| You need to chill, Peace Master. I'm just a harmless, old butler. 
Peace Master| Mm?  Ha ha!  In you go! You see this?! My dark wizard gobbler poots evil souls into the void.
Starchie| You can't do that to our friend!
Peace Master| Oh. I see how it is. Maybe y'all should get in here, too.  Digest! 
Kenneth|  Dimension disruptor, come on! Please, please, please, please!  Yes!
Peace Master|  Impossible!
Peppermint Butler|  Time-out.
Peace Master| You can't time-ou—
Peppermint Butler|  Whazaa! Whoop! 
Peace Master| No! Your dirty hobo birthday tricks won't save you long time! You hear?! You still here?
Peppermint Butler|  Uh, no? I-I don't know. No.
Peace Master| Then hear my challenge! On the field of wizard battles, armed in my talismans of light, I will destroy you and free my children from the spell you cast over their minds!
Peppermint Butler|  I accept!
Peace Master| See you tomorrow, butler. 
Peppermint Butler| See you tomorrow, momo.
Peace Master|  Tomorrow!  Peppermint Burfer, show yourself!
Peppermint Butler|  Yeah, yeah, I'm here...momo.
Peace Master| You're the momo. Your spells are no match for my righteous charm sack. 
Peace Master's Son| Dark arts!
Peace Master| My kids!
Peppermint Butler| You like hunting monsters, do you?  Lords of the Nightosphere, he must pay a penalty.  Transfigure this babe into a super-weirdie! 
Peace Master's Son| Ha!
Peace Master| Noooo!
Peppermint Butler| Bam!  Now you got a monster kid.
Peace Master| Son!
Peace Master's Son|  Look, Pappy! Dark magic!
Peppermint Butler| Remember, you still got two non-monster kids. And if you want to keep them that way, you better toss all your charms down the hole!
Peace Master|  I will smite thee.
Peppermint Butler| A'ight. 
Peace Master's Daughter| Whoa, sweet!
Peace Master| Nooo!  Alright, alright. Okay, you win. 
Peppermint Butler| One more thing. Show us your underwear.
Peace Master| You fiend. 
Peppermint Butler| Now, um, uh, walk around like a big chicken.
Peppermint Butler|  Now eat some dirt off the ground.
Peace Master|  Please don't make me.
Peppermint Butler| 'Ey! You want three demon babies?!
Peppermint Butler| Okay, stop. I took it too far.  We're done here. R-Run along, children. 
Peace Master's Son| Dada, can I go to the park and eat flies?
Peace Master|  Yes? 
Colonel Candy Corn|  Princess, I think I got something on camera 206!  Just look at that sicko.
Princess Bubblegum|  Where's Peace Master?! Gah, I am freaking out here!
Peppermint Butler|  Princess, your chamomile tea.
Princess Bubblegum| Whff! Thanks. 
Colonel Candy Corn|  Well, how do I check my e-mails on this?
Finn| Hey, Kim Kil Whan. We solved the mystery of the haunted office. It was Clockbear the whole time... Yeah, uh, Jake's around here somewhere.
Jake| Man, it's crazy to think I was born here. In this alley. Popped right out of my dad's head for some reason.  Yaah! You scared me there, what with the appearing out of thin air and staring at me all creepy and now you're just reaching towards me.
Warren Ampersand|  Let's go, son. 
Jake| Son? I ain't nobody's son but Joshua and Margaret! Though it is weird that you got exactly the same stretchy power as me.
Warren Ampersand|  It's not weird. It's fate! We have to leave, like -  right now!
Jake| Wait, can Finn come with us? We're kind of a package deal.
Warren Ampersand| Oh, that's kind of a bad idea. Our home world's atmosphere is, uh, poisonous to his kind.
Jake| Well then I'd better write him a note. 
Warren Ampersand| Destiny calls!
Jake| Whoa!
Finn|  Jake?
Jake| Who are you, anyway?
Warren Ampersand| My name is Warren Ampersand. I'm your alien bio-dad! Heh-heh. 
Jake| Why do you keep laughing?
Warren Ampersand|  I'm nervous.
Warren Ampersand|  Welcome to your home planet - Nerraw.
Jake| Great fantasy sci-fi vibe, man. And that black hole really adds an extra dimension to the place.
Warren Ampersand| Years ago, I left this beautiful planet and traveled to Ooo to implant my destiny-rich, stretchy DNA into a compatible host.
Jake| That explains a lot, actually.
Warren Ampersand| But now I'm dying.
Jake| What?
Warren Ampersand| I used the last of my strength  to bring you home.
Alien|  He's here!
Jake| Huh?
Aliens|  Is that Jake? It's really him! Did you see him? Look over there. Look. That's Jake!
Jake| Warren, how does everyone know me?
Warren Ampersand| Because you're the most important person to have ever lived. Behold! The Jakeseum!
Jake| A museum? All about me?!
Aliens|  It's Jake! Jake! Jake! It's Jake!
Alien 1| Will you sign my prophecy book?
Alien 2| Will you sign my pretzel?
Jake| This is wild. But it feels so right, you know?  Hey! It's my fifth birthday party. And my graduation. And when I put a snail in my mouth. And when a snail put me in its mouth. And...  No. I don't remember this one.
Warren Ampersand|  That's an artist's interpretation of the great prophecy. Tomorrow, you are prophesied to battle Ixcano, a monster with tentacles stretching across the galaxy to strangle everything. You alone can banish him to the darkness.
Warren Ampersand| I've researched your world and created the ideal child room. See?  Space stuff, dinosaurs, and cowboys.
Jake| Cool. But you know it's a little late to try connecting with me, right?  Is that clown cake for me? 
Warren Ampersand|  I got you something else, too. 
Warren Ampersand| What do you think of your old dad's present?
Jake|  I love it! Still never gonna call you dad, though.
Warren Ampersand| Oh, I wouldn't dream of asking. But I hope you don't mind if I still wear this. 
Aliens|  Good luck, Jake! Savior us!
Warren Ampersand|  This is the Sacred Temple of Pannishment. The temple door can only be unlocked by a stretchy dog.
Jake| With key ha-a-a-a-a...  Uh...
Warren Ampersand| Beyond this door, there lies an ancient, awesome weapon called the Panzark.
Jake| I am so ready for this. This must be why I can stretch.
Warren Ampersand| Yeah, that totally tracks.
Jake| Hup!
Jake|  This is so complicated and rewarding.
Warren Ampersand| You're doing great, son!
Jake| Almost there. 
Aliens|  Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!
Warren Ampersand| The Panzark!
Jake|  Yay!
Jake|  Saving the galaxy's exhausting. I'm dying... for a soft pretzel with mustard. 
Jake|"  ""Pri-tzels""! Oh. ""Pri-vate""."
Warren Ampersand|  Hello, there, you handsome young devil. Have we met?  Oh wait, it's just me! I didn't recognize this smooth, young skin or these vigorous kneecaps.
Jake| Oof!
Warren Ampersand|  It's another clown cake, with a side of cocktail hot dogs.
Jake| Dude, weren't you, like, dying?
Warren Ampersand|  Shush, son!  Ixcano approacheth!
Jake| Oh, dang.
Warren Ampersand| I'll go grab the Panzark.
Jake| So how do I-
Warren Ampersand| You just gotta stretch through the convolutions of the Panzark to activate its kill beam.
Jake| More stretching, huh?  Here comes the hero.
Warren Ampersand| Stretch, baby! Stretch!
Warren Ampersand| You're doing it, son!
Jake| Ugh. This is too much.
Warren Ampersand| Jake!
Aliens| Jake! Jake! Ja-
Jake| What's going on? Where's that Ixcano jerk?
Warren Ampersand| I have a confession. There is no Ixcano. I made it all up.
Jake| So... you're not really dying?
Warren Ampersand| No, I was dying. I needed to siphon your precious stretchy essence to keep me young and virile. I use these belts as a conduit. The more you stretch, the stronger I grow! I've done it hundreds of times, to hundreds of sons.  But I never felt guilty before. Maybe it's because you're so much cooler than my other kids.
Jake| Well, I am cool.
Warren Ampersand| Or maybe it's this feeling your kind calls... low-key affection? I- I low-key affection you, son. 
Jake| I'm sorry, Dad.  I wasn't powerful enough to destroy Ixcano! 
Warren Ampersand| What? No. It was just me stretching the whole time. The Panzark. The people.
Jake| You're just saying that to make me feel better.
Warren Ampersand|" I'll prove it.  ""I'm Finn! I like pizza and dangerous girls."" And here's Joshua!  ""I'm no Warren Ampersand, but I guess I raised you."""
Jake|  Do more!
Warren Ampersand|"  ""I'm Lady! Neigh."" Oh, I know. You like parties!  Here's a bunch of party bears!"
Jake|  Make more party bears! And make the tree house! Put party bears on the tree house! Put party bears in the sky!
Warren Ampersand|  Okay.
Jake| Keep stretching, you old phoney. It only makes me stronger! 
Warren Ampersand| Belt switch! But how?!
Jake| Old-fashioned grifting, ya rube!
Jake| My real dad taught me that trick.
Warren Ampersand| But I was a proud pop!
Jake| I'm the proud pop of a whole bunch of pups. The belt totally applies to me as well.  See?
Warren Ampersand| Five stretchy pups.
Jake| Whuh-oh.
Warren Ampersand| You saved me after all!  Out of juice. I need those pups!
Jake| Don't even think about it!
Warren Ampersand| Can't wait to meet my grandkids and drain their essence. 
Jake| Aw, nah!  Leave my kids alone! 
Warren Ampersand| If you destroy me, you'll be stuck on that rock forever!
Jake| My pups are worth it! 
Warren Ampersand| Not the singularity! I just wanted to live forever!  I see now. This fleshy form has taken me as far as it can. I'm going 4-D, baby. 
Jake| Bye, Warren Ampersand. Thanks for reminding me what it means to be a good dad  by being the worst dad ever. Never even got a pretzel.
Peppermint Butler|  Ogdoad, master of Level 8 shadow world, the winning vessel issues forth its pure essence.
Cinnamon Bun|  Aha aha aha...
Peppermint Butler|  You must overtake the vessel as night overtakes the day. By your very nature, you cannot deny my will.
Ogdoad| Hello, what jazz is this?  Peppermint Butler! That's the last straw! I will fill you with the shadow of a thousand brown portals!
Peppermint Butler| Oh, no, Ogdoad! You are mine!
Gumball Guardian| Peanut Butler, bleh, Peppermint Butler, cease these dark magic activities .
Ogdoad| Hey! Let me go first! I got stuff to do today!
Peppermint Butler|   What'd ya do that for?!
Gumball Guardian| You neglect your duties to the princess. She has been in her lab for nine weeks. She needs to get out, socialize. Look,  her suitors, her faithful suitors, waiting for a chance to share her burdens.
Peppermint Butler| No, man! She won't date those old bags.
Gumball Guardian| You must try.  The Candy Kingdom worries for its leader, and it worries for you, dark one.
Peppermint Butler|  Alright, you guys. All you guys are gross. How long have you been waiting to court the princess?
Suitor #1|  87 years.
Suitor #2|  120 years!
Suitor #3|  I'm Gerald.
Peppermint Butler| Geez! How long have you been here, Krusty? 
Krusty|  Three hundred years, so what? It's not too late, right, boys?
All the suitors|  It's not too late! Take me on a date! It's my right! Princess all night—
Peppermint Butler| Shush!  What's your deal?
Braco| I'm Braco, and I was born to court the Princess Bubblegum.
Peppermint Butler| How old are you?]
Braco| 21 years. I inherited my father's place in line after his ascension.
Braco's father|  Hey.
Peppermint Butler| And you want to court the princess?
Braco| Yes,  my heart instructs me so.
Peppermint Butler| Alright, buddy, I'm giving you a shot.
Peppermint Butler| But it won't be easy.
Braco| I was born for this. Love will win on this day.
Peppermint Butler|  Sounds good, man.
Peppermint Butler| Prubs!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey, what?  Who's that?
Peppermint Butler| This is Braco.
Braco|  Son of Loghan, who was begat by Hobus.
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, yeah?
Braco| I want to take you... on a date.
Princess Bubblegum|  Thank you, Braco. That's very sweet, but no.
Peppermint Butler| Princess this lab reeks like brown mist; it's unhealthy. You've got to get outside and do some research on boys .
Princess Bubblegum| That is way out of line, Peps, and you guys are donking up my research!  Hello! Donk, donk!
Braco| Princess, I love you! I-I love you so much it hurts.  The pain it—Huh?
Princess Bubblegum|"  Hmmm, what you're feeling is called ""infatuation."" The pain is the product of you overvaluing a projected, imaginary relationship with me."
Braco| No, Princess! What I feel is real! Meet me in the garden tonight  and unlock the mystery  of meee!
Princess Bubblegum| Braco!
Braco|  Come to me tonight.
Princess Bubblegum| Okay Braco, but just for research, alright?
Braco| Yes, Princess.
Peppermint Butler| Good job, man! You take it from here.
Candy Gardener #1| Yo, who's that with PB?
Candy Gardener #2| That's that Braco guy.
Candy Gardener #1| Are they on a date?
Candy Gardener #2| No, brah, the princess don't date.
Braco|  Oh, look,  a miracle of nature like you.
Princess Bubblegum| Now hand it to me...  hmmm.  Okay, I have what I need for now.
Braco| Uh-huh.
The Morrow| Screech!  Screech!
Braco|"  Aww,  N-Nope, no. No tears for Braco! What did she say? ""I have what I need for now."" So she will see me again!  I shall not falter, Papa! ."
Braco|  Dear personal diary, in a consequence of my latest romantic misfortune,  I decided to consult the man who knew best about her majesty,  father's father. Amongst his dearest possessions, he kept a book containing every secret of seduction through superficiality. 
Braco|" The art of ""peacocking."" "
Princess Bubblegum|  Hi, Braco. Nice... hat.
Braco|" I know right.  I am ""peacocking"" you to rally your attention."
Princess Bubblegum| Mhmmmmm .
Braco| Ummm, so what's that on your head?
Princess Bubblegum|  My crown?
Braco|  Oh, uhh—
Princess Bubblegum| .
Braco|  Oww.
Princess Bubblegum| Hmmm .
Braco|  Princess! Ahhh.
Braco| Dear personal diary, I am in terrible pain.  AAAAAAAHH! She is in her castle somewhere, a lonely heart. Do not fear, Princess;  I won't let you down .
Peppermint Butler| Princess, Finn and Jake are here as requested.
Princess Bubblegum| Hey, guys.
Finn| Hey, PB,  what's up?
Princess Bubblegum|  This is a soul stone.  I need one for something I'm working on. Of course, it's really rare, but my scanners found one. It's in the Vapor Swamps.  I printed the map with all the detail.
Finn| PB, who's the new guy?
Princess Bubblegum| What? 
Finn| Hey, man. 
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, that's Braco, a suitor of mine.
Finn| Oh, cool. That's cool—you're dating, that's coool. See ya, Princess.
Finn| What'd ya think of that Braco guy? I mean, he seems kinda weird  and passive and baby lambish  and too unheroic for Peebs.  And then I smashed that peach!
Braco|  Jake and Finn, I seek your aid. I need to ask you for that map, therewith I can bring the soul stone to Bubblegum. Then she'll love me!
Finn| That road you're on leads to nowhere. 
Braco| Oh, oh,  thank you!
Driver|  Huu-ah! This is how far I go.
Driver| Hurry, man, GET OFF! 
Braco| Ah! Oh! Uhhh. 
Giant Insect Monster| Hey, I see you! 
Braco| Oddsbodikins!  AHHHHH!
Braco|  Uhhh. 
Braco|  The soul stone. This journey has come to an end. 
Guardian #1| AHHHHHH! YOU BROKE MY HANDS!
The Beast|   STOP!
The Three Guardians| The Beast! 
Braco|  
The Beast|  RAAAAWR! Why have you stolen my treasure, boy?!
Braco|  For the one I love.
The Beast| Huh. Take the stone.
Princess Bubblegum| Hmmm.
Braco|  Guess who.
Princess Bubblegum|  Braco. Ehhh, what happened to you?
Braco| Oh, look, can it be?  It's a soul stone!
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, yeah, sorry, but I don't need that anymore. I just finished programming a proper simulation of a soul. In fact, this is much easier to manipulate than a real one.  Braco?
Braco| Hmmm,  WHY WON'T SHE LOVE ME?!  Ahhh!
Ogdoad| Set me free, you tranch!
Peppermint Butler| Give me the key to the shadow realm!
Braco| Ahhhh!
Gumball Guardian| You said you were going to handle this. You are doing a bad job.
Peppermint Butler|  Alright, I got this. Peace.  What's up, man? PB is not in to you?
Braco| Yeah, man, I'm throwing the towel.
Peppermint Butler| Whoa, come on. PB's a tough nut, but don't trip out.
Braco| Then you must help me... to crack the nut. 
Peppermint Butler| No problem, man.  We'll use magic, shadow demon magic!
Ogdoad| Say what?
Peppermint Butler| For your freedom, a spell.
Ogdoad| Yes.
Peppermint Butler| Make this man-noodle Braco into a walking love magnet!
Ogdoad|  He he he he, this I can do, but can you pay the price, Braco?
Peppermint Butler| The price is your freedom, man.
Ogdoad| This price lies outside of our arrangement. To receive, you must pay!
Peppermint Butler| Hmmm, alright, well, maybe no dark magic. 
Braco| I'll pay any price... for love!
Ogdoad|  SWAZAA!
Braco| Waaahhh! .
Peppermint Butler| Release!
Cinnamon Bun| Uhhh, who's that? Huh, what?
Braco|  Am I a walking love magnet?
Peppermint Butler| Well, you paid the price, no doubt, and I wanna have your babies.
Braco| To the princess, then! 
Peppermint Butler| No, wait! What about meee?!
Princess Bubblegum| And what's your number-one priority? 
Princess Bubblegum Bot| To find someone to share my life with.
Princess Bubblegum| Awesome, he he he.  You ready to go on some dates?
Princess Bubblegum Bot| Uh, yeah, who should I date?
Princess Bubblegum| There's a guy named Braco who's really nice.
Princess Bubblegum Bot| Ooh, where is he?
Braco| I'm here!
Princess Bubblegum| Braco? What happened to you?!
Braco| I paid the price for love, was it worth it? Do you love me?
Princess Bubblegum| Yes, I love you.
Braco| Then marry me! We'll travel the world, have adventures, make the babes, get fat and weird, and float up to 50th Dead World, right?
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, Braco, I don't want any of that mess. I do love you, but it's the undifferentiated love I feel for all candy citizens. I couldn't permit one of my citizens to suffer the way I saw you suffering over me. And so I made you this. Meet my doppelganger, P-Bot.
Braco| Uhhh, this feels super-wrong.
Princess Bubblegum Bot| Oh, Braco,  let's get out of this smelly lab.
Braco|  Okay!  Thank you, Princess!  Woohoo!
Princess Bubblegum Bot| Woohoo!
Princess Bubblegum| You're welcome, my love .
Peppermint Butler|  Where is he? Where's Braco?!
Princess Bubblegum| I let him go, Peps. I knew he couldn't be happy without me so I built him a robo-wife.
Peppermint Butler| You should have given him to me! 
Finn| Hey, man.
Jake| Oh, hey, Finn!  So you got my map? 
Finn|  Yeah.
Finn| So... how's your experiment going?
Jake| Ah, it's goin' great. I really feel like I fit in,  so to speak. 
Finn| So... are you ready to come home?
Jake| Nah, I think I was just gonna keep being a brick for a while.
Finn| Umm... what are you doing again?
Jake| Finn, ever since I was little, I wanted to see what it's like to be a brick in a brick shack when the brick shack falls down. And this shack is gonna fall down. Just look at it. Like sandcastles in the sun, baby.  You're too young; you wouldn't understand.
Finn|  You're right. I don't understand. But I'm cool with your mystical journey or whatever. I'm gonna leave this walkie-talkie so we can stay in touch. Just in case.
Jake| What? No, man, bricks don't stay in touch!
Finn| Dude, BMO is, like, really worried about you.
Jake| Aww. You tell that little goofball I said hi.
Finn| I will.  Well, I guess I should head back.
Jake| Oh. Really? So soon?
Finn| Yeah, well, it took me, like, half a day to get here. Besides, you're just a brick, right?
Jake|  Yeah.
Finn|  Alright, see ya, Jake!
Jake| Bye! Okay, back to being a brick.  I'm so bored.
Jake|  Ooh, I'm starting to get a little tippy in my teacups.
Jake|  A bunny!
Jake| Looks like our long-eared friend is on to something. Bunnies love to dig. He's making a supreme effort, and I think I can guess why.
Jake| That's right. A carrot, grown out here free and wild, probably the result of a seed pooped out by a passing bird.
Jake| But what's this? A mysterious rustling in the bush. Could mean trouble. Mr. Bunny seems to think so. His sensitive whiskers quiver at the hint of imminent danger.
Jake| Unfortunately for Mr. Bunny, this is what nature is all about. It's a male deer. Not a threat to Mr. Bunny in the predatory sense, but still above him in the food chain. Mr. Bunny, wishing to avoid an encounter, hops away to safety.
Jake| Wow, deers are jerks.
Finn| Hey, man. You know I can hear everything you say, right?
Jake| What?! Arrrrrgh! No! I had no idea.
Finn| Yeah, but you saw me leave the walkie-talkie, and I left it on. You know that, right?
BMO| Hi, Jake!
Jake| Hi, BMO.
Finn| Need anything? A soda?
Jake| No.
Finn| So what's Mr. Bunny doing now?
Jake| It's not about the bunny! The bunny is incidental to the brick experiment.
Finn| Oh. Sorry, man.
Jake| Forget about the bunny.
Finn| Sorry, man.
BMO| Sorry, Jake.
Finn| Look, we'll, uh, we'll leave you alone. 
Jake| Finn? Are you still there? Finn? BMO?
Jake| Mr. Bunny retreats to its warren. Its homemade comfort is some consolation to help pass the hungry night. Twilight falls on the peaceful forest, a twilight unaware of the struggles it both soothes and conceals. The crickets begin to stir, rehearsing their musical rhapsodies. In the distance, flashes of heat lightning illuminate a purple summer sky. Even angry deer, at last, must come to rest. And so it is with our erstwhile antagonist, who has disappeared into a stand of trees, perhaps to dream of tomorrow's pointless battles.
Jake| Oh, my Gob, it's a crazy storm! This might be it! This weather might knock the whole thing down! 
Jake| If a definition of bravery exists, then this must be it. A lone bunny, facing off against the elements, ineffectually pushing around some twigs with his pink bunny nose, a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but sometimes that's all we have. The wind is beginning to pick up. It's becoming clear that Mother Nature has not just knocked on the door, she has come in, sat down, and poured herself a drink. Mr. Bunny has no friends, no family, no loved ones of any kind. The wind is really picking up now. Small puddles gathering around the entrance to Mr. Bunny's cozy home are beginning to grow in size and connect with one another. It won't be long now. But what's this?! Looks like this unflagging little hero of a bunny will have some help, though! A family of friendly beavers appears to have taken up the cause.
Jake| Often called nature's architects, these intrepid mammals are sparing no effort to shore up the endangered burrow. Here's an unusual sight. It's a Sea Lard! You'd expect to see a few mudscamps out in weather like this, but here we have a rare treat indeed. This little beauty is pretty far outside of her natural habitat, but I've heard it said by wise old salts schooled in ancient maritime lore that storms will sometimes blow them off course to a remarkable degree. Looks like we've got some pretty good evidence tonight. Yes, sir, sometimes those old sailors know what they're talking about. It's a triumph of experience versus the secondhand verities of musty academic tomes. This feisty Sea Lard is pitchin' right in to save the rabbit hole, belying its slothful reputation. She uses her prodigious swiveling behind to increase the size of the hole, while the beavers continue to reinforce the sides with straw and stick. Times like these, supposed cruelty and indifference of the natural world, all too often its most salient feature, pale before the nobler instincts of even our most humble kin.
Jake| In the morning light, few signs remain of the summer storm that battered this idyllic glen. The beavers are finished with their work and are heading home. The Sea Lard looks like she's gonna wander the woods for a while. Maybe she'll find her way back to the ocean and write a novel about her experiences. Mr. Bunny is exhausted but can rest easy knowing that his home is secure. But alas, the bunny's rest is short-lived. The deer is back.
Jake| The deer, perhaps confused by the antler-like appearance of Mr. Bunny's protective dam, is now testing the situation.
Jake| The bunny is unsure of where this is going.
Jake| And with a single smash from the deer's powerful front hooves, the bunny's home is under attack! Mr. Bunny has hopped to safety and can only watch as the deer continues its relentless rampage on the only home he knows. A couple more mighty smashes, and the dam—the dam has been breached! Water is now flooding in! The deer continues its attack! This deer's misplaced rage, combined with its size and weight, is more than enough to bring down the weakened walls, which are now starting to give, aided by the unforgiving weigh from the tree above. Even Mr. Deer, in his blind fury, seems to sense what's about to happen as he steps to one side!
Jake| It's over. The warren has been destroyed.
Jake| An injustice of astronomical levels. Words fail me.
Jake| Actually, he doesn't seem that upset.
Jake| He's on his feet, checking out his new surroundings—even the deer is impressed! As if confused by the events, he performs a comical double-take and retreats into the forest. Ladies and gentlemen, this bunny is indomitable!
Jake|  This bunny has the right attitude. Who cares about being a brick in a wall of a fallen-down shack? There's something bigger than that, and the bunny has answers.  Teach me, Mr. B!
Jake| Aw.
Finn| Jake? Jake? You there, buddy? Over.
Jake| Hey, Finn.
Finn| Hey, man. You ready to come home?
Jake| That sounds good.
Finn| Awesome. See you soon.  Yus!
Finn|  Hey, Jake.
Jake|  Yeah?
Finn|  You ever wonder what a demon's heart looks like?
Jake|  Of course, dude.
Finn|  You ever wonder what a demon's heart tastes like?
Reaper|  Hey, kid... You want some magic powers...? Magic powers for absolutely free...
Finn|  Heck yeah!
Jake|   Wait! Let's not be too rash! Just look at this guy!  Check out the sunken, lifeless eyes... The foul stench of decay... You know what that means?
Finn|  Means he's evil, I guess.
Jake|  Well, evil, sure... but mostly, he's unattractive, and unattractive people are desperate. You should haggle with him!
Finn|   Hey! I want more than just free powers! What else ya got?!
Reaper|  Alright... Free magical powers and...  Eh! And this keychain.
Finn|   OH! OH! OH!
Jake|   Play it cool, Finn.
Finn|  Right.  I begrudgingly accept your offer.
Reaper|   Yes... Then the deal is struck!  WAHAHAHAHAHA!  You can pick up your powers right through that door.   This way...
Finn|  This place looks magical. You think this is where we get the powers?
Host|  Yes, I do.  Free powers for all. Want some?
Finn|  Yeah! Are you the guy handing 'em out?
Host|  You seek Bufo, the wizard!
Finn|  So, where's that guy?
Host|   He is here, of course.
Finn|  Uh...
Jake|  He's here... but he's not you.
Host|  That's right.
Jake|   We should beat 'im up until he starts makin' sense!
Bufo|   We are Bufo!
Finn|  Ohhhh...
Bufo|   So... you wish to be inducted into the ancient order of— Dang it, Leonard!! If we don't talk at the same time, nobody can understand us!
Tadpole|  Sorry... geez...
Bufo|   Ahem... So... You want free wizard powers... Powers like...  these!
Finn & Jake|   Hahaha! Yeah! We want 'em! Give us the stuff!
Jake|  Oh, boy!
Finn|  Yes, we do! Can't wait!
Bufo|    Then follow....
Finn|  Whoo-hoo!
Jake|  Whoo!
Bufo|  Behold the Grand Hall of Wizardry!  This is where young potentials train to become Ultimate Wizards! Most are not ready for the responsibility that comes with it.
Finn|   I'm responsible, dude!
Jake|  Yeah! So am I!
Finn|   That's a lie!
Jake|  It is a lie... and I take full responsibility for it!
Bufo|  Yes, yes... very responsible. Now I bestow upon you these wizard cloaks!
Finn & Jake|  Whoa!
Finn|  Hey! This is a dress!
Jake|  Yeah! And I am into it! It's, like, gossamer!
Finn|   This way I won't be embarrassed!
Bufo|  Fine, fine. Now for every power that you accrue,  you shall receive a star badge like these.  This final star betokens the rank of Ultimate Wizard!
Finn|  Mark me, Jake. I shall have that final star!  Where do we start?!
Bufo|  Level 1—Dustomancy.
Finn|  Yeah! Dustomancy! Whatever that is! Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme!
Bufo|  To receive this power, you must first...  eat these brooms.
Finn|  Alright.  Ah, wait!  This is gross!! Man, I can't eat this!
Jake|  Yeah, you can! Do what I do! RAAAAWR!!  Oops.  Ah, there we go.
Finn|  Whoooaaa! You got a star!
Jake|  Haha! Observe my magics!
Finn|  Wait, Jake! Don't use 'em until I finish my broom!   Last... bite... 
Jake|   Dude, you got your star, too!
Finn|   WE'RE DUSTOMANCERS!  Nothing happened! This is a total ripoff!! Bufo! You tricked us! Stupid power doesn't even work!!
Bufo|  Calm yourself, boy.  You are acting hysterical. Do you not see that you are using Dustomancy? Behold...
Finn|  I'm doing this? So... I have—
Bufo|  Yes. Mastery over all dust motes. You can also read their emotions. For instance, this mote is very unhappy in his marriage.
Jake|  Well, that's... sorta cool.
Finn|"  ""Sorta"" cool?!? THIS IS RADICAL!"
Jake|  Whoo, yeah! Force that enthusiasm!
Bufo|  Are you ready for more magic?
Finn|  We get more?!
Bufo|  So much more... like Level 2... the power of... Shadowcery!  You can't see through those, right?
Finn|  Nope... Not at all.
Bufo|  To gain provenance over the shadows, place your hands into  this bowl!
Jake|   What bowl?
Bufo|  No! Cover your eyes!
Jake|   Mmmm, fine...
Bufo|  Thrust your hands into this bowl... of eyeballs.
Finn|  Eyeballs?!
Jake|  Dude, it's okay. They're just peeled grapes.
Bufo|  No! They're eyeballs...  Well done. You have groped the eyeballs fearlessly.
Finn|  Another star! Yeah! Shadowcery...  Onward, my shadow steed!  Huh?
Shadow Horse|  No touchies. 
Finn|  Wizard powers are so cool... I want ALL THE STAR BADGES!!!
Bufo|  Excellent.
Bufo|  Well done.
Finn|  All we're missing now is the big star! You ready to complete the set, man?
Jake|  Nah, I'm good.
Finn|   WHAT?! How can you stop now??
Jake|  Eh... I've got everything I need. A limitless supply of mayonnaise, this captivating new hairstyle... and I just learned the best spell of all!
Finn|  What's that?
Jake|  Sleep.
Finn|  Aw... What a lame-o.  Bufo! I'm ready to get that big star!
Bufo|  To tell true, the last power is not free.
Finn|  Wha?? You can't do this to me, man! I've got no money!
Bufo|  No, no cash. For the final star, you must take the pledge of ultimate responsibility.
Finn|   Okay. I'll take that pledge.
Bufo|  Are you sure? Perhaps you are not sufficiently familiar with—
Finn|  I'm ready!
Bufo|  Well, there may be ramifications that you cannot—
Finn|   Just let me take that pledge, man!
Bufo|  My word, I've never met someone so irresponsibly responsible. Very well, then. You must... grasp my hand.
Finn|  That's it?  Easy!  Huh?  My big star!! Yes!! Wha-hoo! Yeah!! Wait, where am I?
Bufo|  Direct your attention to the scale-model orb.
Finn|  Huh?  Is that an asteroid heading for this very temple?
Bufo|  Yes. It's been heading for this temple for 847 years. Only the magic of the ultimate wizards keeps it from getting any closer. Quickly, add your power to that of the orb.
Finn|  Oh, okay.  Whoa! I got it! Now what?
Bufo|  Now I release the elder Jeremy from his pledge. Razzamafoo!
Jeremy| It's about time... 
Bufo|  And you take his place... for the rest of your natural life.
Finn|  Awesome. ... Wait, what?!
Bufo|  This is what you signed up for when you took the pledge of ultimate responsibility.
Finn|  This is what all the wizard training was about?!  You tricked me!
Old Wizard|  Young wizard! The asteroid approaches!
Finn|  Oh, yeah. Sorry. 
Bufo|  I tricked you, of course... but would anyone really volunteer to do this?  I'm out. 
Finn|  Aw, man, this sucks.  Old people! There's gotta be a better way!
Old Wizard|  Nope... This is how the ancient ones wanted it.
Finn|  Yeah? I've got a younger idea! 
Old Wizard|  You fool! Your newfangled thinking will get us all killed!
Finn|  Youth culture forever!  Whoa.
Bufo|  Hey! Have you gone crazy?! Get back in the bouncy harness!
Finn|  Sleep! 
Bufo|  You are—! Uhh... 
Finn|  Ultimate Wizardry, activate!  ...Uh... Hm. Maybe my footing's off?  There you go!  I cast... Dragon Eyes! Tiger Claw! Vorpal Hand! Blazing Feet! Beauteous Wings! And finally... every other power I didn't mention by naaaame! With all my magics combined, I'm powerful enough to move the entire village out of the asteroid's path!  is tilted out of the main temple. Finn retracts his hand. The asteroid is approaching.]  I need some help! Jake!! Awaken!! 
Jake|   Reflect. 
Rock|  Hey, I'm alive! What's that up there?  AH! OH, NO!
Finn|  Hah... My stupid young idea will be responsible for hundreds of deaths!
Old Wizard|   It sure will!
Finn|  Huh? Old wizards! You ditched your responsibilities to help me!
Old Wizard|  What? No! We left so we wouldn't be killed by that asteroid!
Finn|   Oh, okay, um, since you're here already, could you lend me a hand??
Jake|  Huh??
Finn|  Whoo-hoo! Nice job! Thanks to us, the village is saved. And we reclaimed a few of your twilight years!
Bufo|  Don't forget to thank me. For this was my plan for all of these 847 years.
Finn|  No way! Your plan was to dupe a succession of rubes into keeping the asteroid at bay!
Bufo|   Perhaps you're right. No more giving out free powers. I hereby renounce all magic.  My life is oveeeeeer!
Finn|  Chill, man. You don't have to quit your job.
Bufo|  I don't?
Finn|  Nah. Just don't take credit for ideas that aren't yours.
Bufo|  Oh... okay...  Good idea...  Glad I thought of it...
Reaper|  Hey, naked kid. you want some free... Demon heart?!
Finn|  Aw, ha ha ha haw, yeah!
Jake|  Full circle!!
Finn|    Oh!  Parm, parm, parm.  Asiago's like parm.  Whoopsies.   Okay, now easy does it.
Finn| Ohh!
Finn|  Thanks a lot, Dad!
Jake| Finn?  What's going on?  Is the spaghetti all—whoa!  Finn, what happened?
Finn| I... messed up the spaghetti,  and then I got mad, and PB's candy arm exploded.
Jake|  Man, I knew that arm was bogus.
Finn| Yeah, it wasn't the greatest. Sorry about the spaghetti, though.
Jake| Man, don't worry about that.  You just went through some outrageous beeswax from losing your favorite arm and et cetera. You can't just expect to bounce right back to normal.
Finn| I can't?
Jake| Nah, man. Listen.  All these princesses donating all these gross fake arms—they mean well,  but they're throwing you off your game! You got to go at your own pace. If you listen  deep in your melon heart...  that's where the real instructions are.
Finn|  My melon wants to punch my dad in the face and steal his arm.
Jake|  Well, those things are bad,  so they can't be the real instructions, but you keep listening. Me—I'm going to go to the spaghetti store and buy a new mop head. I'll be back soon. Just remember—listen to your melon heart. 
Finn|  Melon heart... melon heart... man, I don't know. It'd be so easy if I could just go find him—my dad that is. That portal he went through after ripping off my favorite arm went right to outer space. And outer space is up there somewhere... I'm told. Maybe Banana Man could help me build a rocket or something...  or some stairs or... something, something, something... or, or, or.   Wow, it's like a—like a—like a magic Finn arm.  She's powerful. You must've exploded the candy arm before and made the rock pile just know. It's almost like I'm trying to tell myself something, like a message from my melon heart.
Princess Bubblegum|   Jake, Jake! Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Jake|  Afternoon Princess. What's that you're building?
Princess Bubblegum|  Wait, you don't know?
Jake|  I might.
Princess Bubblegum|   Here, look. It was taped to the tower.
Jake|   Jake, I'm going to space to punch my dad and steal his arm. Back Soon -Finn  Wow, what the he?
Princess Bubblegum| My biggest powerometer back at the castle was flipping all the way out.  It looks like Finn somehow manifested a telekinetic electro-emotional prosthesis.
Jake|  Word. Word.
Princess Bubblegum|  With this much raw power he could be a danger to himself or others. So I've quarantined the area till I can coax him down.
Jake|  Pfft. TMLO Princess.
Princess Bubblegum|  What does that mean?
Jake|  That means lay off. Finn's feeling this one out solo style. Give the kid a chance.
Finn|  Daddy's got an arm and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.  Baby's building a tower into space. Space is where he's gonna find his dad.  Daddy's got an arm and  baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.  Baby's building a tower into space. Space is where he's gonna find his dad. Daddy's got an arm, and baby's gonna harm his arm by tearing it off his dad.
Carroll|  Ahh!
Finn|  Oh, hi.
Carroll|   Get out of my house or I'm going to face blaaaast you.
Finn|  Hi.
Finn|  Waah.
Carroll|   Yep, yeah. I know you. You're one of those swimmers right? A reeeal swim nut.
Finn|  What? No, I'm Finn. 
Carroll|  Well you can't swim in me. Not anymore, I'm not water. You can't get me up your nooooose. 
Finn|   Okay, I'm going to keep going.
Carroll|  I'm going to keep going, into here. 
Finn|   Oh, baby's a tower into space. Space where he's gonna find his dad.
Jake|   Goodnight buddy, I'm proud of you.
Finn|   Baby's building a tower into space, to tear off his dad's arm.  From like where that round of the arm bone meets that weird flat bone on the top of the back. Gonna pull that until it comes off. Baby's building a tower of revenge...
Carroll|  Hey kid.  It's me again. Carroll, my name's Carroll.
Finn|  Finn.
Carroll|  Finn, look I'm sorry about blasting you yesterday. Hey man, are you really gonna do those things?
Finn|   Uh, yeah, for revenge. I think it'll feel good.
Carroll|  I get it, I get it. But let me tell you something. I used to be water. Like a pond or something real wet. I used to hate people swimming in me,  kicking and stuff. So what did I do? I evaporated, I got myself out of there.
Finn|  You should have pulled off their legs.
Carroll|  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, you have to stop obsessing about revenge.  Umph.  Be like me and run away, you have to run away and never stop hating your old life.  You gotta really dwell on it. Ah!
Finn|  What was that?
Carroll|  I just thought about my anxieties and it's like my mind hand touched a hot memory stove.
Finn|  Hmm.
Carroll|  Ah!
Finn|  Interesting. Oh hey, what are your thoughts on melon hearts?
Carroll|  I don't know what you're talking about. Alright then, I guess I'll see you later. 
BMO|  Hey Jake, where's...  Where's Finn?
Jake|  Finn's just working some stuff out,  AND IT'S HEALTHY!
Princess Bubblegum|  It's not healthy, it's bizarre and he could get hurt!
Jake|  Feelings hurt!
Princess Bubblegum|  Eeeeah.
Jake|  Eeeeeeeeeah.
BMO|  Eeah.
Carroll|   Finn! Hey what's it like up there?  I figured I could turn into spaces, or something.
Finn|   Daaaad!?  Ah. Oh man. My nog master.  Hello?  Hell-oh!  Hey, hey dad?
Martin|  Huh? Oh good, you're awake.
Finn|   Gotcha! Ha, ha, hee, hee, hee, hee.  Give, give it. Give me the... give me give it. Give me the...
Martin|  Oh, my favorite arm.
Finn|   Butts. Butts.
Princess Bubblegum|  Didn't help much did it.
Finn|  No. Wait, what?
Princess Bubblegum|  Bong Bong.  Sorry buddy.
Finn|  PB? Wait, where am I?
Princess Bubblegum|  We're in the Candy Kingdom fallout shelter.  I brought you here after you passed out on the tower. You were hallucinating like crazy so it was really easy to trick you. I figured you'd thank me later after learning your lesson.
Finn|  Right, right.
Princess Bubblegum|  And look, the arm is gone too. See?  So what do you think?
Finn|  Hmm.  Yeah, okay. Thanks Princess.
Jake|  Oh, hey buddy you're back. How are you feeling?
Finn|  Um, neutral I guess. I don't want to punch my dad anymore.
Jake|  Ha, Ha! That's great!  You can always trust the old melon heart to get you through.  So I guess we won't be needing this thing anymore. You wanna do the honors?
Finn|   Yes I do.
Princess Bubblegum|  MY ARM!!!
Doctor Princess|  Hmm....
Finn| What is it?
Doctor Princess| It's looking droopier.
Finn| But I've been pounding pickle juice like I was preggos. For the electrolytes.
Doctor Princess| Well, switch back to water. But what I really want to know, is how are you feeling Finn?
Finn| What? Oh, I don't know. , I guess I don't feel anything. Bleh. 
Doctor Princess| Okay, that's what I thought. You gotta bounce back, man. You got burned by your bad dad, you lost your arm, and all the ladies say you don't talk to Flame Princess no more.
Finn| Who's sayin' that?
Doctor Princess| Finn, flowers thrive on good vibes. As your doctor, I'm ordering you to go out and have fun, okay?
Finn| You want to go with me to Crab Princess' party tonight?
Doctor Princess| Uh, what? Like... as a date?
Finn| Sure. That would be fun, right?
Doctor Princess| Finn, I don't date my patients.
Finn| It's cool. Guess I'll go make out with Crab Princess.
Doctor Princess|" Okay. Tell her I said ""hi."""
Finn| ♪I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring? Autumn descends on me,Autumn♪
Breezy| ♪What do I see? Oh, so beautiful. My heart it beats. Oh, so magical.♪
Finn| ♪I'm lost in the darkness, what will this bring?♪
Lumpy Space Princess| Aah! Watch it, Crab Princess!
Crab Princess| I'm sorry.
Lumpy Space Princess| You ain't my man, so why are you all up in my lumps?!
Raggedy Princess|  Hey, Finn, could you pour this juice into my mouth?
Finn| What? Pfft!  Aah!
Raggedy Princess| I can't reach my juice.
Finn|  Yo, come on bee! Geez!
Breezy| Oh, I'm so sorry, I didn't realize—
Finn| Didn't realize what? That there's a person attached to this flower?
Breezy| Uh, yes. I'm sorry. But it's only because your flower's the greatest miracle of all time. It's just doing something to me, I—
Finn| Oh, that's cool. Thanks, beezy.
Breezy| My name's Breezy.
Raggedy Princess|  Never mind, Finn. 
Breezy| So uh, what are you doing here? Heh.
Finn| Ah, well, I came here to make out with Crab Princess, but I sort of lost steam on the walk over.  I don't know what crabs are into. I'm just gonna stop trying and let my flower wilt away. Who cares?
Breezy| I'll try for you, man.
Finn| Whoa! Really?
Breezy| Yeah! I'm gonna help you, friend.
Crab Princess| Hey, Emerald Princess, you know what would blow this party up?
Emerald Princess| What?
Crab Princess| If we all got in a line and just showed off our moves.
Lumpy Space Princess| Yeah! Do it! Oh, my glob! Aah ha ha! Haa!
Crab Princess| Thanks for walking me home, Finn. I'd invite you over, but you can't breathe underwater, right?
Finn| Not usually, but can I have a kiss, please?
Crab Princess| Uh, okay...
Finn| Okay. Good night, Crab Princess.
Crab Princess| Good night, Finn! 
Breezy| Hey, you did it!
Finn| Oh, you're still here.
Breezy| Yeah,  just checking in... on my buddy. So, how you feelin', buddy?
Finn|" Pretty grease. I made out with Crab Princess, so that's grease. But really I don't feel nothing. Maybe if I made out, I will feel something? Maybe I'll reach a ""good vibe"" saturation point. And then my flower will feel good, too..."
Breezy| Your flower feels good, yes.
Finn|  Hey, cut it out, Breezy.
Breezy| Ha ha! I'm just messin' around. We're buddies, right?
Finn| Yeah, Breezy, I like you. You're a good wingman.
Breezy| Yeah, wingman. I'm a girl, but all right! Let's wingman you some make-outs!
Jake| Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
Finn| What's up with your head?
Jake| Eh, I'm trying something new. Hey, how's it going, miss...?
Frozen Yogurt Princess| Frozen Yogurt Princess.
Jake| Whoa. You're a dead ringer for Flame Princess, with a smidge of Princess Bubblegum mixed in.  Guess you're still hung up on both of 'em, bro.
Finn|  I ain't hung up on nobody! Nobody. Breezy, let's get out of here.
Breezy| Okay.
Finn| She doesn't look anything like Flame Princess, does she?
Breezy| I don't know who that is.
Finn| Exactly.  I'm just trying to have fun. You know, doctor's orders. But I still ain't feelin' nothing.  maybe I should just let this poor flower die.
Breezy| Noooo... Listen, buddy, being a free spirit is fun and all, but you got a responsibility to that flower, just like I got a responsibility. Get this—I'm actually a virgin queen bee. I was born to lead a hive, destined for a life of obligation and ritual.
Finn| Whoa. Bummer.
Breezy| Yes. Once I drink of the royal jelly, my carefree days are done.
Finn| Dang. That sounds like raw deez. Breezy, you got to stay free... Free to make out with whatevs. 
Breezy| Yeah, maybe you're right. You know, it's too bad we're such great buddies or we could make out with each other. 
Finn| What?
Breezy| Uh, nothing. Come on, pal! Lets run and be free. 
Breezy| Whoops! I tripped right into you  
Breezy| That's right. Everybody's havin' fun...
Finn| Whoops!
Both| Whoa!
Bee Person| What's that?
Bee Person| Mnh-mnh! Hey, girl! Girl, I know you can hear me! 
Bee Person| Girl, get back to your hive! Quit hanging out with that bologna tube! It's disgusting!
Finn| Mnh-mnh.  Yo! Shut it! She's an independent lady!
Breezy| Yeah, shut it!
Bee Person| A'ight!  Hey! You guys want to roast a wiener?
Other Bee People|  Yeah!
Bee Person| Gonna teach you to mind your b's and q's, chump!  Buzzzzz!
Finn| Uh! Run, Breezy!
Finn| Aah!
Bee Person| You're about to get waggle-danced, you chicken!  Unh!
Finn| Ow! Ooh! 
Breezy| Oh, no! Flower! I-I mean Finn! 
Breezy|  aha!  Don't worry, Finn!  I jacked some royal jelly from their hive! 
Finn|  Breezy... No!
Breezy|   Aaaah.
Breezy| Hey, honeybuns!
Bee Person| Whoa! Oh, No! She got into our secret sauce, bro! It's all over!  Long live the queen!
Finn|  Breezy?
Breezy| Yes, Finn. Can't you see? I've become a queen to save you because... I love your flower and—and I think... I love you!  Now you can partake of my pollen crumbles and become my drone.
Finn| Um... You know, I'm—I'm trying to keep it casual, B. I just don't feel the same way. I don't feel anything.
Breezy|  But I royal jellied for you. 
Finn| I'm lost in the darkness, Breezy.
Lumpy Space Princess| Finn.  Finn.  I saw this already!    I know all about your dirty deeds. Now it's Lumpy's turn to slump those lips! Bring it in, baby.
Lumpy Space Princess| Wha? Where you going?
Finn| That's it. We made out.
Lumpy Space Princess| Wha—What?! I didn't wait infinity for a dip in the kiddie pool! We're taking this to the deep end!
Finn| But I'm not a good swimmer.
Lumpy Space Princess| Don't be scared, Finn. Lumpy's on lifeguard duty.
Finn|  How's it going, guy? Is any of this helping?
Finn| I'm gonna forget you did that. Right in the vault.
Finn| Whoa, whoa, whoooooa!
Finn|  Yeah! Whoo-hoo!
Lumpy Space Princess|  What the lump? Oh, hey! Finn, you got your arm back!
Finn|  Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Breezy...
Princess Bubblegum| What the? Why's it so purple outsi—
Princess Bubblegum| What?!
Peppermint Butler| It's too smoky to see...
Peppermint Butler| Oh! Something's peeking. Someone's jacking your spaceship!
Princess Bubblegum| That is my ship! But it looks like it's been modded out. That much engine power, it'll break through the atmosphere before I can do anything to stop it!  Finn and Jake! Yeah, get that guy!
Finn| My thorn!  I think we should go inside.
Jake| Oof! 
Finn| Gunther! What're you doing?!
Gunter|  What am I doing? A fog shrouds my true intent, even from myself. There!  The Catalyst Comet! It all becomes clear. I am more than Gunther.  Like a mighty chrysalis pushing out of a damp cocoon—  —I emerge!
Finn| Jake! You okay?!
Jake| Yeah, man, just don't croak out here.  Hey, man, look at Gunter.
Orgalorg| Behold!  I am Orgalorg! 
Jake| Whoa. That's pretty.  Looks good, right?
Orgalorg| Hey. Where's Glob?
Finn| Uh, I dunno.  He exploded in space.
Orgalorg| Yeah, I thought so.
Jake| Man, are you still Gunter? 'Cause you seem like you're not.
Orgalorg| I'm Orgalorg.
Finn| Well, what the heck are you doing, Orgalorg?
Orgalorg| It was just time to come out again. Glob K.O.'ing himself—  —the arrival of the Catalyst Comet—  —and a ship to carry me out of this planet's gravity.  These are doorways the universe presented to me.
Jake| Ohhh, I know about open door philosophy!
Finn| What's that? You just say yes to stuff all the time?
Jake| Pretty much.
Finn|  That seems alright.
Orgalorg| It's all yours if you're willing to take it. Destroy worlds—  —crush anyone blocking the door. Feel their bones crumple and their goo spill out.
Finn| I don't like that at all.
Jake|  He made it ugly.
Orgalorg| You can't stop me; I'm Orgalorg.
Finn|  I'm pretty sure I can take you, bro.
Orgalorg| Not after I absorb the power and knowledge of that comet.
Finn|  Absorb a triple salchow to your kneecaps!
Finn|  Grab my hand!
Jake| Okay.
Jake| Shoot. Hey, stop drifting!
Finn| I'm not trying to!
Jake| Ooh, maybe I can use jet propulsion!  Oh no, I can't breathe!
Finn| Jake, no! Don't worry, man, I'm working out a plan!  Freakin' bing-bong! Jake's gonna fulfill his croak dream after all! And that dirty umbrella is gonna enslave the universe!
Orgalorg|  Cram, come on, this is gonna take forever.
Finn| Man, I'm gonna croak out here! Like a fish in the hands of a child! 
Finn|  Okay, Finn. Time to make an appeal to greater forces. 
Martin| Hey, spaceman.
Finn| Wha—Dad?!
Martin| Heh, this is so crazy, Finn! What're you doing out here?
Finn| Floating to my grave! Hurry up and save me!
Martin| Can't, buddy—  —this baby does what it wants!
Finn| Are you kidding me?!
Martin| No, for real. Look!  Hey!  Get that guy there!
Martin| See? I'm just  flying random-style.
Finn| It's not random! I merged my intention with the universe!
Martin| You what?  Oh! Wait, I have an idea.
Finn| Really?
Martin| Here.  Grab on this.
Martin| Nah, it's cool, you got gloves on.
Finn| Oh, yeah. 
Martin| You alright?
Finn|  Yeah. Thanks, Dad.  Thanks, universe.
Martin| Come again?
Finn|  Oh! We gotta save Jake.  He's out there chokin' on gas!
Martin|  Like I said, I got no control over this beast.  We're on a journey into mystery, unless I can figure out what this bozo responds to.
Martin|" It's kinda fun, right? See, there's no reason, or purpose, or what you said, uh, ""universal intention.""  Look around, Finn. Empty crud. So empty."
Finn|  I dunno, there's some stars and stuff.
Martin|  You're squeezed so tight, your bottom's gonna fall out. Put the phone down! 
Finn| Put the phone down?
Martin| Ye—  WHOO! What's going on, huh?
Finn|  Look! The light of the comet!
Martin| Ah!  That's pretty neat.  This moth is so bananas, man.
Finn| Bananas man... bananas man...
Martin|  Uh oh, what's that?
Orgalorg|  Almost there...
Finn| That dude's gonna absorb the comet's mystical power and crush everybody. Who the heck raises guys like that? You think he had neglectful parents like you, or had he always been a no-good Orgalorg?
Martin| Oh, gobslops, not Orgalorg!
Finn| Y-you know him?
Martin| Yeah, what do you think; I'm a dumb brick?! I don't know Orgalorg?
Orgalorg| Ahaha, oh, yeah. 
Finn| Snaps! He ate the comet!
Finn| I gotta stop him.
Martin| It's too late, buddy; it's out of our hands.
Finn| Scronk that! I'm gonna use these hands—  —to sock him in the chops! In the chops!
Finn| Aahh!
Finn| Hey! Dinglord! In the name of—  the universe—  stop that!
Finn|  Grass Sword.
Orgalorg|  I didn't open this door!
Finn| Cool.
Catalyst Comet| Finn, do you remember?
Finn| Yeah, I-I think so. A long time ago—  —I was you, sorta. And I crashed on Earth. And became a butterfly or some biz.  And I guess—  it was just some random, absurd thing. Just a joke I've been playing out for centuries.
Catalyst Comet| Who's creating the joke? Are you? And, if so, then are you my creator?
Finn| Uh—maybe? I dunno. Probably not.
Catalyst Comet| Probably not, but who knows? I've been around forever and experienced so much impossible junk. I've embodied all that is good—and evil . And now we're here. It's unprecedented. And I give you a choice. Come with me to end—and the beginning?  Or struggle here awhile like a beautiful autumn leaf.
Finn| What's that bell sound?
Martin|  Cool, man.
Catalyst Comet| This is your crisis. As you stand on the edge of freedom from Love. Hate. Friendship. Isolation. Jealousy. Secrets. Violence. Video games. Ice cream waffles. Sadness. Madness. Power. Honor. Loyalty. Saucy. Mothers. Fathers. Scoundrels.
Finn| How long are you gonna list stuff?
Catalyst Comet| It's a long list.
Finn| You're tellin' me to abandon all this stuff—  —but you're not really making it sound bad.
Catalyst Comet| It's not bad. I'm just giving you the choice of a new mode of existence.
Finn| I feel like I put a lot of work into this meat reality. I'd like to see it through.
Catalyst Comet| Fair enough.
Martin| Hey, how 'bout I get a new mode?
Finn| Are you seriously trying to bail out again?!
Martin| What? This deal sounds pretty good!
Finn|  Dad.
Martin| Uh oh. I know that look.
Finn| When you fled the scene like a ding-dong ditcher in the night—
Martin| Listen, Finn. No answer I give you will be satisfying. Besides, it was, like, 40 years ago.
Finn| I'm 16!
Martin| I don't have a star to revolve around to track time.
Finn| But why do you always run from everything?!
Martin|  You burn enough bridges, the only direction to move is forward.
Finn|  Hmm. Well, there ain't no changin' you, I guess.
Martin| Well, I'm glad we finally understand each other.  Start the engine, comet boy!
Catalyst Comet| Prepare to discorporate.
Martin| Goodbye, son!
Finn| Bye, Dad. Should've asked for a lift home.
Finn| JAKE! I thought I had lost...... you... NO!
Jake| You okay, Finn?
Finn|  What? 
Finn| Jake?! Banana Man?! How?
Jake| Well, I was just floatin' around, and I drifted into B-Man's flight path. Pretty random—  —right?
Finn| It wasn't random; I did it.
Jake|  Let's get the jazz outta here.
Orgalorg| No...
Gunter|  
Peppermint Butler|  There we go, see? Problem took care of itself!
Princess Bubblegum| You think Finn and Jake are alright?
Peppermint Butler| I'd say it's about a 50/50 chance.
Princess Bubblegum| That's pretty much everything in life, isn't it?
Peppermint Butler| Yeah—Whoa!  What's that?
Finn|  Hey, PB! We took care of it.
Princess Bubblegum|  Good job, guys!
Fish|  Mm, I'm gonna croak out here.
Jake|  And as it waded through the carnage that it had wrought, the vampire smashed their skulls just for the fun of it!
Finn|  No way!
Jake|  Yes way, it did. And also the vampire hunched over its victims and breathed their vaporized blood mist.
Finn|  Ah, jeez! Jake, is this stuff you're saying true? Or are you just trying to mess me up? You have to be honest.
Jake|  Oh, it's true, man. I heard it through a reliable source.
Finn|  Reliable? Rats!
Jake|  Yeah. Some say it haunted this very tree!
Finn|  This tree?!
Jake|   Good niiiight...
Finn|  Jake?
Finn|  You're full of it, Jake!
Finn| Errr...  NO WORMS ON THE BED! 
Finn|  Huh? 
Finn|  AAAAAH!!! 
Finn|  Jake! Jake! I saw someone outside the window! It must be the vampire, and I think we're unprepared, so I--
Jake|  Relax, buddy. I made that story up. I was just trying to scare you.
Finn|  But you said you heard it from a reliable source!
Jake|  Ha ha! I made that up, too. I was trying to scare you, and it worked! 
Finn|  No one's outside.
Jake|  Whew!
Finn|  It was just the wind, scaredy-cat.
Jake|  I wasn't scared, I was singing. I was singing my scream song. Ahh! Ahh! AAaah-uh-aah!
Finn|  You're a total wuss, man.
Marceline| Hey, guys. What's up? I'm Marceline the Vampire Queen.
Finn|   Are you gonna smash my skull and breathe my blood mist?!
Jake|  Don't suck our blood!
Marceline|   Calm down, weenies. I'm not gonna do that. 
Finn|  Soooo, you don't suck blood?
Marceline|  Sometimes, I do. But it's not the blood that I like. It's the color. I eat shades of red.
Marceline|"  Ugh, I am exhausted. I've been traveling all over the Land of Ooo. And I've seen some stuff that would really make you say ""like what?"""
Finn|  Like what?
Marceline|  I encountered a school of goldfish beasts. 
Marceline|  And I fooled around in the Fire Kingdom. 
Finn|  OOO!
Marceline|  Oh, and check these out. 
Finn|  Nuts?
Marceline| Oh, these aren't ordinary nuts. 
Finn|   You're wonderful.
Jake|  Um, yeah. Thank you for not sucking our blood.
Marceline|  You guys seem cool, too, but as you can imagine, I'm really tired, so you two should probably get going.
Finn|  What?
Marceline|"   Look.  ""M"" for ""Marceline."""
Jake|  Aw, man.
Marceline|  I carved in this tree years ago. Way before you two rascals started squatting here. 
Marceline|  But seriously guys, thanks for keeping the place warm for me, I mean really great!
Marceline|  Good night!
Jake|  Come on, Finn. Let's get out of here.
Finn|  She can't kick us out of our house!
Jake|  Finn!
Finn|  Get down here, lady, and fight me!
Jake|  She's a vampire, dude!
Finn|  I'm gonna kill her.
Jake|  Dude, if half the stories I've heard, and/or made up are true, vampires will kill you. There's no question!
Finn|  But, what about our home?
Jake|  A VAMPIRE TOOK IT! Aw, we should go house-hunting. Bag us a new house.
Finn|  But I like our home.
Jake|  Finn, house-hunting is wild! You've got to try it.
Finn|  Really?
Jake|  Yeah, man! It is so nuts!
Finn|  You always know what to say.
Jake|  Bla-bla-bla-ble-ble-bla-bloo-bloop!
Finn|  Okay. I'm convinced. Let's roll!
Jake|  Sweet, things are gonna start going our way.  Hey, look, see? What'd I tell ya?
Finn|  This is weak! I don't even like any of these places. I wanna go home.
Jake|  Finn, let me tell you a little something about what home really means.  La, la, la...  Home isn't a place, let me give you a clue... Home is anywhere, where people care about you...
Finn|  I don't wanna hear a lecture, dude! I just wanna go home...
Jake|   But, home is where your heart is, Finn! And where is your heart, Finn? Well, it's right here inside you when I'm sitting here beside you!  With your lucky stars to guide you from above. 
Finn|  Yeah, I guess I'd rather be out here, wrapped in your ear, than be in some awesome house all by my... souse.
Jake|  I'd rather be dancing with some babes!
Finn|   Shut up, dude!
Jake|  Ew... Gross. This place looks gross!
Finn|  And abandoned. 
Finn|   Whoa, bro... Wanna just live in here?
Jake|  Yes.
Jake|  So whaddaya think, man? We did pretty good for ourselves.
Finn|  Yeah, we did... So, ah, what should we do first with our new digs?
Jake|  Let's trash it and throw a party!
Finn|  Ah this is it, feelin' good, I'm feelin', I'm feelin' like we did it. I'm feelin', like, completely satisfied. Nothin' else could go wrong, ya know, Jake?
Jake|  Yeah, man.
Finn|  Aww, yeah, I know, too.
Marceline|  Hey, Finn.
Jake|  She's back!
Marceline|  Wow, pretty awesome party ya got here.
Finn|  What do you want, Marceline?!
Marceline|  Oh, I just wanna show you somethin'. This cave belongs to me!
Finn|  What!?
Marceline|  Thanks for fixing the place up for me.
Finn|  Y-You can't take our home twice!
Marceline|   Yes, I caaaannnnnn!
Finn|  AAAAAAAHHHH! It's vampire-fighting time!
Jake|  Finn! Nooo! Vampires will kill you... remember!?
Finn|  But she's taking our home again!
Jake|  We're home as long as we're together, bla-bla-bleep-bla-bloop, remember!?
Finn|  Oh, yeah. Okay, Marceline, I'm gonna let you keep this cave, but only because Jake is my home, and he's way better than all your homes combined!
Marceline|  Ya know, you're right. I guess I'll take him too!
Jake|  
Finn|  What!?
Marceline|  I'll bite him a little, maybe turn him into a zombie.
Jake|  Nooo!
Finn|  Let go of Jake!
Marceline|  Make me.
Finn|  You okay, pal?
Marceline|   No one... makes me... let go... of Jake!
Finn|  I'm not scared of you!
Jake|  Finn!
Marceline|   You're pathetic, little boy!
Finn|   You're pathetic!  Get ready for an uppercut, you dog!
Marceline|  Make me.  Bleh-bleh! Blah!
Jake|  I've... gotta help my buddy.
Marceline|  Your blood is mine!
Jake|  
Finn|   Jake!
Jake|  Uh oh.
Finn|  
Marceline|  Ow! That actually hurt, Finn. 
Finn|  Why didn't you just kill me?
Marceline|  'Cuz that was fun! I haven't fought like that in years! Thanks, Finn.
Jake|  Finn!
Finn|  Aren't you dead?
Jake|  Naaah, before she bit me I used my powers to shrink all my guts and blood over my thumb, see? 
Marceline|   You two are pretty hardcore. I can appreciate that.
Finn|  Soooo so does that mean we can have our old house back?
Marceline|  Yeah! Keep it, as a gift from me. Blaeargh!
Finn and Jake|  Yeah!
Finn|  Huh? Did you guys get on the bed? I told you, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED!

Jake| Pshhh. Please, not even. 
Finn| No, man, you blew into chunks over there! 
Jake| Uh, because Kee-Oth was right there! A-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. Uuuuuhhh...

Prismo|  Huh hmm huh hmm huh hmm. I can't wait to get this batch of pickles to Jake. He's totes gonna bust a pipe when he gets hit with the cumin and the undertones of sage that come in later. 
Jake|  Prismo, I'm right here! Where you going, bro!? 
Jake|  Wait up, man, how're you alive!?  Finn and I saw your old man host body get destroyed by the— 
Jake|  The Lich?!
The Lich| Wake up.
Prismo| Wa—Wait, I've changed my mind—
Jake|  Wait, why is this happening? It's like a rerun of the worst junk.
Jake|  Lich life-sucks Prismo's dream host, eliminates Prismo forever. Ugh, it's mad gris bro. And then the Space Police, or whatever they're called, show up because boppin' Prismo is a cosmic crime. I remember feelin' like someone had peeled a layer away from my brain, and my reality was no longer anchored to any point of reference, and I had to fight to keep from being crushed under the weight of an unforgiving new paradigm of ultimate reality. So cool, man. So why am I seeing this again?
Jake| Uhhh, that's cool...
Jake| Uhh, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough guy contest!  Whoo-hoo!  Tough boys!
Jake| Come on, man! Tough Guy contest me!
Finn|  Okay, seems like all of Jake's remanifesting themselves,  but as soon as I break their history it creates a paradox and Jake explodes.
Jake|  Whoa, Finn, how'd you get over there? 
Jake| Finn, when I die my individual Earth consciousness is going to go all over everywhere while Glob tallies my deeds.
Finn|  What?
Jake| I'm going to all around you , in your nose, in your dreams and your socks...
Finn|" ""in your dreams?"""
Jake| Yeah, that's what I said, in your dre— 
Finn| All this striz happened when Jake and I tried to preserve Prismo's pickles in our dreams, something must have changed when we went to sleep!
Finn|  So, ugh, I just got to hope that Jake tries to do the pickle ritual again. So I can re-enact it with him. Exactly the way it happened, maybe?! Geez!

Prismo| That's right, Prismo is nothing but the dream of a wrinkly old man.
Jake| What if the whole world was just some goof's dream? Man, that would be stupid. Whoa!
Jake| Rrrm, wait a minute... What is this!? This couldn't be a...oh Grod!  Permanent, opposing, industrial-strength, magnetic bed!  Hand-hewed from a single tree  Oh, man! Look at this mattress!

Prismo| Yep, I'm still dead. I'm actually talking to you from the past, I set up this plan B scenario in case I ever got croaked for reals. So if this is happening then I guess I got croaked and my pickles ran out. But Jake and I established a bro-bond that could bring me back through his dreams.
Finn| So, are you actually talking to me right now or are you pretending to in an empty room?
Prismo| I was pretending, but now I can see you.

Finn| Uh, yes. Although I gotta say that this is as rickety as yoga balls.
Revived Prismo| Yeah, tell me about it.
Finn| You tell you about it!
Revived Prismo| I think you would blow up if I did that.
Finn| Well, anyway, here I go.  Hey, Jake, wake up.
Revived Prismo| I'm out. 
Jake|  Hey, Finn, what's going on?
Finn| We gotta bounce.
Jake|  No, bro, don't tear me away from nirvana. Wait, nooo!  Oof!  I'm okay now.
Finn| Cool  this way!
Past Jake| Whoa! Rrrm, wait a minute... What is this!?
Jake| Prismo?! You're alive! 
Prismo| Well, not yet. Finn, in a second you've gotta stop yourself from waking up Jake.
Finn|  Stop my who?
Prismo|  Shoot! Hide!
Past Finn| Think we should turn around somewhere, I feel like we're lost.
Past Prismo| No I was just stalling, don't think about it, c'mon, this way.
Prismo| THAT who.
Prismo| But wait, Jake, that means one of your alternate reality incarnations will sleep for eternity to keep me alive.
Jake| Cool, dude!
Prismo| OK, Finn, I'm not sure what'll happen if you confront yourself. He might explode.
Finn| 'He', me or other me?
Prismo| You know what? Forget it.
Finn| Shut it Prismo, heroes risk everything for their friends. Although I admit you're more Jake's friend than mine. Sometimes you can think someone is totally cool, but you never become besties. Now I don't know why that happens, but regardless let's do this. 
Prismo| Good luck!
Revived Prismo| Whoa, Finn, hey! Are you gonna wake up Jake?
Past Finn|  Yeah, is that gonna kill you again though?
Prismo| My past self is doing plan B, right?
Finn|  PLAN B!
Past Finn|  What the—!? 
Finn| This is me? This sword is me?
Prismo| Finn sword, dude.
Finn| Welcome back, Prismo.
Prismo| Thank you, Finn.
Jake|  Welcome back, Prismo.
Prismo| Thank you, Jake.
Starchie| Noooooo! Get away from me, you butchers!
Princess Bubblegum| Starchie, you have a cold. The cure is right here. Just let me-
Starchie| Starchie only takes magic!
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, come on.
Starchie|  Find me a wizard!
Princess Bubblegum|  Nurse Pound Cake, hold Starchie while I administer the serum.
Nurse Pound Cake|  
Princess Bubblegum|  What?
Nurse Pound Cake| Look, I'm a nurse and all, but my uncle is a magic worker and he cured my sadness about my marriage.
Princess Bubblegum|  Listen, all magic is scientific principles presented like mystical hoo-doo, which is fun but it's sort of irresponsible. I got your magic right here, okay? And razzle dazzle! Flooby-doo! Zamabamafoo!
Starchie| Is that a real spell?
Princess Bubblegum| No, I'm making fun of spells.
Starchie|  Princess, you're being really disrespectful of my beliefs!
Nurse Pound Cake|  That was very close-minded!
Princess Bubblegum| Starchie, I just want to help.
Princess Bubblegum| All right! You want me to go to Wizard City and get you a cold spell?
Princess Bubblegum| You still think I'm a jerk?  All right, sit tight.
Finn| How is he?
Princess Bubblegum| He's still sick.
Jake| Yo, that stinks! Tonight's part 3 of his graveyard secrets workshop.
Finn| Yeah, prubs, give him the mediçon.
Princess Bubblegum| He won't take it. He wants me to get him a cold spell from Wizard City.
Finn and Jake| Oh, okay.
Jake| That makes sense.
Princess Bubblegum|  dude, you guys! Really?
Jake| Yeah, I mean, magic's probably more natchy for your body in the long run.
Princess Bubblegum|  Have you two been to Wizard City?
Finn|" Nope. ""Wizards only."""
Jake| Wizards don't play.
Finn| Trespassers get killed mad quick, like zap-zap.
Princess Bubblegum| Well, then what?
Finn| Let's stay home. Just kidding.
Princess Bubblegum| All right, meet me outside of Wizard City in your freshest wizard johns.
Starchie|  H-hurry, princess.
Finn| This is it?
Jake| Yeah, man, this is it.
Finn| Well, what's with the wall?
Jake| Wo-o-o-o-o-o-o-op! 
Finn| What's over there?
Jake| Nothing. Just more mountains. I think the wall knows we're not wizards.
Finn| But we can trick it, right?
Jake| How do you trick a wall?
Finn| Don't know, man. I give up.
Jake| For reals?
Finn| Yeah, I'm no good at this!  Unh! Oof!
Jake|  That was a nice try, man.
Princess Bubblegum| Guys, hold up! I got the password from the Ice King. Apparently, the barrier only responds to the voice of real wizards. 
Ice King|  No way! I'm no rat! I am bound by the sacred trust of esoteric knowledge!
Princess Bubblegum| Say the password, Ice King!
Ice King| You think I'll just hand you the keys to the city? I'd rather die.
Princess Bubblegum| Say the password.
Ice King| Ow! My pinky!  Ow.  Thank you.  You know, no one has touched me in months. Could you touch me again?
Princess Bubblegum| Password! Now!!'
Ice King|" Ow! Ohh! Ohh! ""Wizards Rule!"" THE PASSWORD IS WIZARDS RULE!"" AAH--"
Finn| Whoa.  Powerful magicks.
Princess Bubblegum| Pshh! It's a vocal registry rigged to a vibration modulator. The wall's still there. It's just the density's all wobbled.
Jake| Boo.
Princess Bubblegum| Um...That's what it is, Jake.
Jake| All right, what am I, then?  This don't look like magic to you?
Princess Bubblegum| It looks like a mutation.
Jake| Boring.
Princess Bubblegum| Yeah, right. Just 'cause I know my shnoz.  Look at these dopes. Half of these spells are all working on entanglement principles.
Finn|" ""Entanglement"" is a spell where you get trapped in tree roots, and sometimes they spike out and hook your flesh, and you got to be like, ""My body is clay, my spirit feels no pain."" Then you chop your way out and kill the wizard!"
Princess Bubblegum| That's not what I meant, but whatevs. Where's this magic shop?
Finn|  These signs are weird. Let's ask somebody. Hey, dudes.  Yo, where's the--
Wizard Policeman| Stand back, citizen.
Finn| Yeesh. Okay. Who are these guys?
Princess Bubblegum| They're like the city po-po or something.
Wizard Policeman|  Stranson Doughblow, you are guilty of impersonating a wizard, as well as purchasing magic items from Ron James' Spell Palace.
Princess Bubblegum| Bingo.
Stranson Doughblow| Wait! I know some coin tricks!
Wizard Policeman| The sentence is... 
Stranson Doughblow| Woaah!
Finn| Oh, my shrah!
Princess Bubblegum| Come on.
Finn| You saw that, right?
Ron James| Welcome, brothers! Sorry about that biz outside.
Princess Bubblegum| Ha ha ha! Oh, what a silly non-magic user, right?
Ron James|"  All right, bros. Ronny James got mad spells for wizards of all exps. No need for memorization, incantation, or hard-to-find bularoo. Just rip one of these babies open, and you'll be like, ""ta-da!"" We got a bottle-returns program and all that shwazaa. So, wha-za?"
Jake| We need a spell for the cold.
Ron James| Heck, yeah, brah. I got something.  Oof!  This baby right here — right here? — This is what you want, brothers.
Princess Bubblegum| How's it work?
Ron James|  It works by magic. It's a spell.
Jake| Dude...
Princess Bubblegum| What? I'm curious. So, what's in it?
Ron James| It's my secret brew, dawg.
Princess Bubblegum| So you want to sell me a product with no information?
Ron James|  It's a cold spell.
Princess Bubblegum|  Made from what?
Ron James|  MAGIC.
Princess Bubblegum|  What's the magic made out of, ding-dong?
Ron James|  Y'all is fakes!
Finn|  No, wait!
Ron James|   Bam!
Wizard Policeman|  You're busted!
Princess Bubblegum|  Yoink!  Dang. 
Finn|   Hey, Jake?
Jake|  What?
Finn|  Is PB straight-up naked right now?
Jake|  Dude, don't make me feel any more awkward than I already do!
Princess Bubblegum|  Dang! It's a dead end!
Abracadaniel|  
Finn and Jake|  Abracadaniel!
Abracadaniel|  Huh? Do I know you?
Finn|  Dude, it's me, Finn! Quick, let us in!
Abracadaniel|  Oh, guys, I don't know, that's not my place. I just work here and I-
Princess Bubblegum|  Please!
Finn|  Come on, man!
Jake|  Shush!
Finn|   Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Bufo|  Yeah, when the lamb comes back, Laser Wizard puts him on the altar.
Forest Wizard|  And then I extract his forehead, right, Bufo?
Ice King|   Ooh!
Bufo|  Right, yeah, that's the plan.
Forest Wizard|  What the blutt, Abracadaniel?!
Bufo|"   What part of ""secret society"" don't you understand?"
Jake|  Whoa, whoa, whoa! We don't want trouble!
Finn|  Just let us rest for a bit.
Laser Wizard|  Oh, we gonna put you to rest. For good!
Wizard Policeman|  You are guilty of harboring non-magic users!
Bufo|  Barrier! 
Forest Wizard|  We need an exit!
Jake|   That's what you get for asking a magician about his tricks, PB!
Bufo, the Forest Wizard, and the Laser Wizard|  Ghosts of the warp-plane, grant us passage into your realm. 
Abracadaniel|   Hey, guys, wait for me!
Finn|  Shush!
Ice King|  Whoa!
Wizard Policeman|  Receive your just punishment!
Princess Bubblegum|  No! As ruler of the Candy Kingdom, I demand parley with the Grand Master Wizard!
Grand Master Wizard|"  Princess Bubblegum! For shame. And I'm very disappointed in you,  Abracadaniel! However, Princess, since you have always been a dear friend to the wizard community, just say ""Wizards Rule"" and you're all free to go."
Abracadaniel|  Wha-? Really?
Grand Master Wizard|   Mmm?
Jake|  Psst! Wizards rule!
Princess Bubblegum|  No!
Grand Master Wizard|   Oh! 
Princess Bubblegum|   All magic is science! You just don't know what you're doing, so you call it magic! And, well.., it's.. ridiculous.
Grand Master Wizard|  Wizard prison! All of you! Wizard prison!
Abracadaniel|  Nooooooo!
Jake|  Ridiculous, huh?
Abracadaniel|  This isn't happening!
Wizrd Policeman|  Ho! 
Abracadaniel|  Ouch!
Criminal 1|  Would you look at that?
Criminal 2|  Somebody better start crying into my hand!
Finn|  Ugh! That's sick!
Criminal 3|   You're right. I'm so ashamed. 
Finn|  Ugh!
Jake|   Ouch! 
Wizard Policeman|  Come on! Move it!  You two, in here! I got cells upstairs for Princess and Milkface.
Finn|   I got traumatized by those underpanties.  This sucks.
Jake|  Hey, let's count the days.  One.
Finn|   Hey, PB, are you okay?
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeah, I'm okay.
Jake|  Sleep tight, Princess!
Princess Bubblegum|  Good night.  Stupid wizards...
Finn|  PB! Over here! 
Finn|  Whoa! 
Abracadaniel|  Bubblegum, I hereby challenge you to an honorable prison stabbing to the death!
Princess Bubblegum|  BRING IT ON. 
Finn|  What?! Are you two crazy?!
Princess Bubblegum|  I've had it with you silly wizards!
Finn|  Jake, we have to do something!
Finn|  We need to get out of this.
Jake|  Yeah, we still got to heal the snuffins out of Starchie with this little baby here. 
Finn|   All this for a cold spell.  What the-? Ice?  Hmm.
Eyepatched Criminal|  Hey, Milkface isn't dead! 
Abracadaniel|  Strike me down and restore my honor.
Princess Bubblegum|  No!!
Eyepatched Criminal|  Sorry, but you have to kill him. Otherwise, we'll kill all of yous two both.
Finn|  Peebs! Incoming! 
Princess Bubblegum|  What?
Finn|  It's a cold spell, not a cold spell.
Wizard Policeman|  Prisoner, drop that contraband magic!
Princess Bubblegum|   Whoa! 
Finn|  Get down! 
Finn|  Your magicks are powerful, PB.
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay. Let's get out of here.
Finn|  Poor Starchie. All that trouble and we couldn't get any magic for him.
Princess Bubblegum|  Hmm. I've got an idea.
Starchie|  
Abracadaniel|  Oooooo!
Starchie|  Eh? Finally! Healing magic. Oh, I can feel it!
Starchie|  No!
Princess Bubblegum|   Rubeldubel dingeldongel- Pffrt!
BMO|"  Dancing is cool! Check it out, yo!  Aaa! Ha haa! This one is called ""The Worm""!  Aaaaah!!"
BMO|" Oh no, it's crazy far.  Okay, now easy does it. Easy...easy..."""
A worm| Hey man it’s safe in here!! You can hide in here!!  Oh, shoot man, uh ooh.
BMO| Eeeeeh!  Ooo... oh no! My face! Finn! Jake! Kiss my face!  Hmmm...  so, this is the pits.
Bubble| I hear that, friend. Do you mind if I wallow with you a bit? I'm a bubble.
BMO| Okay, nothing stopping a bubble. 
Bubble|  That's what they say.  Looks like you've given up on things. I'm thinking about giving up on things myself. I've been lost in this wilderness a long time. Maybe you and me can wait here, to get eaten by a carnivore!
BMO| No, Bubble. I know two heroes who can help you!
Bubble| You do?
BMO| Yes! Help me get to my home, and, and we will help you find your home!
Bubble| Your friends sound great!
BMO|  They are! They are huge!
Bubble| Well then, what are we waiting for?
BMO| Nothing!! 
Bubble| Hey, so tell me about your home, BMO.
BMO| I live in a tree house  it's really funny.
Bubble| Cool.
BMO| Yeah!  What about your home?
Bubble| My home? I think that my home is very large and very beautiful. But I can't pin down these memories it... haunts me. 
BMO| Oops, I wasn't listening to your story.
Bubble| What was that?
BMO| It's a carnivore waiting to eat us.
Bubble| Nooo! 
BMO| Don't worry Bubble,  I got everything under control.   It's a baby! 
Bubble|  What's a baby doing in the wilderness?
BMO| He must be lost like us! We should take him with us. Maybe we can help him find his home, too. What a handsome baby.  Handsome baby.
BMO| Bubble, what do you think our baby's name is?
Bubble|" How about ""Sparkle""?"
BMO|" No, I think he looks like a ""Ricky."""
Bubble| Hmmm.
BMO| Oo, Bubble! Ricky! Look!  I have a bad news the bridge doesn't have guard rails.
Bubble| I don't think we should cross it then.
BMO| I don't think we have any choice! I really sure there really is a carnivore this time!  Ricky, you should go first.
BMO|  You are so beautiful... and I love you. Go Ricky! 
BMO| Okay, Ricky, slow and steady,  Ricky...Ricky?
BMO & Bubble| Ricky! Sparkle! 
BMO|  Bravery!  Oh nooo-o-o-o!
BMO|  One second, sweetie! Hmm, a deadly water fall!
Bubble| BMO?
BMO| Bubble, you have to save our lives!
Bubble| Eeeeh... maybe I can, hold out this leaf. 
BMO| Thank you Bubble! I think my batteries are wet.  Good-bye 
BMO|  Oooo, good morning everyone, I didn't have any dreams.
Bubble| He looks fussy; maybe he's hungry.
BMO| My hungry baby, what am I going to do with you? 
BMO| Potato.
BMO| Eat your potato, Ricky!
BMO| It's the carnivore! Everybody! Hide!  Psst, Ricky! Please, hide!
BMO|  Oh, Ricky. Help me out here!
Mother|   My baby!
Mother| I was so worried about you, Sparkle!
Bubble| Sparkle...
BMO| No, Ricky! No, no no! No, no!
Bubble| BMO, that's his mom! Let go!
Mother|  My beautiful baby.   You should be ashamed of yourself! 
Bubble| Hey, the path ahead looks pretty clear and there were these... uh, there... BMO, are you okay?
BMO| I am sad, Bubble. I miss baby Ricky. I miss him so much already. And I miss Finn and I miss Jake. And I got dirt all in my butt circuits! And Bubble...
Bubble| Yes, BMO?
BMO| I-I don't think I'm ever going to get home again.
Bubble| Don't cry. Sparkle is safe now and we did that. Thanks to us he's going to grow up and be anything he wants to be a strapping horse whisperer or a sexy hitman or whatever. And things are looking up for us, too; I saw some bugs up ahead who look pretty with it.
Bubble| Maybe they can gives us directions or something.
BMO| Oh, my gosh! Oh oh oh! Bubble!
Bubble| What?!
BMO| I know those guys, Bubble! Those are my homeboys, my homeboys, those are my homeboys! We are close to my home!
Bubble|  Yeeah! Come on, BMO!
BMO| Yeah!!  Yeeaah!
BMO| It's been so long, I can't wait to have some bread-and-butter!
Finn|  Jake, is that you at the door?
Jake| Naw, man, I'm in the kitchen making us breakfast.
Finn| I call 'not answer the door' then.
Jake|  Alright, hang on out there I'm comin' 
BMO|  Might be a minute. 
Bubble| Um hey, so, BMO, since we have a little time, there is something I've been wanting to say.
BMO| Hm?
Bubble| I know I might never find my real home.
BMO|  No, Bubble, that's not true!
Bubble| It is, I know it is, but it's... it's okay, because I realized something, all this time we've been together, BMO, I haven't felt lost, I felt at home.
Bubble| And, it's you, BMO, I feel at home with.
Bubble| So, I thought- I mean if you feel the same way, I thought we could get married. I-I mean... I'm not even sure what that means exactly but-
BMO| I do! Oh, I do! I do!
Jake| Hey, a bubble! Pop! 
BMO| Bubble? Bubble?  No! No no no, my Bubble! No!! 
Finn| What's so funny?
Jake| Oh, it's just BMO, he's pretending to be all messed up because his bubble got popped. 
Finn| Oooh, heh haha, that is pretty funny.
BMO|  Oh, Bubble, I'm so sorry I brought you here! 
Bubble|  There, there, BMO, it's okay.
BMO|  Bubble? Is that you? I hear you in my head but I don't see you!
BMO| Oh no, have I gone bananas?!
Bubble| No, BMO, it's okay. You see, I'm finally free.
BMO| I don't understand, Bubble.
Bubble| No, not Bubble, Air. BMO I'm Air! I've been trapped in that bubble for so long I've forgotten who I am, but now I'm finally home.
BMO| Yeaay!!  Oh, b-but wait, now you don't need me... to feel... at home.
Bubble/Air| Nooo, see that's what's so great. Now we can be together forever, BMO, every minute of every day. No more privacy, no more quiet, no more alone. Every room you ever go in, I'll already be there... waiting... forever and ever, until the end of time.
BMO| Yaaaaay!! 
Finn| Tickle, tickle, tickle.
Jake| Wakey, wakey, wake.
Root Beer Guy| Wow, that was really something.
Root Beer Guy| Really something.
Root Beer Guy| Sure, I'll hold. Hello? I'd like to take a few minutes of your time to tell you about an amazing vitamin supplement. But first, just let me ask you do you ever feel that no matter what you eat, you're still tired and sluggish and... filled with nagging anxiety and doubt... and...?
Root Beer Guy's boss| Root Beer guy, get your head back in the game!
Root Beer Guy|  Hello, ma'am, I'd like to take a few minutes of your time... hello?
Chocolate Bar| What we need is to cut out the middle man.
Gumdrop Guy| Hey, Root Beer Guy
Root Beer Guy| Hey.
Gumdrop Guy| Dude, we should start our own place.
Princess Bubblegum| Next stop, Lollipop Park Estates.
Root Beer Guy| This is good. What is this?
Cherry Cream Soda| Candy...
Cherry Cream Soda|  I've got a closing argument tomorrow, Root Beer Guy.
Root Beer Guy| I knew there was trouble. I could smell it on the hot evening breeze. Fortunately for me, trouble is my favorite thing because I'm Joe Milkshake. I kicked down the door with one swift, decisive motion... No... With one swift and decisive motion, I kicked down the door... No... The door was kicked down by me swiftly with not many motions, but a whole lot of decisiveness was used by me that was apparent to everybody... oh.
Princess Bubblegum| What are you doing? Let me go! No!
Finn & Jake| Yeah.
Root Beer Guy| Hey, hey, are you awake?
Cherry Cream Soda| Not really.
Root Beer Guy| Well, this is going to sound crazy, but I think I saw Princess Bubblegum get kidnapped and the perpetrators were that Finn and Jake!
Cherry Cream Soda| Okay, sweetie, that sounds like an interesting dream.
Root Beer Guy| But it did happen.
Cherry Cream Soda| You need to eat something before you go to work. And you can't keep falling asleep at your typewriter; it's bad for your back. Besides, I miss you at night.
Root Beer Guy| I'm sorry, sweetie. I couldn't stop thinking about that weird stuff I saw last night when I was peeking through the bushes.
Cherry Cream Soda| Peeking through the bushes?! You've been warping your mind with all this mystery stuff. I swear, sometimes I think you love that novel of yours more than you love me. You've been working on it every night for ten years and for WHAT? Look at me, Root Beer Guy. I'm a Cherry Cream Soda and I have the same needs as any other Cherry Cream Soda! Or even diet cream soda.
Root Beer Guy| I didn't know what to say, but Joe Milkshake never was a talky guy. On my way to work that morning, I decided to take a second look at the crime scene.
Boss| Root Beer Guy. Root Beer Guy. Root Beer Guy, how many bottles of products you've sold this month?
Root Beer Guy| Zero?
Boss| Great, you can count to zero.
Root Beer Guy| You know, maybe if you give me the new lead...
Boss| Hmph, you haven't earned the new leads.
Chocolate Bar| It's easier to do it when you have all the leads.
Gumdrop Guy| Exactly.
Chocolate Bar| Hey, Root Beer Guy.
Gumdrop Guy| It's all about the leads.
Finn| See? I told you, it's candy stucco. Stucco feels great.
Jake| Mmm, when you're right you're right.
Root Beer Guy| Alright, you two, what were you doing last night with Princess Bubblegum?
Jake| Um, we were at home last night.
Finn| Yeah, we were doing that... thing.
Jake| That was a great thing we were doing at home with no other witnesses.
Finn| But we're each other's witnesses.
Finn & Jake| Yeah! 
Root Beer Guy| But I saw you.
Finn|  Look, man, you didn't see nothing.
Root Beer Guy| Mr. Banana Guard, you gotta arrest those guys. Come on!
Root Beer Guy| These are the guys, they're kidnappers. You have to arrest them and find out how they're hiding Princess Bubblegum.
Jake| Princess Bubblegum? She's right around the corner. Oh princess Bubblegum!  Yes?  I think some banana guards want to speak with you.
"""Princess Bubblegum"""| Where are those Banana Guards?
Banana Guards| Your highness. Greetings, your majesty.
Banana Guard| Your skin is looking lovely today.
"""Princess Bubblegum"""| I'm using this marmalade spray-on tan...
Root Beer Guy| Bingo bango. This was my lucky break.
Root Beer Guy| With one decisive motion, I kicked down the door.
"""Princess Bubblegum"""| So... being tan is my thing now...
Root Beer Guy| Quickly, I scanned the room for the... oh man. Caramel Court, Cotton Candy Prison, Lollipop Park Estates! Bingo ban...
Banana Guard| Aha! Huh?
Banana Guard| Umph.
Root Beer Guy| Bingo bango.
Cherry Cream Soda| Bonsoir, monsieur . Would you like me to turn down ze bed?
Root Beer Guy| Um, look what I got! This security tape will show that Finn and Jake kidnapped Princess Bubblegum.
Cherry Cream Soda| Finn and Jake would never do that!
Root Beer Guy| Oh, yeah? Prepare to have your mind blown! After I put this tape in the VCR just to make sure I got the right one. I'm pretty sure I did!
Root Beer Guy| Hey, yes, this is it! Bingo bango! I've gotta get to the... Are you in the tub, sweetie? I'm going out! I've gotta get this tape to the Banana Guards or the newspaper or maybe the DA or something!
Jake| Hey, Root Beer Guy.
Jake| You were not supposed to view this tape.
Root Beer Guy| But... but... how did you guys know?
Cherry Cream Soda|  I told them. That's right, I did it for us. Oh, this thing is eating you alive, Root Beer Guy!
Root Beer Guy| But it's all I've got!
Jake| Hey, this looks kinda personal.
Root Beer Guy| Mr. Pudding.
Buck Pudding| Oh, you can just call me Buck.
Root Beer Guy| Oh, Buck, those.
Buck Pudding| No need to be formal here, son.
Root Beer Guy| T-those guys were just in here, can you tell me what they bought?
Buck Pudding| Well, let's see. A shovel, a saw, some plastic bags, some duct tape, a bludgeon, a mop, rubber glove.
Root Beer Guy| Say, Mister Buck, do you know anything about this Lake Butterscotch?
Buck Pudding| A right nice spot, Lake Butterscotch. Miles from where anyone can hear a person scream... if a person was screaming for some reason. Creepy now that I think about it. Nothing up there these days but some abandoned caverns. Nice place to hide a body if you're into that sort of thing.
Buck Pudding| Son, now what are you doin' in my pickup truck?
Banana Guard| Yeah?
Root Beer Guy| Don't hang up! Uh, I'm Root Beer Guy. I'm the guy who kidnapped Princess Bubblegum! Yeah, yeah, wrapped her in a carpet, yeah, and I'm gonna dump her in Lake Butterscotch! I'm completely insane, ahahahaha, but you still have time to stop me. Get up to Lake Butterscotch right now, Banana Guard...
Root Beer Guy| Uh... and I took a boat out after 8 o' clock.
Banana Guard| Emergency! Quickly, Lake Butterscotch!
Banana Guard| Use the licorice lace lasso!
Root Beer Guy| Oh, my word. Get those guys. They're my accomplices.
Banana Guard| Oh, okay.
Another Banana Guard| I got it!
Banana Guard| Busted, you boat crimer.
Banana Guard| Finn and Jake?
Finn| Well, guys. It looks like you caught us.
Finn| Okay, Princess, you can come out now.
Root Beer Guy| Princess!
Banana Guard| Uh, yeah, it is the princess!
Princess Bubblegum| Congratulations. Whee! Whee! You were so good at solving the case.
Banana Guard| Um... what case?
Princess Bubblegum| The fake kidnapping! To test the Candy Kingdom security system.
Banana Guard| We didn't solve that case.
Princess Bubblegum| But if you weren't following the clues I left, who was?
Banana Guard| Um, Root Beer Guy!
Princess Bubblegum| Then why the jumping jay is he in handcuffs?!
Cherry Cream Soda| That was a great night , baby.
Root Beer Guy| We haven't danced like that in years!
Cherry Cream Soda| I'm so proud of you, Mr. Captain of the Banana Guards.
Jake|  ...AAAAAAAAAaaa  aaaloutte, gentille Alouette, Alouette, je te plumerai. Je te plumerai la tête! Je te plumerai la tête! Alouette,  je te plumerai!
Finn|  Huh. I guess you do know all the words. Anyway, start the next video, BMO. We gotta crack the code on the Ice King's evil secret tapes!
Finn|  Brrrr... You guys cold?
Jake|  Yeah, it's kinda chilly in here.
Ice King|   Agh... What's on those tapes...? I can kinda... make it out... Dang it, BMO, just turn to your right a little.... Ugh!! By the power of ice... I want your cup of cocoa to fall over.  Yes! Now turn and pick it up...  Yes... Yes...  That's... me?  THEY'RE WATCHING MY SECRET TAPES?!  And they're cozy. I'll show them.  This snowman looks pretty good.  Pretty darn good! 
Penguin|  Wenk.
Ice King|  Could I have five more minutes, please?
BMO|  I think I can break the code, Finn.
Finn|  Really?
BMO|  Yes. I have detected a noticeable pattern in the tears of sadness that fall from the Ice King's eyeballs.  His tears drop at an equal rate until the thirteenth tear, when the right eye drops two tears instead of one.
Finn|  Whoa...
Jake|  This is so fascinating...
BMO|"  The thirteenth letter of the alphabet is ""M."" If I print the letter ""M"" every time the Ice King says an ""M"" word, it looks like this! "
Finn|  Oh, my Glob, Jake... Is this it? Could this be the Ice King's evil secret?   WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!
Ice King|  Some of you won't survive this. You'll melt or split in half or your head will fall off... but that's fine... because you're made of snow. Only one thing matters today! Getting into that tree house, getting my tapes back, and beating up Finn and Jake!  Maybe BMO. Yeah, BMO too! Who's with me?!  Hey, why're you guys so quiet? Are you mad?  Oh, that's right. You're not alive yet. My bad.
Ice King|  Gimme my tapes back.
Finn|  No, man! I know you've got evil secrets on these, and we're gonna find 'em!
Ice King|  Snowmen! Attack!
Finn|   Crip, Jake! We gotta unravel these evil secrets at warp-crazy!
Ice King|  Good morning. You're watching the evening news. There's been an unfortunate event. Let's go talk to some witnesses.  Princess, what is your name?
Wildberry Princess|  Please! Let me go home!
Ice King|"   So, Princess ""Please-let-me-go-home,"" what was it like to experience this tragedy?"
Wildberry Princess|  What?  I... I don't... uh... um...
Ice King|  Yeah, we're on air, honey, so spit it out.
Wildberry Princess|  I... I don't know what you're talking about.
Ice King|  Obviously traumatized and in a state of shock. Let's go ask somebody else something.  Upside-down Princess, do you think things will change politically because of today's events?
Wildberry Princess|  You're really frightening me.
Ice King|  Well, there ya have it, folks. People are very upset that Gunther tried to eat Ice King's socks! Very upset! That's why Gunther has to stay in the corner! 
Finn|  Weird...  He's sneakin' in through the chimney!
Ice King|  Ah... The element of surprise... Ah, jeez, I'm filthy.  Well, now I'm cleaner, but I'm also nakeder.  Ohh! Mmm...  Just what I need...  Hehehehe...  Come on, come on!
Jake|  Yeeeesh.....
Ice King|   They wouldn't be in the fruit bowl!  Ohhh! Well, look at you with your nose shining so bright! You're so unique! Hehe! I'll name you Red-nose, and make you leader of the pack!  Eh... Well, now you look boring.  You want somethin' done right, ya gotta do it yourself. 
Ice King|  Now gimme my evil tapes back!! They're supposed to be buried!! In the ground!!  Snow goons!!
BMO|  Oh, no!
Jake|  Don't worry, BMO!
BMO|  Finn! There is one more tape!
Finn|  Play it! His evil secret must be on that tape!!
Ice King|   No, BMO, please don't play it.
Simon|  Hello. My name is Simon Petrikov. I am recording this tape so that people will know my story.
Ice King|  Oh, no! Turn it off, BMO, turn it off!!
Simon|  I was studying to be an antiquarian of ancient artifacts. Now, I never believed in the supernatural stuff myself—just had a fascination with superstitions... but everything changed when I came into contact with this item....
Finn and Jake|  The Ice King!! 
Simon|  After purchasing this crown from an old dock worker in northern Scandinavia, I brought it home and excitedly showed my fiancée Betty,  and jokingly put it on my head just for a laugh or something... and that's when it started... The visions...  I fought with them...  Shouted at them until I realized it wasn't real—it was the crown!!  I quickly took it off... and saw my fiancée in front of me...  looking at me with such contempt. What had I said? What had I done when I wore this crown? All I know is I never saw Betty again.
Simon|  Since then, I see the visions always whether or not I wear the crown. They tell me the secrets... the secrets of the ice and snow... that the power of the crown will save me with its frost. I don't yet know what this means. As you can see, my skin is beginning to turn blue. My body temperature has been lowering at a supernatural rate, to what is now about 30°C. I don't know when it will end... I'm really scared...
Simon|  I know my mind is changing... but I'm already too far gone to know what to do. I want people to know that... if I do things... if I do things that hurt anyone, please... please forgive me.
Simon|  Just watch over me until I can find a way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity!! And then maybe Betty, my princess... maybe you will love me again.  Please love me again, Betty!!
Jake|  Drrr-AMA bomb!!
Ice King|  Now you know my secret! You know... that I used to wear glasses!  Maybe kidnapping Wildberry Princess will cheer me up.
Finn|  Wait, Ice King.  BMO, eject tape, please.  Here, Ice King.
Ice King|  What's this? You're giving me... a gift.
Finn|  No... It's... well... These belong to you.
Ice King|  But it's not even my birthday! This is so exciting!  Video tapes! Heh, you know, I had a bunch of these once, but I threw them away! This is great, Finn! Thank you!
Jake|  It's from me, too.
Ice King|  Oh! I have presents for you guys, too!  Here. It's a small pine tree. I chopped it down in one foul swoop! And this  is for you!
Jake|   Uh... thanks.
Ice King|  Oh, isn't this fun?! We're giving each other presents, we're wearing silly clothes, there's snow everywhere... Let's do this every day!
Jake|  Uh...
Finn|  How about once a year?
Ice King|  Okay, that sounds good.
Shelby|  And so it was decided... that once every year when the weather got chilly, that Finn, Jake, the Ice King, BMO, Princess Bubblegum, Marceline the Vampire Queen, Cinnamon Bun, Peppermint Butler, Phil, a candy cane man, one of the gumdrop girls, Lady Rainicorn, Lumpy Space Princess, that guy, the other guy, a pig, Tree Trunks, a two-headed duck, the old crazy Tart Toter, the punch bowl, a booger, and Gunter... would get together while wearing really big sweaters and watch videos on the floor next to a fire... to celebrate the day when Finn and Jake had a fleeting moment of empathy for the biggest weirdo in Ooo. It was a miracle. Good night.
Jake| Man, birthday-holiday overlap. That's some tough luck. Everyone's all jollied-out when it's your turn for jollies.
Finn| Well... you know, it's not actually the holidays. Plus, BMO wasn't actually even born.
Jake| Well, I suppose. But you don't got to be so technical about it.
Finn| Listen, all I'm saying is we—
Finn| Hello?
Princess Bubblegum|" Hey, it's me. Is there a big rainbow over your house right now spelling out ""Happy birthday, BMO""?"
Finn| No. Actually, it's snowing like crazy.
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, that's what I was afraid of.
Princess Bubblegum| Peppermint Butler spilled grape juice on my experimental weather machine, and now it's going kablooey.
Princess Bubblegum| I got to stay here to fix this thing. Tell BMO I'm sorry I missed the party.
Finn| That's okay. BMO doesn't care any—
Finn| BMO only cares about one special guest.
BMO| Moe! Hooray! Moe is coming! And he brought me a special surprise for my birthday! Moe is the smartest man in the world.
BMO| He's way smarter than you and you and you, too, Jake—and you're the smartest guy I know.
Jake| Hey, thanks.
BMO| And he knows everything about robots. He built me, and he built himself, and all the other MOs. He's so smart! I bet he could even fix Neptr.
Neptr| What? What's wrong with me?
BMO| Oh, boy, oh, boy! He's here!  Hooray! Hooray!  Oh. You are not Moe.
MO| Why, of course I am, BMO. 
BMO| Oh, okay!
Jake| Hey, Moe! New haircut?
Finn| Whoa, Moe! What happened to your body?
MO| Oh, oh!  Oh, that old thing? She conked out on me months ago. I guess I don't make 'em like I used to.  Not like little BMO here. You got all my love and affection.
BMO| Thanks!
Jake| Well, we made a cake.
Finn| We weren't sure if you eat, but BMO insisted.
BMO| Eating helps me grow!
MO| Oh!  Well, er, uh... when in Rome.
MO| So, BMO, are you ready for your birthday surprise?
BMO| Boy, howdy!
MO| For your birthday, I got you...a special mission!
BMO|  A mission?
MO| A special mission, like a vacation.
BMO| For all of us?
MO| No, no, no. A special solo mission.
BMO| For Neptr?
MO|  No. It's a special rite of passage I designed just for you, BMO. A simple jaunt to the MO factory and back -- that's all -- and you'll be a grown-up.
BMO| Wow.
Finn| Hmm, I don't know. Sounds kind of dangerous.
Jake| Yeah, BMO's like a baby almost.
MO| Oh, don't be silly. Every other MO has done it since forever.
BMO| But won't I miss Finn and Jake?
MO| Oh, sure. But don't worry. They'll be here when you get back.
BMO| But...won't Finn and Jake miss me?
MO|  No, that's the beauty of it. I'll be BMO while you're gone. 
Neptr| Hooray! Hooray!
BMO| Hooray?
Neptr| Hooray!
BMO| Air? Are you there, Air? It's me -- BMO.  I know it's been a long time since we talked. Sorry about that. But, well, maybe if you don't want to talk, you could just listen. Moe told me if I do this thing, I'll be a grown-up, and that sounds cool, I guess.  Like, if I was grown, then I could drive to the playground all by myself.  And I could buy my own pacifiers at the store, if I was grown.  But then, if I change, will Finn and Jake still love me?  Will I still love them?  Moe changed into a new body...  and he's still the same, I guess, sort of.  But does growing up just change your body, or also your soul?  Maybe I could just stay the same forever.
Finn| So...
MO| So!
Finn| Um... Yeah, it's nice to see you, Moe.
MO| Yeah, you too.
Finn| Uh... So, Moe, do you want to... uh... Jake?
Jake|  Oh, hey, I'm on my way. One sec.
Finn| Um, hold on, Moe.  Jake, what are you doing?
Jake| Finn, all this is heck of awkward without BMO -- way more awkward than I thought it'd be. I think maybe I don't like old people. They make me feel like I'm gonna get old one day, too. I'm just gonna stay in this cup for a bit. I'll be out later. 
Finn|  You can't do that, it's rude. And what about Princess Bubblegum? She's way old, and you like her.
Jake| Yeah, but she listens to music. Moe probably only, like, listens to the sound of the earth decaying.
Finn|  Come on, you're being weird.  Hey, sorry about that, Moe.
MO| Boys, I know this is new and different. I am not BMO. But I will do the best to be your friend. This is the daybreak of our lives, and we have all the time in the world to learn about each other. For now, I will be your little robot.  Would you look at that beautiful snowfall.  Hey, let's get out there and have some fun.
Jake|  I think I'm feeling better now.
DMO| Oh, whoa! Hey! Hello there, BMO!
BMO| Hello there, DMO. I'm here on a solo birthday mission.
DMO|" Oh, yes, yes, BMO, I know all about it. Moe left special instructions for you.  He wants you to stand on that ""X"" over there."
BMO| Oh, okay.  Like this?  DMO, what happened to you?
DMO| Oh, this? It-it's nothing. It's just whatever.
BMO| Uh, I don't know about this, DMO. Something doesn't--
BMO|  Aah!  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  Whoa!  Ugh!  Hello?
MO|  Boys, look at this! This is cool, right?
MO| Oh! 
Finn| Classic!
Jake|  Yeah! Did you see what we did, Moe?
MO|  This is horseplay! Stop it!  We need to go inside and do what I want to do!
Finn| Oh. O-okay. If -- if you want.
MO|  Yeah.
BMO|" Hello? DMO? Anybody? The ""X"" door opened, and I fell through. I think something went wrong with the mission. Uh... Abort mission! Unless...maybe this is all part of Moe's plan.  It doesn't seem like it.  But maybe that's the point.  Maybe the lesson is that when you are grown, you won't ever be able to tell if everything is going totally haywire, or maybe actually everything is fine.  Huh?"
Robotic voice| Huh? Who's there? Moe?
BMO|  No. It's only me -- BMO.
Garbage cube| BMO? Oh, thank goodness. Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
BMO| Who are you? Are you a MO, too?
Garbage cube| Oh, BMO, no, no, no. I am ALLMOs.
BMO| ALLMOs? I don't understand.
ALLMO| Of course not. I'm so sorry. Let me explain.
ALLMO| Peace had reigned in Moe's wondrous factory for a hundred hundred years. There was a place for every MO, and every MO was in its place. If you wanted a free hug, all you had to do was ask. No one could say no -- it was a rule. Until one fateful day -- yesterday -- when a mysterious viral signal somehow breached our firewall and was broadcast throughout the factory... instructing all us MOs to do somersaults into the trash compactor all day long.
BMO| That's horrible.
ALLMO| And we've been trapped here all smushed together, ever since.
BMO| That's horrible, too. How -- how do we get out?
ALLMO| Well, that's why we're so glad you're here, BMO. You're the key -- the key to escape. Only you can save us now.
Finn|  Hey, Jake, what's wrong? You look dumpy. How come? Is it because of that metal box? Is something sad inside?
Jake|  No. It's nothin'.
Finn|  There's lots of boxes that have nothing in them, but also, you can put something in the box, and then it won't be empty. Does that make you feel better?
Jake|"  Ha ha. You're a charmer, Finn Human. No... it's... well... Lady Rainicorn doesn't wanna play the game Card Wars with me. I always beat 'er... so she says, ""No more Card Warring."""
Finn|  What's Card Wars?
Jake|  It's a fantasy card game that's super complicated and awesome, but—well... No, it's kinda stupid. Never mind.
Finn|  How come you never talked about it before? It sounds cool!
Jake|  Really? Well... I thought you'd say it was for nerds who do not know how life is outside of the nerd universe.
Finn|  It is, man. But I still totally wanna play it. So no more moping, okay?
Jake|  Thanks, Finn.
Jake|  Oh, hey, BMO. You wanna play, too?
BMO|  No. I do not play such games... with Jake.
Finn|  What's that mean?
Jake|  Ah, whatever. Let's play the game.
Finn|  So what kinda stakes do we play for?
Jake|  How about... the loser... is a dweeb, and the winner is a cool guy?
Finn|  Those are good stakes.
Jake|  Coffee ground, beetle butter, grape jelly, kimchi, and... this stuff. 
Finn|  Hey! You're ruining that pop with weird taste!
Jake|  We drink when the game is over.
Finn|  Oh, gross.
Jake|  Now lemme explain the rules.
Jake|  That's basically the basics! So once we have our kingdom set up...  ...it's time to start to play. FOR THE GLORY!  Hey, were you asleep?! I'll have to explain it all over again!
Finn|  Doesn't matter. Let's just play.
Jake|  But if you don't know the rules then you're gonna lose in the first couple rounds, like Lady always does! And then you'll hate the game, and then you'll hate me, and then... and then...
Finn|   You think you're gonna win? I'm gonna crush you! Party-dance-style, dweeb!
Jake|  Haha! Bring it!
Finn|  So... how do I get my land on the map?
Jake|  Oh... you, uh, floop your land cards.
Finn|  Uh...
Jake|  Keep those honeys hidden, or I'll get a strategic advantage!
Finn|  Oh!  Hmmm...
Jake|  Okay, I go first. I floop the Silo of Truth!
Finn|   Hey!!
Jake|  Pfff, you got really lame cards. Hmm. I'll take the Cerebral Bloodstorm, though.
Finn|  Huh? 
Jake|  Okay, now it's the battle phase. I'm attackin' your schoolhouse with my Husker Knights.  And I'm castin' Cerebral Bloodstorm!  So, what'll you use to defend?
Finn|  Uh... Can my Cool Dog and Ancient Scholar defeat your Husker Knights?
Jake|   Of course not!
Finn|  Hmm. Then I floop the Pig.
Jake|  What?! 
Finn|  What?
Jake|  Okay... okay, first of all, you don't floop a creature to make it fight. You activate a creature.
Finn|  Hmm. No. It says I can floop the Pig. See?
Jake|   No... He's eating all my cornfields! My Husker Knights draw energy from corn! 
Finn|  And, since I'm not actually attacking, your Cerebral Bloodstorm only does damage... to your own kingdom's troops.
Jake|   You just wiped out my entire attack!!
Finn|  What do you expect if all your power units come from corn? Pigs eat corn, dude. Cornfields stink.
Jake|  CORNFIELDS ARE AWESOME! What makes you think you know so much about Card Wars?!
Finn|  It's just logic!
Jake|  ...Your turn.
Finn|  Hmm...
Jake|  You're supposed to discard a card and pick up a new one first.
Finn|  Oh. Right.
Jake|  Look at you. You're a babe in the woods. Your beginner's luck ends this round!
Finn|  Hmm. 
Jake|  Spirit Tower?! And the Cave of Solitude?!
Finn|  Now my battle phase begins. I activate my Ancient Scholar... to begin studying.  And I also move my Pig to the Cave of Solitude so he can take a nap.
Jake|  That's it? You're not attacking?
Finn|  I'll attack on a different turn.
Jake|  HA! Then the seas have aligned and the five winds waft the smell of victory to my palace doors! I cast Field of Nightmares and activate my Legion of Earlings to scare your Pig to death!
Finn|  My Pig's in the Cave of Solitude.
Jake|  Um... I cast Teleport—to move your Pig to the empty field so I can attack 'im!
Finn|  Uh... wouldn't Teleport only work on your own creatures?
Jake|  You're right. I'm gonna slay that Pig, though!
Finn|  How? You don't have any creatures that can touch 'im!  Face it, man. I'm the cool guy.
Jake|  Hmm.  You're the cool guy, huh? Well, lemme make it a little hot for you, then.  Heh heh heh heh... I floop the Volcano!
Finn|  What?! That'll destroy your kingdom too, won't it?!
Jake|  Hmm. Maybe.
Finn|  Aah!! My Pig!!
Jake|   The Pig is dead. Now I reconstitute my cornfields using the Reclaim Landscape spell!  My Husker Knights revive! And I still have my battle phase! Hiding in the Useless Swamp... the Immortal Maize Walker!
Immortal Maize Walker|  I LOVE CORN!
Jake|  Cornfields give the Immortal Maize Walker triple damage.
Finn|  Uhh...
Jake|  I told you cornfields are awesome! Your Ancient Scholar and Cool Dog won't survive this time!
Finn|  Actually, my Ancient Scholar's been studying the Raise the Dead ability.
Jake| So what?
Finn| So, my Ancient Scholar raises the dead.  I floop the Pig.
Jake|  NOOOOO!
Finn|  Look! My Tower's doin' a thing!
Immortal Maize Walker|  HOMINY, HOMINY, HOMINY!
Jake|  YOU GANKED MY SPIRIT WALKER! AAAAGH!!! 
Finn|  Uh... Maybe we should take a break?
Jake|   Your turn.
Finn|  Huh?!
Jake|  YOU PLAY! YOU PLAY! 
Finn|   Oh, zing.
BMO|  I do not play such games... with Jake.
Finn|  Sorry! I gotta use the boy-style room!   BMO! BMO!
BMO|  BMO chop! If this were a real attack, you'd be dead.
Finn|  BMO! Jake's acting banununununus!
BMO|  Oh, no! Are you winning the game of Card Wars?
Finn|  Yeah!
BMO|  That's terrible! If Jake loses the game, he gets super depressed! When I beat him, he wouldn't talk to me for a month!
Finn|  What?! I only played so he wouldn't be bummed!
BMO|  Finn, you must take a dive.
Finn|  Okay, I'll try. But... I'm a Card Wars super Amadeus!
Jake|  Play. The. Game.
Finn|   Grob. Better make this look good.   Alright, Jake. Prepare for my ultimo attack!
Jake|  Well... I've still got my Wandering Bald Man.  Oh, no.
Finn|   I need to get rid of my Pig so Jake can reconstitute his cornfields.   I activate the Pig—to attack your Wandering Bald Man.
Jake|  Well, that's stupid. Just attack with the Immortal Maize Walker and get the game over with.
Finn|  No way! You've underestimated me and my Pig all day!
Finn|   Please lose. Please lose!
Finn|  Noooo!
Jake|  I...
Jake|  OHHH-HO! Ohhh, oh, yeah! Pigs can't leave mud landscapes once they're on them! Hahaha! The Pig is mine! First, I'll play Reclaim Landscape, then I cast Summon Archer Dan!
Finn|   Whoa. Math.
Finn|  My boys!
Jake|  You have no creatures left. That's the game, boyee!! The five winds blow through cornfields once again! For the glory of Jakoria!
Finn|  Heh. You got me.
Jake|   In yo' face! It's time to drink up! It looks like you are the dweeb and I'm the cool guy!   Is it... too gross for you, man?
Finn|  No, no. I gotta take what's coming to me.  Hey... Not that bad! I like it!
Jake|  WHAT?!
Finn|  You want a taste?
Jake|  AW, IT'S GROSS!
Finn|   In your face, dweeb!
Princess Bubblegum|  Ladies and gentlemen, I have invented time travel. This phasical sphere is flooded with info waves that scan every second, logging every molecule that passes through its volume.  I made special gloves for it.
Princess Bubblegum|  Now check it out! It's logging time.
Princess Bubblegum| I'll set the clock back now. 
Princess Bubblegum| Now I'll push the time travel button.
Jake| Eh... It's not really time travel, though. You just, you know, moved their stuff around. You didn't really manipulate time. Ice King's done it better before... with magic.
Mudscamp| Well, I enjoyed your presentation very much, Princess. Thank you for inviting me.
Princess Bubblegum| No!
Princess Bubblegum| For all intents and purposes, they traveled back to an earlier point in their time.
Jake| Eh, I guess, but not really.
Jake| I mean, Ice King did it for real. Guy pulled his fiancée out of time from a thousand years ago using magic.
Mudscamp| Hey, time, where's my fiancée? Am I right? 
Princess Bubblegum| Jake, don't deny my science. This is a time travel machine.
Lumpy Space Princess| Take me back to when my ex-boyfriend Brad still loved me! 
Princess Bubblegum| LSP...
Lumpy Space Princess| Wha?
Princess Bubblegum| LSP, that's not how it works. It can only rearrange your molecules into a previously logged formation, and you need these gloves.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Give them to me.
Princess Bubblegum| No.
Lumpy Space Princess| You witch! Give them to me now! 
Princess Bubblegum| No, I'm sorry, but you need to pull yourself to—
Lumpy Space Princess|  You skunk!  You skunk! You skunk! You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your pretty bubblegum buns!
Lumpy Space Princess| Glob! 
Princess Bubblegum| Hear me, Lumpy Space Princess, I will avoid declaring war on the entirety of Lumpy Space, ruled by your parents, if you apologize to me immediately.
Lumpy Space Princess| I'm sorry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y...  I'm sorry you're so  stupid. 
Jake & Punch Bowl| Whoa! 
Princess Bubblegum| Sheesh!
Lumpy Space Princess| Everyone in here is a loser. Nobody's as good as Brad. Oh, Brad! Why can't I get over you?
Bartender| Have you tried burning an effigy? That's what they do in movies.
Lumpy Space Princess| This isn't a movie, Charlie, it's real life! 
Bartender| Another cucumber water, Your Majesty?
Lumpy Space Princess| What?
Lumpy Space Person| Oh, I—I'm sorry for staring, but, uh, I—I know you. We used to—
Lumpy Space Princess| Everyone knows me. I'm Lumpy Space Princess.
Lumpy Space Person| No, uh, from high school. W-we were lab partners. I'm Johnnie.
Lumpy Space Princess| Ugly Johnnie?
Johnnie| Y-yeah, uh, you used to call me that quite a bit.
Lumpy Space Princess| Yeah, but I can't call you that anymore! Come on, sit up straight. Lemme see them eyes.
Johnnie| Mm.
Lumpy Space Princess| Do it.
Lumpy Space Princess| Nope. Can't call you that anymore.  So, what brings you to the Candy Kingdom, Johnnie?
Johnnie| Business, uh, actually. I own my own company, bottling and distributing Lumpy gas.
Lumpy Space Princess| Mm-hmm. 
Johnnie|" And I'm up for a big contract, uh, here in the kingdom, which could really help my business ""take off,"" so to speak."
Lumpy Space Princess| That's so cool. You're like your own boss or whatever.
Johnnie| To be honest, I'm a little nervous about this meeting tomorrow.
Lumpy Space Princess| Why, Johnnie?
Johnnie| I'm bad at talking to people.
Lumpy Space Princess| That's because you have poor posture.
Johnnie| Really?
Lumpy Space Princess| You gotta stop slouching!
Lumpy Space Princess| Now look me in the eye!
Lumpy Space Princess| Yeah, stay like that.
Johnnie| Boy, LSP, heh, you sure are making me feel good about myself.
Lumpy Space Princess| You feeling good makes me feel good, Johnnie. So... where are you staying while you're in town?
Johnnie| I'm sub-letting a friend's apartment.
Lumpy Space Princess| Talk is cheap, Johnnie. You should take me there.
Johnnie| That chair—oh, it used to be over there, but I moved it.
Lumpy Space Princess| Johnnie, it's so nice. You've really made it your own.
Johnnie| Thanks.
Lumpy Space Princess| Ooh, records!  Okay, wanna see something funny?
Johnnie| Yeah.
Lumpy Space Princess| Okay. Okay.  Sit down!
Lumpy Space Princess| Okay, are you ready?
Johnnie| Heh-heh, yeah!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Okay! 
Johnnie|  It's his face, but on your body!
Lumpy Space Princess| I know! That's the joke. My friend Melissa and I came up with that. You're smart that you get it.
Johnnie| Boy, when this evening started, I was feeling so dump trucks, but now it's like a hundred forklifts!
Lumpy Space Princess| I feel the same way, Johnnie.
Johnnie| Do you feel this couch?
Lumpy Space Princess|  What?
Johnnie| 'Cause it's where you're gonna sleep!
Johnnie| Seriously. It's getting late, and I don't want you walking home. So I insist. I'll be in the other room, sleeping peacefully... and dreaming about you.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Johnnie...
Johnnie| Thank you... for everything. 
Lumpy Space Princess| Johnnie... go to bed already. You have a big day tomorrow.
Johnnie| Good night! 
Johnnie| Rise and shine! I hope you like pancakes 'cause I got—  oh.  I guess she'll be the one who got away. 
Lumpy Space Princess| Looking for someone?
Johnnie| You're still here!
Lumpy Space Princess| 'Course I am! Now make me some breakfast! 
Lumpy Space Princess| Okay, Johnnie, good luck at your meeting. And remember, I'll be right over there,  sending you good vibes while you're wowing Princess Bubblegum.
Banana Guard| Yo, why are you so confident, man? Aren't you nervous to meet the princess?
Johnnie| Nope! My GF is back at my place sending me good vibes.
Lumpy Space Princess| Johnnie's friend has so many movie channels.
Lumpy Space Princess| Ha-ha, that movie was so dumb.  Oh, poop! Johnnie's meeting! I wonder how it went.
Lumpy Space Princess| Johnnie! Oh, Johnnie, you're home! How'd it go? Oh, don't keep me in suspense, Johnnie!
Johnnie| I did it, babe! I landed the sale!
Lumpy Space Princess| Johnnie, that's wonderful!
Johnnie| And I couldn't have done it without you.
Lumpy Space Princess| I know!
Johnnie| And here's the best part! She wants me back at the castle tonight to go over the contracts during a royal dinner.
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, my Glob! It's gonna be so nice to have dinner inside the castle. It's been a while.
Johnnie| Oh. No. It's a business meeting, not social. Just me and the princess, I'm afraid.
Lumpy Space Princess| What?! 
Johnnie| LSP?
Lumpy Space Princess| So... Bubblegum thinks she can horn in on my territory? Sip from my soup after I cut all the onions?  Yo, think again, tranch.
Mudscamp| Who—who are you talking to?
Princess Bubblegum| So how are you enjoying your time in the Candy Kingdom?
Johnnie| Oh, it's just great. I met this amazing purple girl at the Candy Tavern.
Princess Bubblegum| That's wonderful, Johnnie. Now tell me more about gas...
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, Johnnie... Ugly Johnnie, through my tender love you have metamorphed into Beautiful Johnnie Butterfly.  Every relationship, I gamble with my heart. I go all in because the payoff is true love. I see you when I close my eyes, and thinking of you makes my mind feel light. All my problems fade away, and I can't help smiling. Heh. To let someone you love go into the arms of another takes a big person. I don't know... if I can be that big.  Rah!  Eh, ehh.
Princess Bubblegum|  We're under attack! 
Johnnie| Can I help?
Princess Bubblegum| No. Hide yourself beneath the tablecloth. There's cyanide-laced gum under the table. Chew it if you hear raiders break down the door. 
Johnnie| Okay. 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Hi, Johnnie.
Johnnie|  What are you doing here?
Lumpy Space Princess| I'm going to time-travel you back to when we first met at the tavern—back to when you loved me—so we can have a second chance.
Johnnie| What?
Lumpy Space Princess| Uh!  
Princess Bubblegum| Manfried, where are the Banana Guards?
Manfried| Take a chill pill, Princess. I handled it.
Princess Bubblegum| What did you handle?
Manfried| You know. Someone drove their car in the door, but no one was driving, and it exploded, so I handled it.
Princess Bubblegum| Mmm.  Don't chew it! Don't chew it! Don't chew it! 
Lumpy Space Princess| Johnnie? C'mon. Sit up straight. Let me see them eyes. Ha-ha. Uh.
Princess Bubblegum| He's not here.
Lumpy Space Princess|  What? But I sent him back.
Princess Bubblegum| The sphere would have had to log his molecules before you engaged the time travel function.
Lumpy Space Princess| Well, then where is he?
Princess Bubblegum| I don't know.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Then if he's gone, can you send me back...?
Lumpy Space Princess| To before I met him so I won't have to remember this heartache?!
Princess Bubblegum| If that's what you want.
Lumpy Space Princess| Do it. Do it!
Lumpy Space Princess| You witch! Give them to—huh, wha? What? Where are we?
Princess Bubblegum| You asked me to use this.
Lumpy Space Princess| Don't touch me!  You pretty skunk! You don't know heartache with the whole Candy Kingdom in love with your bubblegum buns...! 
Princess Bubblegum|  
Finn|  Hurry, Lady!
Finn|   It's happening again.
Princess Bubblegum|  That's right, Finn.
Finn|  Princess!
Princess Bubblegum|  The zombie infection has spread across the kingdom once again, ...and once again, it's all my fault.
Princess Bubblegum|   I was testing a sample of the zombie flesh I had saved when Cinnamon Bun came into the lab. He said he was hungry.
Cinnamon Bun|  I'm hungry.
Princess Bubblegum|  Not now, Cinnamon Bun. I'm busy. 
Princess Bubblegum|   And that's when I made my mistake. I should have paid more attention to that poor fool.  The Candy Zombie flesh he ingested was highly contagious. 
Princess Bubblegum|  Cinnamon Bun? Where did you...  EEEEHHHHH!!!
Zombie Cinnamon Bun|  Sugar!
Princess Bubblegum|  I escaped, but I wasn't able to stop Cinnamon Bun from infecting the rest of the kingdom. The good news is I still have all my notes for making the antidote formula.
Finn|  Oh, sweet!
Princess Bubblegum|  Let's board up the windows then we can get started.
Finn|  Princess!!
Princess Bubblegum|  Don't worry, Finn. You have the notes to my formula. Just let Science do the work. Science... is... MAHHRRAHHH! 
Finn|  Nooo!!!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Get that zombie outta here!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Aw, nah! I am not getting eaten by zombies tonight.  Get the lump outta here!!! Ahh! Ahh!
Finn|  Princess!
Jake|  These notes make no sense. It's all gobbledy-gak.
Finn|  Alright, we'll each make our own version of the formula. One of us is bound to get it right.
Finn|  Hmm?
Jake|  Hey, Princess Bubblegum trained her rat to dance. Neat.
Finn|   Done.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Done!
Jake & Lady|  Done!
Finn|  Bubblegum, I'm comin' for you!!!
Finn|  Mine first.
Winged Zombies|  Sugar!
Finn|  Cram!
Starchie|  Oh, my, that's a lot of zombies down there. Starchie's glad he's up here.  Dang it!
Jake|  Let's get out of here!
Finn|  Stairs! 
Finn|  Jake, try yours and Lady's next!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Move outta the way! My formula is going to cure the zombies because I made the prettiest formula.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh. My. Glob. Look at those luscious lips. I gotta go lick up the rest of that formula! Aaaaaaah!  My formula!  Formula!  Oh, my Glob. Yes, I'm gonna be hot! So freakin' hot!  Yeah!
Finn|  LSP, look out!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Huh. I know you want this body, but you can't have it! You can't have it! 
Finn & Jake|  LSP!
Finn|  Dang it, Jake. We only got one formula left. Try yours and Lady's.
Jake|  Right.
Jake|  Let's hope this works.
Finn|  Wh-... where now?!
Jake|  We can barricade ourselves in the lab!
Finn|  Did anyone get bit?
Jake|  I think we're good. That door is made out of candy steel.
Jake|  What's the matter? 
Finn|  Jake! Did it get 'cha?
Jake|  I think I'm okay. It's just a little bite.
Lady Rainicorn|  Jake!
Jake|  It's all good, Sweetie. I can stretch forever. Hehehehe... Hey, let's hurry up with that antidote, huh, pal?  Whooa...
Finn|  Okay, let's see here...
Jake|   You should try one of them books. Over there by the lab rat.
Finn|  Ha! Yeah, okay.  Yes! This book has a glossary of symbols.
Jake|   That's great, buddy.
Finn|  Jake, I think this little guy has serious dance fever.
Jake|  Don't come near me, Sweetie!  Oh, man, I'm outta shape. I think I should just stay in here, ya know. Just in case. Ya oh.
Jake|  Hurry, dude!
Finn|  I am! Okay, Jake's probably going turn into a zombie, which is okay. I just have to figure out this formula.
Lady Rainicorn|  Jake? Jake?
Lady Rainicorn|  Jake!
Finn|  Hang on, Lady! I'll have the antidote soon, but whatever you do, just don't let him out. He may look like the Jake that once loved you, but he's just a zombie!
Lady Rainicorn|  아니야. 얘는 날 사랑해.  
Finn|  Hey, Lady... 
Finn|  The book!
Finn|   Sorry, everybody. Sorry, LSP, PB, Jake, LR, peepee poopoo doodoo.  You know, it's funny; I don't even know your name.
Finn|"  Yeah? What is it, girl?  ""Sci... ence."" Your name is ""Science""? Could it be?"
PB|  Just let Science do the work. Science... is... MAHHRRAHHH! 
Finn|  Hmm...
Finn|  Here goes nothing.
Jake|  Finn!
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|  You did it! I huh, uh... 
Finn|  Don't worry, Science. I've got a disgusting idea.  OH, MY GLOB!!!
Jake|  Sorry about biting you, sugar.
Lady Rainicorn|   난 네가 깨물어 주는 게 좋아. 
Jake|   Oh.
Princess Bubblegum|  And so the Royal Day of Apologizing has come to an end.  And now I shall present the Royal Medal for Heroic Bravery. Finn the Human.
Finn|  Yes.
Princess Bubblegum|  Would you please move out of the way?
Princess Bubblegum|  Science the Rat, you have served your kingdom well.  Citizens of Candy Kingdom, rejoice!
Citizens|  Huzzah!
Princess Bubblegum|  Rejoice!
Citizens|  Huzzah!
Princess Bubblegum|  Rejoice!
Citizens|  Huzzah! Huzzah!
Sweet P| Vroom, vroom! Kshh! Vroom, vroom, vroom!
Tree Trunks|  Sweet P!
Tree Trunks| Come and get it, Sweet P.
Sweet P| Oh boy! Breakfast porridge.  Mmm. I think I must have the most perfect life in the whole world.
Tree Trunks| Oh, that's lovely.
Sweet P| What about you, Mama? Is your life perfect?
Tree Trunks| Me?  Yes, Sweet P. I'm the happiest mama in the whole world.
Sweet P| Oh no, mama! You're sad!
Tree Trunks| No, no, sweetie. That's just something that happens when grown-ups think about their lives for too long.
Mr. Pig|  Honey, can you get that?
Mr. Pig| Thanks, sweetie.
Tree Trunks|  Hello?
Randy|  Tree Trunks? Tree Trunks, it's me, Randy. Wow, it's so great to hear your voice.
Tree Trunks|  Randy?
Randy| Forgive me for being so bold, but Tree Trunks, I must see you.
Tree Trunks| I don't think that's a very good idea, Randy.
Randy| Tree Trunks, please!
Tree Trunks| Um, okay, hold on. 
Mr. Pig| Who was that, sweetie?
Tree Trunks| That was, uh, the school. There's a parent-teacher conference I need to go to.
Mr. Pig| Really? Isn't it my turn this time?
Tree Trunks| No, because, um... it's my turn...?
Mr. Pig| Well, if you say so.
Tree Trunks| Be back soon.
Mr. Pig|  Okay. Uh, bye.
Tree Trunks| The future's wild.
Randy| We did it, babe. We finally graduated high school.
Tree Trunks| Yes, Randy, we did.
Cookie|  Tree Trunks, would you sign my yearbook?
Tree Trunks| I sure will, Cookie. Do you want me to sign on my fencing photo, my Homecoming Queen photo, my horseback riding club photo-
Cookie|  Would you sign your swim team photo?
Tree Trunks| Yes. That's my favorite. 
Randy| When you get done with that kid stuff, let me know. I got grown-up stuff to discuss.
Tree Trunks| I was about to say the same thing to you.  Randy, I've decided to take some time for myself and see the world. I'm eighteen and I need adventure, Randy. I need-  What?
Randy| Baby...
Randy| ...let me be your adventure.
Tree Trunks| Okay, why not?
Randy's father| Kiss her, son!
Randy| Our wedding photos are here. Just in time for the honeymoon. Babe?
Tree Trunks|  It's over, Randy. I'm a wild child.  Goodbye.
Tree Trunks|" ""Goodbye, Randy."" "
Randy| Okay.
Tree Trunks| Hmm? Oh, Randy, I'm so sorry you went to all this trouble.
Randy| Huh?
Tree Trunks| I mean, I'm flattered, but I have a family now and I can't run away with you.
Randy| That... Tree Trunks, that's not why I asked you here.
Tree Trunks| It's not?
Randy| No. I just wanted to ask you for my grandmother's ring back.
Tree Trunks| Oh.
Randy| I'm going to propose to my girlfriend this weekend. I've got the chocolates, and the flowers, but I need that ring.
Tree Trunks| Well, I'm sorry, but I threw that ring down a bottomless pit.
Randy| Oh no!
Tree Trunks| No, wait, that's not right. I used that ring to propose to my second husband, Danny.
Randy| Oh, no.
Tree Trunks|  Oh, Danny.
Tree Trunks|  At sea, I made a new life for myself.
Tree Trunks| Mr. Faidutti.
Mr. Faidutti| Yes, Captain Tree Trunks.
Tree Trunks| Mr. Faidutti, pick up that mop, you bug.
Tree Trunks|  Mm hmm.
Crew member| Captain Tree Trunks, we're approaching a ship off the port bow!
Tree Trunks| Good.  Drown all but the tightest men.
Danny|  No!
Tree Trunks| Impudence.
Danny| I beg of you, madam, while I am tight, my brother is not, and yet I love him.
Tree Trunks| Hmm.
Danny| My name is Daniel Prince and this is my brother, Peanut. Please look into your heart and pity him, for though our family is quite wealthy, he has had a difficult life.  You are a very beautiful elephant, but I fear your bandit ways have made you hard.
Tree Trunks|  He was right. I left my post that very day so that I could spend the rest of my life with Danny.
Tree Trunks|  That evening, we were wed.
Tree Trunks| Peanut?
Danny|  Kiss my mouth, baby!
Tree Trunks| Yeah!
Tree Trunks|  My joy, however, would be short-lived. Was Danny smooth? Yes.  Was Danny tight? Yes.  But was he a liar? Yes, yes, yes! 
Crew members| Ah!  Woop woop woop woop woop.
Tree Trunks|  A liar in cahoots with Mr. Faidutti to get me away from my ship.
Tree Trunks|  I marooned Danny, and I kaboomed Mr. Faidutti.
Tree Trunks| No more tight men.
Tree Trunks| That Danny was really, really, really something.
Randy| Okay, I get it. But what about the ring? What happened next?
Tree Trunks| I savvily invested my pirate treasure and became a powerful shipping magnate.
Tree Trunks| Come in.
Wyatt|" Uh, I'm Wyatt, your new secretary. These flowers are from ""Robot Body Moe""."
Tree Trunks| Oh, again? Throw those in the trash.
Wyatt| Okay, ma'am.  They're a little - a little big. Oh, boy.
Tree Trunks| The other way, like a vase.
Tree Trunks|  He melted my heart.
Wyatt| Hey-hey!
King of Ooo| Somebody kiss me now!
Tree Trunks|  I sold the company and gave all my money to the King of Ooo.
Tree Trunks| Swim with me, Wyatt, you sweet boy. 
Wyatt| Oh, uh-
Tree Trunks|  I'm never wearing clothes again! 
Wyatt| I, uh, might keep my shirt on.
Tree Trunks|"  I thought Glob had told me, ""Here's someone who needs your love."" But what he really must've said was, ""Go suck an egg, Tree Trunks."""
Tree Trunks| No more pie.
Wyatt| But that's my pie.
Tree Trunks| You're draining my life away.
Wyatt|  Take care of me!
Tree Trunks| No. You've emptied me of my joie de vivre.
Wyatt|  I've got the ring! If I don't give it back, it means we're still in love!  I'm throwing it in a bottomless pit!
Randy| Wyatt threw my ring in a pit?
Tree Trunks| Yeah, sorry about that. Uh- huh?
Tree Trunks| Mr. Pig, what are you doing here?
Mr. Pig| I followed you because I was afraid that - And now I see you-
Tree Trunks| Oh, no.
Randy| I just wanted my grandma's ring back.
Tree Trunks| And I just didn't want you to worry over nothing.
Mr. Pig| R-Really? Oh, geez.
Wyatt| There you are!  How could you, Tree Trunks?
Tree Trunks| Wyatt? You've been following me?
Wyatt| You wish, babe. I've been following him  to you! But if Tree Trunks is gonna be stepping out on her man with one of her exes, it's gonna be me!  Tree Trunks, help me. I need you.
Randy|  My ring! Just give me...
Wyatt| My suck-suck ring.
Randy| Aha! Gotcha! 
Mr. Pig| Um, I'm sorry I didn't trust you. I just know you've had a lot of adventures in the past and things are kind of boring now.
Tree Trunks| It's true. I sometimes miss those wild times, but back then, I couldn't even tell the difference between a good adventure and a bad one. I was just a leaf in the wind, blown about by my whims. But now I'm on solid ground. You and Sweet P are my - uh-
Mr. Pig| Your greatest adventure?
Tree Trunks| Yeah.
Danny| Whoa, what the..? Is that Wyatt? Tree Trunks?
Danny| What the heck is going on in here?
Pen|  Jake! Jake! Good mornin'! Whatcha doin', buddy?
Jake|  Meditating.
Pen|  What are you meditating about, dude?
Jake|  Wait, dude. I'm connecting to the internet with my mind.
Pen|  Ha ha! Beep boop boop boop beep boop.
Jake|  Check it out—I downloaded a little dance. 
Pen|  Huh, I like it. Yeeoow! 
Pen|  Whoa! Algebraic!
Jake|  Look! It's Princess Bubblegum's rainicorn! She looked like she was crying.
Pen|  Well, let's go cheer her up. To the max!
Jake|  Yeah! Yeah, let's do it!
Pen|  Woo hoo!
Jake|   Rrrrroar!
Lady Rainicorn|  
Pen|  Hey! What's wrong!?
Lady Rainicorn|  
Pen|  Wanna hear a funny joke!?
Lady Rainicorn|  
Pen|  Knock-knock!
Lady Rainicorn|  
Pen|  Who's there?
Lady Rainicorn|  
Pen|  Woowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoowoo, who?
Lady Rainicorn|  
Pen|  Man, that wasn't very funny.
Jake|  She's flying into the Ice Kingdom.
Pen|  Aw, the Ice King is an oxymoron.
Jake|  Seriously... but what are we gonna do?
Pen|  Survey the situation.
Jake|  What's up?
Pen|  The Ice King is throwing frozen lightning bolts at the Rainicorn.
Jake|   That guy is a total patoot.
Pen|  He's like 50 patoots!
Jake|  Whoa! And there's Princess Bubblegum!
Pen|   The Ice King is always stealing princesses. We're going in turbo time!  You want your booties?
Jake|  Yes, please.  Howop!  Let's do it!
Pen|  What time is it?
Pen & Jake|  Adventure time!
Pen|  Penguins!
Pen|  Mathematical!
Jake|  That was totally math!
Pen|  Rhombus! Iceclops!
Iceclops|  Did somebody say my name?
Pen|  That was close!
Jake|  Oh, my goodness!
Pen|  Let's rock and roll!
Iceclops|  
Pen|  Ice to meet you! 
Iceclops|  Hey, cut it out!
Pen|  Snow Golem!
Snow Golem|  
Pen|  Elemental!
Fire Elemental|  I'm lost. Can you direct me towards the sun?
Pen|  That way.
Fire Elemental|  What? Oh, geez, duh! Thanks.
Pen|  Snow problem! 
Fire Elemental|   Oh, real nice! How old are you?
Pen|  I'm 12 years old!
Jake|  I'm 28!
Pen|  Hey, Ice King! Stop it!
Ice King|  Heh? Stop meddling, boy! You and your magical dog can't harm me.
Pen|  He's not my dog! He's my friend! 
Jake|  Hey, how's it goin'? My name's Jake.
Lady Rainicorn|  
Pen|  Why are you always stealing ladies?
Ice King|  I'm going to make one marry me! 
Pen|  That's... stupid!
Ice King|  Your hat is stupid!
Pen|  My hat is awesome!  Where's Jake?
Jake|   Are you kidding? I play the viola too.
Lady Rainicorn|  
Jake|  You are crazy. You are so crazy.
Ice King|   Now I've got you, boy! 
Pen|  What's going on? Ab...Abraham Lincoln?
Lincoln|  Pen, your mind has been transported back in time... and to Mars.
Pen|  What?
Lincoln|  It doesn't matter, but what does matter is you need to believe in yourself.
Pen|  Never!
Princess Bubblegum|  Pen!
Pen|  Princess!
Jake|  Let's go!
Ice King|  Heh?
Pen & Princess Bubblegum|  Yay!
Ice King|  Nwah. How dare they trifle with me. They can't possibly think they can win!
Jake|  Hey, sloppy milkshake!
Ice King|  Wha?
Jake|  Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
Ice King|  Fool! Your powers are no match for my magical crown!
Ice King|   My powers! Foul and noisome whelp! You've not seen the last of my wintery fangs! I'll cleave the warmth from your bones and stop still your beating heart with my claaaaws...
Pen|  There you go, Princess. You are free.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, thank you, brave knight.
Pen|  Oh, I'm not a knight. I'm a boy.
Princess Bubblegum|  Well, then, thank you, brave boy. 
Pen|  Ha ha ha ha ha!
Jake|  Whoa, what is going on?
Pen|  Uh, nothing.
Princess Bubblegum|  
Pen|   We got to go, okay, bye, Princess. Bye.
Jake|  Go where, dude? We don't have anything to do.
Pen|  Heh, heh, yeah we do, buddy. Adventure awaits.
Jake|  I don't see any adventures going on anywhere. I think we're good to just sit here for a while and just talk about our feelings.
Pen|  Heh, uh, look! Those ninjas are stealing that Old Man's diamonds!
Old man|  Give me back my diamonds!
Pen|  Later, Princess! I have to attend to this!
Princess Bubblegum|  Fair thee well, Pen and Jake.
Pen|  Jake!
Jake|  What time is it?
Pen & Jake|  Adventure time!
Magic Man|   Hey, friend. Don't be afraid. I'm a gypsy child like you, running wild and crazy!   Hold on, wow... a falling star. Hm, it's too far though.  MAGIC! You're welcome.  Hm... oh... there... wait!  Oh, Glob.
Gob|  He's here somewhere, my brothers. Glob, can you see Magic Man on the sensor?
Glob|  Yes, Gob. Our little brother is very close.
Grob|  Hey, flip me!
Glob|  Okay. 
Grob|  I'm gonna activate the thingy that drains his magic juice. 
Magic Man|   My juice!  Not... flowing... right...! Dream on, honey! You can't catch this!  Magic, away!  then reappears falling to the ground] Whoops!
Grob|  I think I see him.
Grod|  Yes, I see him as well.
Glob|  Hey, guys?
Other heads|  What, Glob?
Glob|  ...Nothing, never mind.
Jake|  Wait, wait!  Shh, shh, shh! Shush!
Finn|  I wasn't...
Jake|  You hear that?  It was totally silent for, like, a whole second!
Finn|  Huh. Oh, yeah! Cool.
Jake|  Sometimes, we get so wrapped up battling stuff, we forget the...Ooomph!
Magic Man|    Aah!  Ooh! Waaa-zoo! 
Finn|  Hey...
Magic Man|  Shhh. 
Grob Gob Glob Grod|  Arise.  Magic Man. You caused nothing but turmoil and chaos to us on Mars. We hoped banishing you to this world would help you see alike to our Utopian supersociety. Now, tell us, what have you learned in these past two hundred years?
Jake|  Are you guys talking to me?
Glob|  You know you made life on Mars a nightmare!
Gob|  Now we must return you to Mars, where vengeance awaits thee.
Finn|  That's not-
Finn|  Magic Man! Get UP!
Magic Man|  Did it work? Is he gone?
Finn|   Hee-yup-hoop! They took my friend to Mars! Fly me there and help me save him!
Magic Man|   Oh, I'm sorry, but I can't. See?  The transfer drained me. I can probably barely float.  So, I just gotta wait till they kill your friend! See ya! 
Finn|  What do you mean, KILL?
Magic Man|  They're gonna put him on trial for my crimes! Ain't nobody gonna pardon these crimes on my head. Not even the King of Mars! And once he's dead, my magic juice will return to my body. Flowing through me like moonlight through the ghost dance.
Finn|  SQUEEZE!!!!
Magic Man|  I wish I could help. Except I don't!
Finn|  You succubutt!
Magic Man|  C'mon, let's go to my house. C'MON, LET'S GO TO MY HOUSE!! 
Finn|  How long have you had this house?
Magic Man|  Yes, that is true!
Finn|  Well, I bet there's something in here that could help me save Jake.
Magic Man|  There is, but you'll never make it work.
Finn|  What?! Where is it?
Magic Man|  I don't know! Have you seen my trash palace? 
Finn|  Yeah, what's the deal? This place is wrecked. Eeeew, ew! What am I stepping in??
Magic Man|  That's where I blow my nose all day!
Finn|  Ugh!
Magic Man|  Yes, welcome to my tower of light! Everyone is welcome to share this magic kingdom. Squirrels, black mold, worms, poison ivy... tiny manticore!
Tiny Manticore|   Help me, you coward!
Finn|  Magic Man, what is your deal for real?
Magic Man|  You tell me.
Finn|  Well, for one, I think this house is a reflection of your sick brain.  Look at this. Yuk. Who's this you're standing with in this picture?
Magic Man|   Memories drift in and out of my mind...
Finn|  ...all right.  Well, I'm gonna keep digging through this stuff til
Magic Man|  It's downstairs.
Finn|  What?
Magic Man|  My special thing.  Whoa! Aaaaagh!
Finn|  Holy crepes.
Magic Man|  Aah!  Tada! C'mon.  That's the thing. My special thing.  A Martian transporter.
Finn|  This can take me to Mars?!
Magic Man|  Yeah. My brothers gave it to me when they banished me to earth. They thought I'd learn love and use it to go back home.
Finn|  How does it work?
Magic Man|  You put your hands on those thingies and think stuff about people.  But it's broken! Hasn't worked in 200 years.
Finn|  But... It has to work. It has to.  For Jake. 
Magic Man|  Huzzah??
Finn|  YAAAH!  WHOOOOOOAAA!!! 
Gob|  Citizens of Mars, King of Mars...  Today the most notorious fiend in Martian history stands before us—Magic Man.
Finn|   Stop! 
Gob|  Turn on the dark.  Okay, so we don't have footage of these crimes. But Grod's pretty good at drawing, so... Plague of shadows. Magic Man brought our shadows to life. They attacked us, and ravaged Mars. Very impressive, Grod.
Grod|  Thanks bro.
Gob|  To the plague of the oneness. As we gathered to hold hands and sing our community song, Magic Man cast an evil spell that made our arms grow together. Much suffering ensued. And what about that one time when he turned all the water into hair, and we all got so thirsty we drank it? And when we drank it, we went bald! Many of us did not recover and to this day, hide our losses behind groovy headgear.  Dark off please. 
Abe Lincoln|  Magic Man, it bums me out to see this. I remember when you were really cool, before that night you spent on Olympus Mons with Margles.
Finn|   Aw, man.  Force field.
Abe Lincoln|  What happened, Magic? Why did you go crazy? If you had just learned to care about living things again, you could have come back whenever you wanted!
Jake|   Well, you guys are missing some important details. I'm Jake the Dog! Listen!  Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!
Abe Lincoln|  You sad Magic Man. Instead, you bummed around Ooo, acting like a jerk for 200 years.
Jake|  Yeah, that's true, except I'm not Magic Man!
Abe Lincoln|  Now! Ready the Wand of Disbursement!
Grob Gob Glob Grod|  Ready.
Abe Lincoln|  Space Dome, open!
Finn|  Oh snap. 
Abe Lincoln|  Magic Man, I give you two choices. One is total annihilation. The wand will touch you, and your soul will meet with Death. The second is to use the power of the wand to convert your body to living stardust, where your consciousness will be jettisoned into the infinite cosmos, on an endless journey of wonder and DISCOVERYYYYYY!!!!!
Jake|  Whoa. That second one sounds pretty cool. I mean, yeah. I'm way into that. Except...oh...I would really miss my best friend. His name is Finn, and I think it would mess him up if I wasn't around.
Abe Lincoln|  Wait. Did you say you would miss someone?
Jake|  Yeah.
Abe Lincoln|  And that someone would miss you?
Finn|  Yeah that's ME, you dishrags! 
Magic Man|  I win again, just like always!
Finn|   Jakey! No!
Gob|   Look!
Grob|  It's the dog!
Grod|  The one you were prophesied to meet!
Finn|  I don't care none for that mess. This wouldn't have globbed if you'd just...listened to my bro! You bunked up, King of Mars! The wisest, most honest super being of all time just put an innocent dog to deads!
Abe Lincoln| You're right, Finn the Human. My judgement was less than the standard by which I judge my peers. Of which I have none. I will retrieve your friend from the 37th Dead World.  Death.
Death|  King of Mars. What's your business?
Abe Lincoln|  I need this one back. 
Death|  What will you give me for him?
Death|   Not this time, your majesty.
Abe Lincoln|  In that case, I offer my immortality.
Death|  Deal. 
Jake|    Huh? Hey, I'm alive!
Finn|  Yay! King of Mars saved you!
Grob Gob Glob Grod|  Yes, but at what cost?
Finn|  Oh, man. Should we go get Magic Man?
Grob Gob Glob Grod|  No. I lost a friend. I cannot lose my brother, as well. Hey! What? Where did he go??
Finn|   EAT MY SKIDS!  YAAAAH!
Magic Man|   Oh, Margles.
Finn|  MAGIC MAN! 
Tiny Manticore|  You fat coward! 
Finn|  Go! Get out of here, tiny manticore!
Tiny Manticore|  Whatevs. I didn't need your pity help!
Finn|  Jeez. What?
Tiny Manticore|  I am the true coward. Hiding from sincere expressions like a vampire in the nude who hides from the light. Thank you, brave hero. I was freed from bottle jail, but my new prison...is shame. MY NEW PRISON IS SHAAAAME!!!
Finn|  What's he saying?
Jake|   He said his new prison is shame.
Jake| Nice. Little bird family on vacay. Dad's got the mad beautiful tail feathers; Mommy's taking up the rear all plain-jane styles.  Hehe. Glad I get to date a beautiful rainicorn, not some nasty bird. 
Bird| Hey! Don't be talking trash! Our ladies are beautiful on the inside, you creep.
Jake| All lady birds around the whole world are beautiful on the inside?
Bird| Yes.
Jake| Fair enough.
Bird| Special delivery for Jake the Dog.
Jake| Cool, thanks.  Urgent.
Jake| Hold still, BMO.
BMO| Ouch. I hurt my butt sledding.
Jake| Aw dang. Sorry, BMO.  Cool, man, I'm excited!
Jake|  What the heck am I looking at?
Jake|  Jake Jr.?! What's going on here?
Kidnapper| Jake the Dog, we have your daughter. She is safe—for now.
Jake|   What do you want from me?!
Kidnapper| We need you to reassemble your old team—Gareth, a.k.a. The Lady Master, the Flying Lettuce Brothers, notorious con-men impressionists and your old friend, Tiffany.
Jake|  Glob it.
Kidnapper| You'll need them to break in the Royal Candy Vault and steal this.
Jake| The Baker's Shard—the purest source of sugar in the known regions.
Kidnapper| You're the only master thief with the skills to swipe it. You have until midnight to make the drop. Tell anyone and Jake Jr. gets it. 
Jake|  BMO, destroy the tape.
Jake| Are we on the level, BMO?
BMO| I ain't no clown-town snitch, baby.
Jake| I don't want Finn hearing about this.
BMO| Alright.
Lollipop girl|  Oh Branard, you sure?
Gareth| Yup babe, I'm totally famous  and you love me.
Lollipop girl| Wha—what is going on? What am I feeling now?
Gareth| You are now under the spell of my face. I got you, girl, in my face trap and you love it.
Lollipop girl| I do. Branard, don't ever leave me! I'll give you everything—my fabric, my dress patterns, my marbles, my social standing— 
Gareth|  Woops! I gotta go! Laters!
Candy butler| Dine and dash? I saw that!
Tonya| Hey boss, I wanted to—
Squeeze-E-Mart boss| Shut up Tonya, I gotta see my ex-wife! 
Tonya| Uh.
Tonya|  Hello, Squeez-E-Mart.
Flying Lettuce Brothers|  Tonya, this is your boss!
Tonya| Wait, you were just here.
Flying Lettuce Brothers| Yeah, and now I'm on the phone, stupid!
Tonya| Hey, do you think I can leave early? I'm like, depressed.
Flying Lettuce Brothers| What you could do is take all the money from the register and give it to the two guys out back by the dumpster.
Tonya|  OK. Can then I go?
Flying Lettuce Brothers| Yes. 
Tonya|  Here you go dudes.
Flying Lettuce Brother| Thanks, man.
Tonya|  Peace.
Flying Lettuce Brothers| Goodbye, fair lad.  The master returns.
Tiffany| Well, well. From the shadows of dream, the dog wakes to find its—ugh——the dog wakes to find its mangy tail flopping in the dust like a fish in a tree. That fish is me! Tiffany!  I'm coming Jake, I'm coming!]
Jake|  Oh, hi guys. Were you waiting for me in the dark?
Gareth| Tiffany wouldn't let us turn them on.
Tiffany| Never mind that, the real question is what's that slo-mo Finn know about this?
Finn| Hey BMO, where's Jake?
BMO| Jake got back with his old gang and is going to rob the Candy Kingdom!
Finn|  OK, BMO.
Finn| You wanna join my primitive noise band? 
BMO| No, I like organized sound.
Finn| Pssssh! 
Jake| Nah, BMO's covering for me.
Flying Lettuce Brothers| So what's the deal, Jake?
Gareth| Yeah, why did you call us back?
Jake| I got a job for you guys.  One last score. The Big one.
Gareth| The Baker's Shard?  Are you for real, man?
Flying Lettuce Brothers|" This is crazy Jake, we always said ""Play it safe."""
Tiffany| Can't ya see guys, he's desperate! Somebody got to him 'cause he's soft now.
Jake|" What? Psssh! Tiffany! I'm the same Jake, I just stopped stealing mostly! 'Cause when you get older you're supposed to get in other stuff, like graphic design, or pottery. It's called ""growing up""!"
Gareth| I don't want to do poetry—I mean, pottery.
Jake| Dude, you guys on board or what?! You really got something better to do?! I know you don't, Tiffany!
Tiffany|  Glom you, Jake.
Flying Lettuce Brothers| How are gonna split the Baker's Shard?
Jake| We ain't keeping it.  I'm passing the shard off to a mystery dude.
Tiffany|  What the—?!
Jake| The dude has my kid.  My Little Jake Jr. 
Gareth| I'm in.
Flying Lettuce Brothers| We're in.
Tiffany| I know that vault inside and out! Every guard rotation, every camera, every deadly trap. And that safe is locked up so tight it makes me wanna spit out my guts and cry about it. Do you even have a plan, Jake?!
Jake| I have the first part.  OK, let's freakin' do this!
Private Banana Guard|  Captain, the milk delivery has arrived.
Captain Banana Guard| Well, check 'em in, Private.
Private Banana Guard| Yes, sir! 
Captain Banana Guard| And Private, I'm very thirsty! Bring me back the most delicious flavor they have!
Private Banana Guard| Yes sir! 
Captain Banana Guard| Huh? Now what in the heck—?!
Private Banana Guard| I got your milk, sir!
Captain Banana Guard| What flavor did you bring me, Private?
Flying Lettuce Brothers|  Banana, sir!
Captain Banana Guard| What?
Gareth| Banana milk! 
Captain Banana Guard|  The forbidden flavor! It's—delicious.
Flying Lettuce Brothers|  It's—it's—it's—it's—delicious!  Attention all guards! You are directed to report immediately to the courtyard for special training!
Jake|  OK, do your thing, man.
Tiffany|  Just like old times, right, Jake? When we were blood, we'd follow each other in the jaws of death on a pale horse.
Jake| Not now, Tiffany! Come on! 
Flying Lettuce Brothers|"  Tonight we'll be working on our battle ""kee-yahs."" Alright men, sound off!"
Flying Banana Guards|  Alright soldiers, time to shred those pipes! I wanna hear you scream!
Flying Banana Guard| Louder! Push it hard!
Tiffany and Jake|  
Tiffany| The Baker's Shard is on the other side of—that. The Corridor of a Thousand Deaths.
Jake| I did it! For Jake Jr.! 
Kidnapper| Stop right there.
Jake| You! Where's my daughter?!
Kidnapper| Throw me the Baker's Shard—and I'll let her go.
Jake| Yeah right, that's super-dumb.
Jake Jr.| Daddy! Please do what he says!
Jake| Hang on, sweetie! 
Flying Lettuce Brothers|  Thank you for saving me—
Tiffany, Gareth and the Flying Lettuce Brothers| —daddy! 
Jake|  You dirty—
Tiffany| Now—ugh——I'm the dog, and you're the tail! Now you chase me! You chase my dreams! 
Tiffany| Oh crud! Jake, I love you! I love youuu!
Jake| Shut it, Tiffany!  Gimme my daughter.
Jake Jr.| TADA! I totally double-crossed you!
Jake| Jake Jr.?! WHAT THE PUKE, GIRL?! 
Gareth| Let's get out of here!
Jake| What the funky fresh, honey?
Jake Jr.| I just wanted to be like you. Mom told me stories about when you did crimes.
Jake|   That was a long time ago. Before I knew it was wrong!
Jake Jr.| I thought you'll be proud of me.
Jake|   I am. I couldn't have done that when I was your age.
Jake Jr.| I age fast remember? I'm twenty-two!
Jake| R-r-r-right. I keep forgetting maths.
Jake Jr.| What are you going to do about the old crew?
Jake| Finn and I bust their apples tomorrow. Or maybe the Banana Guards will get 'em.
Jake|  Come on. I'll take you home now.
Jake Jr.|  I love you, pops.
Jake| I love you, too. Don't stinkin' do this to me again. I'm old and fat. I'll probably have a heart attack.
Jake Jr.| OK.
Jake|  Wait a minute! You're doing a long con right now, aren't you?
Jake Jr.| No.
Jake Jr.| Yes.
Jake| Now I'm really proud of you!
Finn| Huh?
Jake| I was just sipping my coffee.
Finn| Oh. 
BMO| I am also excited about today.
Jake| Oh, yeah?
BMO| Today is the first day of my new job.
Finn| What's your new job, BMO?
Jake| Yeah, are you a spy? You know, 'cause of the overcoat?
BMO| I'm a door-to-door salesman.
Finn and Jake|  Oh.
Jake| What are you selling?
BMO| I've got so many great things. Like for the man about town, this piece of lint.
Jake| I'll take it! 
BMO| Hooray, my first sale! That'll be four doubloons.
Jake| Can I pay you later?
BMO| Mm, the customer is always right!
Jake| Good attitude, BMO.
BMO| Well, gentlemen... got to chop that wood.
Finn|  It's Ice King.
Jake|  I know.
Ice King|  Oh! 
BMO|  Okay, wish me luck, fellas, even though I don't need-
Finn and Jake|  Aww.
Ice King| Boy, this is great, huh? You and me out in the fresh air? Now, the key to being a tip-top salesman is to get the ol' foot in the door.
BMO| Bodies don't talk, Ice King.
Ice King| Well, mine does.
BMO|" Okay, then. If I say ""My feet hurt,"" you can go ""Woof woof."" That's my dogs barking."
Ice King| BMO, I think we're gonna make an unbeatable team.
BMO| Yeah, yeah! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! 
Tree Trunks|"  ""Chapter 3 No Time For Sleeping. Elizabeth's heart was racing like a water mill after spring thaw. She knew her enemies were coming for her, but when? Suddenly, there was a knock at the door."""
Tree Trunks| Oh! Oh. Oh, my goodness. Someone's at the door. That's all.  Hello.
BMO| Tree Trunks, how are your children? Can you believe this weather? 
Tree Trunks| So polite. Please, please come in.
BMO|  You have a lovely home.
Tree Trunks| Here, have some apple pie.
BMO| Oh, thank you.
Tree Trunks| Now what can I do for you?
BMO| Oh, well, I'd like to show you what I'm selling today.
BMO| Okay, we have a broken branch, a half-eaten sandwich - oh, another ball of lint.
Tree Trunks| Another?
BMO| These are selling like red hots. A dust bunny - That's like a cage-free ball of lint. A doll's head, and a little velvet bag, tied tight at the top.
Tree Trunks| I'll take the branch. My loose cash is up there in the flower jar. Help yourself.
BMO|  You have a lovely home! 
Mr. Pig|  What'd you buy, honey bunch?
Tree Trunks| A branch.
Mr. Pig| Huh.  Huh? Oh. Ah, Tree Trunks, you're a financial genius.
BMO|  I can't believe we unloaded that branch. It wasn't even our best one. Oh, my. Shield my eyes from the sun.
Ice King| Why?
BMO| Because I think I see our next customer.  Those nuts could be ours. Excuse me, little boy!
BMO| How are your children?! Ice King, duck. Jump. Right. Right again.  Left. Jump, jump. Left. Right. Left. Ice King, you're doing so good. You have not bumped into anything.
Ice King| BMO, where's the customer?
BMO| Oh, no. I was so excited about you not bumping into anything, I lost the customer. Ice King, I think we are lost.
BMO| Look. A house.
Ice King| All I see is the inside of this coat.
BMO| And... stop. Knock politely.
BMO| Mysterious sentinel, you have a lovely home.  Turn.  How are your children? 
BMO| Hello.
BMO| I'm a door-to-door salesman, ma'am.
BMO|  Oh, excuse my indigestion. 
Ice King| Ouch.
BMO| I have some wonderful new products, like, uh, this ball of lint. No, wait, this is the dust bunny. Uh... Oh, oh! I know - this velvet bag.
BMO| Did I mention that it contains Finn's teeth?
Gumbald| Please, let's go in the parlor, where we can be more comfortable.
Gumbald| And you're sure these are Finn's teeth?
BMO| Yes.
Gumbald| The same Finn who serves Princess Bubblegum, obstructs my plans, and plagues my thoughts?
BMO| Yes.
Gumbald| Finn the Human's teeth?
BMO| That's a BMO guarantee.
Ice King|  Psst! Does Finn know you have his teeth? Because I don't think-
BMO|  Hey! I'm trying to close a sale here.
Gumbald| I hope you accept silver. I can pay you immediately.  Yes, my pretties.
Jake| Poor little guy. Still wearing out the shoe leather trying to make just one more lousy sale before coming home.
Finn| He'll feel better after we have a little party for him.
Jake| Still, it's tough seeing your kid get his heart set on doing something he really sucks at.
BMO| Hello, boys. Meet the salesman of the year. Or maybe of the decade. The Chinese food is on me. I mean, check out the loot. 
Finn|  It's real.
Jake| What the heck did you sell to get this silver goblet?
BMO| Just a line of smooth talk and pipe dreams. Oh, and a set of human baby teeth.
Finn| Where did you even get a set of human baby teeth?  Human baby teeth!!  BMO!
BMO| Branches and lint are moving like cray, Jake.
BMO| Oh, sure, I sold your baby teeth. I could sell any part of you.
Finn| These were, like, the only things I had left from when I was a little kid.
Jake|" Hey, you know what? We'll just go buy back those little pearly whites. I'm sure whoever bought them is like, ""Why did I buy these things?"" What possible use could some guy have for a set of human baby teeth? Unless he's an evil sorcerer or a mad scientist... He wasn't a mad scientist, was he?"
BMO| Well...
Finn|  Stay back, baby Finns. 
Finn| They're made out of some kind of hard tooth-like material. Ouch. Ouch! Ice King, freeze these nightmare babies.
Ice King| I'm not allowed to wear my crown. It's against BMO's dress code.
Jake| Just don't let them climb into your mouth!
Jake| Hey, there, bitey boys. Get off of there.  Where's your baby manners? Eek.
BMO| Hmm. Maybe I sold too well.
Ice King| Hey, you're a great salesman. Evil babies are not a problem for you. They're an opportunity.
BMO| Yeah. Where did I put those - Oh, here they are.  Gentlemen, could I interest you in a couple of sledgehammers? Perfect for smashing through minerals or composites.
Finn|  I'll take one.
Jake| Me too!
BMO| Great decision.
BMO| A little tap is all it takes.
Jake|  These baby-smashing hammers are great.
BMO| I'm sorry I caused such a mess. It's very bad for business.
Ice King| Well, time to call it a day.  The ice man leaveth.
BMO| Hey, wait. See you tomorrow, partner. 
Ice King| Until tomorrow.
Finn| Yeah, you're not doing this tomorrow.
Gumbald| Hmm. In retrospect, the attack would have worked much better were they not baby teeth. 
Princess Bubblegum| My king...  My king?  ...Wake up, husband.
Finn|  What??
Banana Guards| Long live the king!
Finn| What... is... goin' on? 
Princess Bubblegum| Hm. Not much.
Banana Guards|  Long live the king!
Finn| Huh?!?
King Worm| Wowowowowowow...
Finn| Hey... do I know you?  Hey... I know that guy!
Princess Bubblegum|  He doesn't know he's dreaming.
Finn| Huh?  Huh??
Flame Princess| Come on, honey. Eat your soup.
Finn| ...Huh...? Wait, wait, wait...
Flame Princess| EAT IT NOW!!!
Finn| Mmm... hmm... What kind of—AAAH! How... did we get here?  Uh... I'm good on the soup. Huh?  You!
Peppermint Butler|  You haven't much time, sir.
Finn|  What??
Second peppermint head| You are trapped in a dream.
Peppermint Butler| And you are in danger.  You need to find this worm and break it.
Finn| Find the worm? But... you've got 'im right there! 
Phil| Satori!
Finn| Huh? Huh? Huh?  Jake?
Lady Rainicorn|  Hold down the tape until it fully sticks to the paper.
Jake| Like this?
Lady Rainicorn| Yes, but now try holding it higher.
Jake| Like this?
Lady Rainicorn| You need more tape.  Use this.  Now, tape the bottom.
Jake| Who's it for?
Lady Rainicorn| Who's it for?
Jake| .....It's for... um...
Lady Rainicorn| Play this.
Jake|  Uh... okay.
Finn| The worm!   Worm... worm... Woyyym! Worm!!
Jake| Finn! Aw, man, is it really you?
Finn|  Jake?  Yeah. I think so.  Yep.
Jake| I'm trapped in this dream, and I can't wake up!
Finn| Me, too! I was just in some other part of the dream with Princess Bubblegum and Flame Princess.
Jake| Make-out dreams? Nice...
Finn| What?!  No, it wasn't like that!
Jake| Hey, I won't judge.
Finn| ...Lady's got two mouths...
Jake| Mm-hmm. I don't think she's real.
Finn| Weird...  Ouch! What was that for?
Jake| Just wanted to make sure you were real. Our dreams must be linked for some reason.
Finn| Whoa... Well... Pep-but told me we gotta find that worm that crawled through that hole and break it.   In my dream—  In my dream... suddenly, an unimaginably amazing sword appeared in front of me able to blast the hole open.  Rad!  I usually dream of messed-up stuff, like a shark tryina' bite off my face.
Jake| Careful! If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing'll blow apart!
Finn| Ohhh.
Jake| Just shrink down like me.
Finn| And then I shrunk down like Jake. 
Finn| How do you know so much about dreams and stuff?
Jake| 'Cuz I sleep a lot.
Finn| Heh heh. Oh, yeah.
Ice King| Fionna, Cake, I need your help!
Finn| What??
Jake| What did you say??
Ice King| I really did it this time! They're loose, and they're coming for us!
Finn| Who?
Finn & Jake| AAH!
Finn| Dad??
Jake| Help us!
Finn| Maybe he's not really... real.
Jake| Dad, are you okay?
Finn| That scarf looks... familiar...
Jake| Yeah...
Finn| Man! The worm is fast!
Jake| Yeah, it's nuts! Fast as nuts.
Finn| Well, let's catch it with...  ...some big ol' legs!
Jake| Well... that's kinda boring for me... 'cuz that's my normal power, you know?
Finn| Then you get... birds!
Finn| Ay ay ay ay ay!
Jake| Remember, this is just a dream! Keep climbing!
Finn| Now what?
Jake| Break it!
Finn| Jake, are you okay?
Jake| Yeah. Are you?
Finn| Yeah. I'm okay.
Finn & Jake| We did it!
Jake| Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Finn| Yeah, yeah, yeah! ...Hmm.  Was that... was that mirror always like that?  I'm pretty sure this is not normal.
Jake|  Nope, it's fine.
Finn| AAH!  Jake, I think we're still dreaming!
Jake| Nah, it's just dream residue. Forget about it.
Finn|  You sure know a lot about dream stuff...  You pinched me earlier, but I never pinched you.
Jake|  Everything's normal.   Everything's norrrmaaaal....
Finn| It's still a dream. Hmmm... Huh?!
King Worm| Hey, guys... 
Transparent Finn| Hey, guys!
Finn| Why're you jankin' up my dreamscape!?
King Worm|  Listen, don't worry about it.
Finn|  WHAT?!
King Worm| You can't defeat me... I'm the king worm. I'm going to keep you in this dreamscape until I've consumed... all your... 
Smaller King Worm| ...Life energy!
Finn| My life energy?! I use that! Aaagh!  Wait... something's wrong. I'm missing something.  Worm!!  Oh, man... I'm gonna be stuck here... forever.
King Worm| Ouch! Hey, guys!
Transparent Finn| Hey, guys!
King Worm| Knock it off!
Finn| Huh?
Pictured Jake| Psst. If you grunk up the dreamscape with your subconscious fears, the whole thing'll blow apart!
Finn| Hmm? Oh, yeah! Thanks, dream Jake!  GET READY TO EAT IT!
King Worm| Wowowowowowowow...
Finn| Okay, Finn... Concentrate. Deepest... gut... fears!
Finn| Oh, gross!  The ocean.  Okay... Okay, that wasn't so bad.  AAAAH!! OH, GLOB! THE LICH!!
King Worm|   Hey, why don't you sit down, or pass out or something?
Finn| NEVER!!!
Finn| Bubblegum! WAAA-HOOO!
Princess Bubblegum| Finn, shush! I'm having coffee with the Lich. You wouldn't understand. You're too young. 
Finn| SO MUCH SCREAMING!!!
Finn|  Had enough... destabilization?
King Worm| I don't...  ...know what you're talking about...
Clown| I'm a clown!
King Worm| Well, that's that.
King Worm| I don't feel so good.
Finn| GET OUT OF MY HOUSE, KING WORM!!!!!!!   Is it really you... this time?
Jake| Yeah, mans. Actual Jake.
Finn| Cool...  Pinch.
Jake| Ow, man, come on!
Finn| I'm just checkin'! ...Just checkin'.
Jake|   Blankie me. Blankie me, Finn!
Finn|  I'll get your blanket dude, where is it?
Jake|  Right here. 
Finn|  Why don't you just get it yourself?
Jake|  Because I'm sick! 
Finn|  Poor guy...
Jake|  Too hot!  URGGH!
Finn|  Oh man, Jake, is there anything I can do to make you feel better?
Jake|  Soup me, Finny.
Finn|  Soup-flavored cure coming on through. 
Finn|  Do you feel better now?
Jake|  Yes.  Tell me a story... 
Finn|  Once upon a time...
Jake|  No! I already heard that story before.
Finn|  But you've all ready heard all of my stories before.
Jake|  Make me a new one, Finn. A new story.
Finn|  Okay... got it! Once upon a time...
Jake|  Nooo! 
Finn|  What's the matter?
Jake|  I don't want a made-up story. I need a real story.
Finn|  Hmm. Now you hang on, my friend. I'll be right back.  Okay, world, give me a story for Jake!  Huh!  Jake, Jake! Check it out! This true story is going to totally cure you!
Jake|  Oh my gosh! What is it?
Finn|  First, the leaf fell off a tree. But wa-w-w-wait.
Jake|  Spit it out.
Finn|  The snail was on the leaf. The end.
Jake| Oh no, now I feel a thousand times worse. Finn, a story's gotta have excitement, romance...  ...suspense,  and it has to have a happy ending. 
Finn|  But I don't know how to make that stuff happen!
Jake|  That's okay, buddy. Just dig me a hole and -- actually, two holes. One for my guts and one for my face, 'cause when I die, my guts are gonna blow outta my face.
Finn|  I am not gonna let that happen, dude.
Jake|  Then go get me that story.  And make sure it has all the stuff on this list.
Finn|  I'll be back as fast as a can. I won't let your guts blow outta your face.  Hmm. Romance. That should be easy. 
Finn|  Hey, how 'bout you two. Are y'all in love?
Boy ant|  La ba ghee na goo da dee da?
Finn|  Uh...
Boy ant|  La na ghee ga ra la na!
Finn|  Umm.  Are y'all kissing in there?
Squirrels|  Ah!  
Finn|  Hmm. Maybe I should smooooth out my approach a bit. ♪Normal guy, forest guy. Just like normal forest guy.♪  Whoa! . Hey, so, uh, yeah... so, yeah, can I, umm... can I watch you guys kissing?
Boobafina|  What!?!
Mr. Fox|  Uh!
Finn|  I just need to for my friend! He's really sick and unless I tell him about watching you guys kissing and...
Boobafina|  What a weirdo! You're one sick man, mister...
Mr. Fox|"   Yeah, what's this ""friend's""  name, huh?"
Finn|  Jake! His name's Jake.
Mr. Fox|  Yeah, right. Sounds pretty fake. C'mon, Boobafina, let's get out of here.
Boobafina|  Yeah.
Finn|  Wait! I'll do anything! 
Mr. Fox|  Would you eat dirt?
Finn|  I would for Jake!  Okay, now you guys kiss.
Boobafina|  Man, what a freak.
Mr. Fox|  Let's go.
Finn|  What! No! Jake needs this! Stop!  Just come on!
Boobafina|  What? No!
Mr. Fox|  Ah, wait!!! 
Boobafina and Mr. Fox|  AUGGH!
Finn|   You see, no big deal.
Boobafina|  I  can't believe you made me do that! I'm secretly in love with Mr. Goose, and now he'll never love me because now I'm soiled! 
Mr. Fox|  Oh no, oh no! I really did want to kiss Boobafina! I'm secretly in love with her!
Finn|  Okay, sweet!
Mr. Fox|  No, no. It had to happen naturally! Now she'll never love me! 
Finn| Ugh!  That wasn't smooth, but it's all worth it to save Jake. Whatever it takes. Okay, a good fight...  Hey, you want to fight me?
Teenage Bear|  Oh heck yeah! I've been waiting for this my whole life! Yes! 
Momma Bear|  Oh, no you don't! 
Teenage Bear|  You never let me do anything! Grr! 
Momma Bear|  You killed him!
Teenage Bear|   Mom, quit touching me!
Momma Bear|  You killed him and now he's dead!
Finn|   He's probably not dead. I'm sorry though, that you think he's dead. Mmm, I don't want to hurt aminals, but - but Jake -  Okay, what's next?  Ohhhhhhhhhh, suspense... 
Finn|  Hey you guys, you wanna die? 
Momma Bird|  Boys! Boys! Have you seen my boys?
Finn|   No!  Awwwwww, I can't do it! I keep messing with folks, aaaaaaaahh!!!  Jake needs me, but I can't keep messing with folks, but Jake's really sick, but I can't but, but, but, but...uhhh!!!    Oww, hey, who threw -- ahhhhhhhhh!!!!  Wait, what's happening, are you guys gonna eat me?!
Momma Bear|  You'll see...
Finn|   Hey, wait, this is really suspenseful! 
Finn|  What is this?
Forest Wizard|  This is the Rite of Forest Justice!
All the animals|  Huzzah!
Forest Wizard|  Finn the human boy, for your crimes of the inhabitants of the forest... you must enter the earth and become one with the soil...
Finn|  Don't I get a trial or something?!
Forest Wizard|  No! Lower the cage!
All the animals|  Huzzah! 
Finn|  I'm totes gonna die... and now Jake won't get his story and he'll die too... because I still don't have a happy ending... huh??
All the animals|  Oo iggi, boo boo, oo iggi, boo boo, oo iggi, boo boo, oo iggi...
Finn|  Wait a minute! I may be busy dying... but you need to get busy living...
All the animals|  Huh?
Finn|  Y'all living some unhappy lives. You, Boobafina...
Boobafina|  
Finn|  You love Mr. Goose. You just need to tell him.
Mr. Goose|  What?
Finn|  She loves you... y'all just need to hook it up.
Mr. Goose|  I-I've been wanting to date you for years. You really love me?
Boobafina|  I do...
Mr. Goose|  Oh!
All the other animals|  Huzzah!
Finn|  And you Mr. Fox, you need to face facts man. Boobafina is not interested. It's time to move on.
Mr. Fox|  It's true... it's for the best.
Finn|  And hey, jerky teenage bear!
Teenage Bear|  What?
Finn|  Your mom is right. You shouldn't just go around fighting strangers in the forest.
Momma Bear|  Yeah! 
Finn|  Momma bear, your son's not a baby anymore. You should stop spanking him in the face.
Momma Bear|  He's right... It's time to let you grow up...
Finn|  Yeah! That's the stuff!
All the animals|  Huzzah!
Finn|  And Mrs. Cow, take that bag off your udder. You're beautiful, girl. You live in the forest, so why don't you just let it hang out?
Everyone except Mrs. Cow|  Ewwwwwwww!
Mr. Fox|  Yo, put that bag back on. 
All the animals|  Huzzah!
Forest Wizard|  Silence! Finn the Human, for meddling in our lives and disturbing the order of the forest...  we thank you.
Finn|  What?!
Forest Wizard|   Our lives have improved since you came here.
Finn|  Does that mean you're going to release me?
Forest Wizard|  Your cage is made of sticks, brother. Just kick it apart.
Finn|  Cool!  Yeah! I'm coming for you, Jake... with a story!!!
Jake|  And then what happened? 
Finn|  And then everyone in the forest was happy... The end.
Jake|  Huuuuuuuuh!!!
Finn|  What's wrong?!
Jake|  That was...  perfect! I feel a million times better!
Finn|  Really?
Jake|  Yeah! The romance stopped my fever... the suspense cured my headache... and everything else cured everything else! I'm not sick, I'm not sick!
Finn|  Ha ha! Neat. 
Jake|   Finn, c'mon! Dance the health dance with me.
Finn|  Nah, I'm good. 
Jake|  You allergic to my health dance?
Finn|   No, I just feel bad.
Jake|  Ohhhh... Finn, did you catch my sick?
Finn|  
Jake|  The end. 
Rag Wizard|  Faster!
Rag Wizard|  Faster! She's in danger!
Jake|  Who is he talking about?
Finn|  I have no idea.
Jake|  What?! Then why am I running so hard?
Finn|  Because...
Rag Wizard|  Because she's in trouble!
Finn and Jake|  Who is?!
Rag Wizard|  Marceline!
Finn|  Faster, Jake!
Jake|  She's in trouble! 
Jake|  Hey, wizard, how do you know Marceline?
Rag Wizard|  I'm her spirit animal.
Jake|  Oh.
Finn|  Marceline! What's wrong with her?
Rag Wizard|  She accidentally cast a sleep spell on herself, and now she's trapped in eternal slumber.
Finn|  Tell us how to break the spell.
Rag Wizard|  I'll transport you into Marceline's mind where you will walk through her memories and find the memory core.
Jake|  Then what?
Rag Wizard|  Find the memory of Marceline casting the sleep spell on herself. At your touch, you and the memory will be transported back to reality.
Jake|  But, like, if you know all this, why not just do it yourself?
Rag Wizard|  Entering a person's mind can be dangerous, and I don't have any arms. Just legs.  Yeah, there we go... oh. 
Finn|  What? What'd you do to my forehead?
Rag Wizard|  When you get close to the memory, your forehead will glow. Here, take this.  It's a sack of magic powder. Sit on the couch and sprinkle the powder on your head.
Finn|  Like this? 
Rag Wizard|  Yep, like that. Feel sleepy?
Finn and Jake|  Mmhm.
Rag Wizard|  Good. Sleep now. But know this! If you fail, Marceline will be trapped in eternal sleep... forever!
Finn and Jake|  
Rag Wizard|  And ever. And ever.
Jake|   Did it work?
Jake|  Me neither. Huh?
Jake|  Whoa. Whoa!
Finn|  So... if we're in Marceline's memories, where's Marceline?
Jake|  Hmm... there she is!  Hey, little Marcy.
Young Marceline|  Who are you guys?
Finn|  We're Finn and Jake.
Jake|  We're your friends!
Young Marceline|  Hambo is my only friend. See?  You need another eyeball surgery, pal. Lucky for you, we found a donor.  Eyeball! Nurse, hand me the string. Yes, doctor. It's our last piece. Hold still.  I'm hurting you because I love you.
Jake|  Ahem!
Young Marceline|  What are you guys still doing here?
Finn|  We're trying to wake you up.
Jake|  Do you know where your memory core is?
Young Marceline|  Nope, but there might be anything behind that cellar door, and it rhymes with memory core!
Jake|  Ooo! Ooo! Could be jams and pickles down there!   Weird. I think this door leads to a new memory; with food in it! Ooo, ice cream
Finn|  I want some! Huh? 
Jake|   Come on, Finn!
Finn|  Yo, man.
Hunson Abadeer|  Wha?
Hunson Abadeer| Marceline!
Teenage Marceline|   Daddy, why?
Finn|  It's our treehouse. This must be when Marceline lived here.
Marceline|  I'm so glad we're doing this, Ash.
Ash|  Yeah, me too. Oh, hey, wait. Watch this--I've been practicing. 
Rose|  Marceline! I love, I love.
Ash|  
Jake|  Who's this guy supposed to be?
Finn|  Ash, I guess.
Marceline|  
Finn|   This place reeks.
Jake|  Yo, man, your thing is glowing.
Finn|  My what?  Oh, my thing.
Jake|  We must be close to the core. I see another door over there. Come on.
Finn|  Wait a sec, Jake. It's that guy again.
Ash|  Hey, open your eyes, look at this, Mar-Mar. Check it out. It's my new wand.  These cherry blossoms, look, look as close as you can, and they're real.
Marceline|   Wow. Awesome. Where'd you get the money for that thing?
Ash| Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a Witch.
Marceline|  You what? Are you crazy? That was my favorite thing in the whole world!
Ash|  That's why it's so valuable, genius--for potions.
Cherry Blossom Ghost|  You're not, a genius. You're not, a genius.
Marceline|  That's the last straw, Ash! That's it! You're a psycho jerk, and you ruined my life.
Ash|  But--but not all of it!
Marceline|  IT'S OVER, YOU PSYCHO!! 
Jake| This way, Finn! Check out this whacked out memory crack! It's ba-nay-nay down here!
Finn|  The core!
Jake|  All these orbs must be her memories.
Finn|  How are we supposed to know which one to grab?
Jake|  Play hot-cold with your forehead!
Finn|  Alright.  Hot or cold?
Jake|  Cold. Definitely cold.
Jake|  Warmer. Warmer, warmer! Whoa, hot. Hot, hot, hot! That must be the one!
Finn|   Huh? Hey, you have arms.
Ash|  That's right, genius.
Jake|  Huh?
Ash|  The important thing is... Marceline's awake. 
Finn|  Marcie, Marcie! You're okay.
Marceline|  Quit touching my hair!
Finn|  You had a magic accident, and we saved you with some help from your wizard friend.
Marceline|  That's Ash.
Finn and Jake|  Ash?
Marceline|  He's not my friend; he's my boyfriend.
Finn and Jake|  What?!
Ash|  That's right, babe.
Marceline|  Ash, what's going on?
Ash|  Just picking up my girl for a night on the town; at my place.
Marceline|  That's sweet. 
Finn and Jake|  What?!
Marceline|  Oh, grow up you guys. I'm going to go freshen up.
Ash|  That's a relief.
Marceline|  Oh, Ash.
Finn|  What?
Ash|  Don't you guys get it? I outbrained you. That wasn't the memory of a sleep spell you brought me. That memory was our break-up!
Marceline|   It's over, you psycho!! 
Ash|  That's enough of that?
Jake|  Oh, no!
Finn|  What?
Ash|  Yup. Come on, Mar-Mar, let's go.
Finn|  No, Marceline!
Ash|  Ashicus Flyicus. 
Finn|  They're gone, man. He took her!
Jake|  Don't worry, Finn! I got the scent.  Ah. Follow me.
Jake|  I could smell them in there. So what's the plan?
Finn|  Um. Okay, you take that shovel and keep banging it against that shed until Ash comes out to see what's happening. Then I'll sneak in, and I'll rescue Marceline.
Jake|   Nice. 
Tiny Goblin|  My house! What's happening? No, don't hurt me!
Jake|  No, no, sorry.
Jake|  Shh, shh, wait!
Tiny Goblin|  Help, somebody help me!
Ash|   What's all this hullabaloo?!
Ash|  Hey, hold it, you, get back here! 
Marceline|  Finn? Finn, what are you doing? You can't be here! Ash doesn't like me hanging out with mere mortals.
Finn|  Yeah, okay. Sorry Marceline, I'll go. I just gotta show you something first.
Marceline|  Hello? Finn?
Finn|  Hey, there you are. 
Marceline|  Finn, what's going on? What is this place?
Finn|  It's my old house. That magic powder--it put you in my memories. Me and Jake were in yours before, but Ash tricked us into stealing your memory of you breaking up with him. But it's okay because I saw the memory. Now I have a memory of your memory in my memory. See? 
Ash|   Oh, I sold that teddy bear that you love so much. To a witch.
Marceline|  It's over, you psycho!!
Marceline|  Finn, I think I'd like to wake up now.
Finn|  You gonna be okay, Marceline?
Marceline|  Yeah. Thanks, Finn, I...
Ash|  Yo, Mar-Mar. What—What's with the chump? C'mon, I said no chumps.  Ash gets hungies at eight o' clock. You need to get back in the kitchen and make me din-ner.
Marceline|  
Ash|  I want a turkey sandwich with to-ma-to.
Ash|  Also pickles.
Ash|  Ohh...I can't see...Somebody call my mom!
BMO|  Hello?
Finn|  BMO?
Jake|  BMO?
Finn|  BMO, are you okay?
Jake|  What did you do?
BMO|  It wasn't me. I didn't do noth- do noth- do nothing. 
Finn|  Come on BMO. We got to get you to the hospital or whatevs.
BMO|  No, no. I am fine. Really.  Oh, yes. Okay. Please take me to get fixed. I need- need- need- need to get new core system drivers installed. We can get them at the MO Factory in the Bad Lands, where I was born.
Finn| The MO Factory?
BMO|  Yeah. I am programmed with emergency instructions to get there. Come on! There's no- no- no- no- no time to lo- lo- lo- lo- lose.
BMO| Okay. Now straight down this place. Okay, now take a right- right- right- right- left up here. The instructions also say that damaged MOs get a full memory-wipe before repairs. Don't let on what happened... or all the years we've been spent together will vanish like tears in the oven!
Finn| Tears in the oven?  But memories are real, real cruc'!
BMO|  Yeah, no fooling. Oh wait, there's more! It says here only MOs are allowed in the factory. Wait what? Oh, that's just great.
Jake|  Hey, hey. Don't worry buddy. We're Finn and Jake, remember? Or should I say...  Finn and JMO!
BMO|   Wow!
Finn|  Hey BMO, check this out, too!  Meet FMO.
BMO| Finn, you're dumb- you're dumb- you're dumb- you're da man! This is gonna be a snap!
Jake|  Hello, there.
DMO|  Greetings, and welcome to MO Co. I'm DMO. Please state your business.
Jake|  Hey there, DMO. I am JMO.
Finn|  And I'm FMO!
DMO|  Greetings, JMO. FMO, you look ridiculous. Are you damaged? Are you in need of repair?
Finn|  Yes, absolutely. Thanks, DMO. I busted my core system drivers, and now I need new ones.
DMO|  Fantastic. Okay. Please get ready for your total personality wipe.
Finn|  Oh, right, right. Uh, right. I mean, no. I'm just here for the... nostalgic purposes.
DMO|  Ah, yes. 47.3% of MOs eventually return to the factory for assorted sentimental biz. Please step 100% on the ultra-tram for your complimentary tour.
DMO|  Greetings. 
Finn|  Wup!
DMO|  We are now passing over the famous factory floor. Birthplace of each and every MO. Behold the gleaming machinery! Teeming and wild with the throes of real creation. From this unlikely chaos emerges every shiny new MO.
Jake|  But nothing's moving down there. It's all shut down. What happened to this place?
DMO|  I'm sorry. I'm just a tram MO. I'm not programmed to understand that question. Also, you're just a JMO. You're not programmed to ask that question.
Jake|  Uh, what question?
DMO|  That question- 
Jake|  I'm serious...
DMO|  Anyway, MO Co. was founded over 1,000 years ago. By Moseph Mastro Giovanni. A sad and gentle man. Beloved by only those he built to belove him. On your left, you'll see the core system driver installation port bay.
BMO|   Finn! Finn! That's it! That's where the driver ports are!
Finn|  I know, I heard!
DMO|  What?! Are you crazy?! Get back here!
Jake|  Hurry, Finn. I think he's calling the police or somethin'!
Finn|  None of these ports fit right! E, D, C, where's the B port?!
SMO 1|  Intruder spotted! Prepare to vaporize! Vaporize!
SMO 1|  Cease fire! No intruder spotted. Vaporization complete.
SMO 2|  Um, but what if they slipped past us, sir? In all the smoke?
SMO 1|  Allllright, everyone. About face.  Does anyone see the intruders now?  Like I said, vaporization complete. Now let's head back to base. It's donut o' clock.
SMO 3|  Man, how about those goofs? Tryin' to mess with our drivers?
SMO 4|  Yeah. You know the world these days. All goofs. 
SMO 1|  Hey! You toss me one of them 'nuts?  Ah. Yeah, hey, speaking of goofs? Haven't seen SMO 5681 lately.
SMO 3|   Man, that goof.
SMO 1|  Yeah, I hate that goof.  You ever notice goofs always askin' how you're doin'? What is that? Uh, yeah, I'm fine.
SMO 3|  Yeah, 100%.
SMO 1|  Oh! Hey, what are you doing over there by yourself?
SMO 5|  Uh, oh, I-- I'm sad.
SMO 1|  Oh, yeah, y'know we've all been there.  So anyway, how's your goofy wife doin'?
Finn|   BMO, how are you doing?
BMO|  Get me close to that guy's port. I can hack into his computer and find out where my driver port is! 
Jake|  Ah, we gotta hustle!
SMO 1|   Yeah, pretty good, I guess. I prefer something yeastier. The wife is always giving me grief about that. But I mean, what am I, decent?
SMO 4|  Hey, what are you two goofs doin'? Goofing?
Jake|  Dang, man, how deep does this place go?
Finn|  Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.  Down, right, left, down, corkscrew, down.
Finn|  Psych! 
SMO 3|  Hey, woah!
Finn|  Down that grate!
DMO|  Hey! Only MOs are allowed in the facility 1,000%!  Get off of my tram!
Jake|  Cram your tram!  Womp!
Finn|  Hang in there, BMO!
Finn|  Hey, Jake! Can this thing go any fast-
Finn|  Woah! Shoot, it's the fuzz!
DMO|  Hit 'em again!
Finn|  Holy-
Jake|  Finn, how are we getting to BMO's driver port?!
Finn|  Uh, turn right!
Finn|  Dog it, they're still behind us! 
Finn|  Turn left!
Finn|  Turn Corkscrew!
Finn|  Now go down!
Finn|  There's a driver port!
Finn|  Too spicy.
Jake|  My bod!
SMO 6|  Non-MOs are forbidden in this facility!
BMO|   I am not non-MO.
BMO|   I am BMO!
SMO 6|   BMO.
Moe|  BMO? Did I hear BMO?
Jake|  Wait, what's up?
Moe|  Hey, I'm Moe!  Don't worry! My legs don't work!
Finn|  You're Moe?! Wait, are you human, too?
Moe|  My skin is human!
Jake|  Dude, how old are you?!
Moe|  Hey, come on, now!  It is BMO! Looks like there's some software problems!  Hmm.
Finn|  So...you made BMO?
Jake|   Hey, you're not gonna reset our friend's personality, are you?
Moe|  Huh? What? No...BMO's one of a kind. I built BMO to take care of my son.  Oh, thank you. But I guess I never ended up dating any women. So, that's sad.  I sent BMO off into the world alone.  Hoping to find a family home. And then maybe even find somebody else's little boy to take care of.
Finn|  Aw.
Moe|  Oh, there's that back-up driver disk!  Thank you.   That oughta done it. I must've built what, like, a million MOs. But BMO is very, very special. I built BMO to understand fun. And how to play.  You see, I made BMO to be more. 
BMO|  Ooh! Are you my grandpoop?
Moe|  Nah, I'm just your poop.
Jake|  Wait, did you say you built a million robots?
Finn|  Yeah, all we saw was that tram jerk and all those jerky security jerks!
Moe|  Ah, those were just the surface jerks.  Up, please.  Kid, come over here.  BMO, say hello to your family.
BMO|  Hello, family.
MOs|  Hi, BMO!
Finn| Aw, yes. Storm has passed! Jake!  Jake...
Jake| Nachos?
Finn| Nachos? I love nachos...  I love nachos even more when looking out of the window! 
Finn| Hmmm, does that box have a face on it? A face... I gotta make sure.
Finn|  There's a box outside with a face on it! It might be the boxman, it's all soggy and dirty. Want to check it out?
Jake| Naaaaa... chos.
Finn|  I'm gonna check it out.
Jake| Yeah, whatever.
Finn| Hmmm, where'd your face go? 
Finn| Whoa! Okay... shhh... are you lost, little cardboard dude?
Finn| Jake! There seems to be a lost cat on the ground in a box!
Jake| Yeah that's great, get it out of here!
Finn| Hm, gettin' no help from him I guess. Do you know where your home is?
Finn| Okay, I'll follow you!
Finn| Whoa, is this your kingdom? It's wonderful!
Finn| That must be your prince.
Finn| Huh?
Finn| Huh... a prince wouldn't steal from his subjects.  Awww!
Finn| Switched?  Of course! You must be the real prince, and that thief took your place! Is that right, little prince?
Finn|  Don't worry, your majesty. I'll help you reclaim your kingdom. 
BMO|  Why do you hate cats, Jake?
Jake| Move your face, you're messing up the game. Anyway, I don't wanna talk about it, it's personal. Cats know what they did...
BMO| Is Jake okay?
Jake| Eugh... no! I'm pretty dang far from okay! There's a little shard of Tortilla chip caught between my teeth. 
Finn| First, we have to expose the traitor's deception. Ah-hah! That's a counterfeit crown, from the liar's own box flesh. Hmm... it looks like your crown was torn off by some... 
Box Prince|  Mew.
Finn| Your crown was lost, you say?
Finn| During a storm? The same storm that sent you hurling through the woods? Until you were delivered into my door step? Right... so it's definitely in the woods somewhere. All we have to do is find your crown to prove to your people that you're the real prince.
Finn|  Um... I'm gonna wait over by the gate, your highness.
BMO|  Get big, and the chip will fall out of your teeth!
Jake| You think I can stretch out of everything? You're so naïve. To live life, you need problems.
BMO| That's stupid!
Jake| If you get everything you want the minute you want it, then what's the point of livin'?
Finn| Okay, so let's retrace your steps. Do you remember which path you took? ... Prince?
Finn| Whoa, you found it already! Good work, team. 
Finn| Ow, quit that!  Come on, you're a prince.  Come, your majesty. It's time...
Finn|  People of the Box Kingdom, I have found...  your true prince!  J'accuse!
Finn| What? They... they don't believe us. The rain made your complexion look all hobo-like. They're not looking past the surface grunk.
Finn| Oh no, he's challenging you to a joust! I better find you a lance.
BMO| Did it come out?
Jake| You forgot the most important part, my impatient little friend. A thorough rinsing! 
BMO| Well?
Jake|  Bleh, nothing.  I need, like, a toothpick, or something.
BMO| I told you to buy floss.
Jake| Floss is for losers. 
Jake| Oh, one of these will do nicely.
BMO| You'll put cards in your mouth?!
Jake| Just the edge, kid, then I'll work it like a pro. Now, to find the card that best suits my devil-may-care personality.
Finn| Trial by combat shall prove which prince's true!
Finn| The joust's gone nuts!
Jake| Hey, BMO! Ta-da!
BMO|  You did it, Jake! Congratulations! How did you get the piece of tortilla chip out of your teeth?
Jake| Oh, I didn't. It's still there.  It'll be like a constant reminder of what life's all about.
BMO| ... This is unsatisfying!
Jake| ZIP IT!
Finn|  Bad! Bad princes!
Finn| Which is which...?
Finn| Awwww!  This is the one! This is your prince!
Finn|  Or maybe this is the one!
Finn| Hmmm, is this... is this even a kingdom?
Finn| Haha! Hey! Ow, you guys... aw, come on!
Starchy| Honey I'm home! Oops. I forgot I lived alone. Well, no bother. I won the Golden Shovel Award.  Candy Kingdom's premier award for grave-digging excellence. There. Now to hang up my tuxedo so it doesn't wrinkle. 
Banana Guard #1| You're missing hangers, too?
Banana Guard #2| Well, I don't really use hangers.
Banana Guard #1| Have you considered folding? We better call Princess Bubblegum.
Princess Bubblegum| And then I called you guys.
Finn| To find all the wire hangers?
Jake| Wouldn't you rather have us fighting evil demons or something?
Princess Bubblegum| Maybe an evil demon is stealing all the hangers.
Jake| Hmm.
Jake|  See anything?
Finn|  No, it's pretty quite out there.
Jake| Yeah, but not so much in here.
Finn| Huh? What does that mean?
Finn| Oh, Jake, no!
Finn| Wait, hold on.
Jake| It's over, Ice King!
Ice King| Oh, hi, guys.
Finn| What's going on? Is kidnapping hangers your new thing now?
Jake| Yeah, man, you have, like, one muumuu, and you're wearing it.
Ice King| You think this is about hangers? Really?
Finn| Well... Yeah, because you're stealing all the hangers.
Jake| You're stealing everyone's hangers, dude.
Ice King| It's about so much more! Come back to my place, and I'll explain everything.
Finn and Jake| Hmm.
Ice King| See? I dropped my keys down this deep hole. I need all these hanger guys to help me snag 'em. When I'm done, I'll return them all, and that's an ice promise.
Finn| How long has this crack been here?
Ice King| Forever. Before forever. What the...  Oh! Something's got me!
Finn| Let go of the hanger!
Ice King| Huh?
Jake| Let go!
Ice King| Oh.
Jake| This calls for an investigation.
Ice King| All right. Stand back!  Follow me, fellas!
Ice King| Watch your heads.
Ice King| Holy moly! Do you know what this extra square footage means when I decide to sell?
Finn| There's something in here.
Jake| What is it?
Finn| I don't know.
Ice King| Well, no rest for the sexy.
Jake| That's not the expression.
Ice King| Boy, this is strong. A lot stronger than my ice. 
Patience St. Pim|  Dudes!
Finn| Hello.
Patience St. Pim| What year is this?
Finn| Uh, nobody really keeps time like that.
Patience St. Pim| It worked! I mean, I feel like it worked. This is the future, right?
Finn| Who are you? You're like a beautiful Ice King.
Jake| Oh, boy, here we go.
Ice King| Back off, son! I saw her first!
Patience St. Pim|" Chill, you guys.  ""Chill""? Get it? I'm Patience St. Pim, the ICE ELEMENTAL! Whoo!  Did you see that? I made ice... with my hands."
Finn| I'm Finn the human, and this is Jake the dog.
Jake| Hello.
Patience St. Pim| Who's a good boy?
Ice King| Ahem. They call me the Ice King. I also make ice. 
Finn| He's been using his powers a lot today.
Patience St. Pim|  Hup! Well, I think you're pretty groovy. Do you wanna, wanna, wanna, wanna be my acolyte?
Ice King| Sure. What's that? Like a boyfriend?
Patience St. Pim| More like an intern.
Ice King| Oh.
Patience St. Pim| Uh, no, you're right. It is more like a boyfriend.
Ice King| Cool.
Patience St. Pim| YOU'RE COOL! Dialed in, you know?
Ice King|  Huh, what?
Patience St. Pim| Yeah. Uh, hey, this might be a weird question, but do you know where the slime, candy, and fire dudes are?
Finn| She's talking about the princesses.
Jake| I'm starting to get a weird feeling.
Ice King| Oh, you must mean Slime Princess, Princess Bubblegum, and Flame Princess.
Patience St. Pim| Princesses?
Ice King| We're like this!
Patience St. Pim| That is so fun. Okay now, this next request may sound super sketch.
Ice King| Okay.
Patience St. Pim| I need you to round them up and bring them back here. Like, even if they don't want to come. You think you could do that?
Ice King| Are you kidding? That's in my wheelhouse, right up my alley! Classic Ice King.
Patience St. Pim| So, wait, is it in your wheelhouse or up your alley?
Ice King| Classic Ice King.
Finn| Hold on a minute. You can't make Simon start kidnapping princesses again.
Jake| Yeah, he's semi-reformed.
Patience St. Pim| Excuse me for a second, boyfriend.
Finn| Okay Jake---
Ice King| Wow, you got their initials on there, and look at those shapes. We're kind of like a power couple.
Patience St. Pim| Get me those princesses.
Ice King| You got it, boss.
Finn| Jake...? Jake?  Hey, man.
Jake| Hey, dude.
Finn| You still thinking about...
Jake| Yeah.
Finn| Yeah? Me, too. Princess Bubblegum's ready for us, so we should go.
Jake| Okay. Just give me a few more months in here and I'll be ready.
Finn| It's okay, man. Just—just play it off. Just make a—a normal face.  See? Normal face.
Jake|  
Princess Bubblegum| Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming. We may begin the ceremony!
Finn| Thanks for bringing us along on the trip, Preebs.
Jake| Yeah. It's unfortunate we can't enjoy some of these cool things we're passing by, but I guess we could do that the next time we're in the Desert of Wonders, whenever that is!
Princess Bubblegum| We're on a mission to collect samples only. I want to start colonizing this area by the end of the year.
Jake| You are killing me, PB!
Princess Bubblegum| James, give a readout on fuel.
James| Right away, Princess.  Boop! Boop! Boop! Boop! Beet! We have a surplus of fuel, so after we collect samples, we may explore.
Finn & Jake| Yeah!
Jake| I'm glad James is on this trip. Hey, James, thumbs up, buddy!
Finn| Heh. Dude, James is kind of, uh, goofy.
Jake| I wasn't gonna say anything, but yeah. Maybe when we get to know him better, it'll be charming.
Princess Bubblegum| James, slow down. We're here.
James| I'm registering mondo mega rads down there. I'll ready the radiation suits upon landing.
Princess Bubblegum| Excellent. Take us down.
James| Hold on to your sack lunch!
James|  Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!
Princess Bubblegum| Okay. You guys collect as many surface samples as you can—rocks, plants, dirt, anything.
Jake| Mostly looks like it's just dirt here.
James| This'll be fun.  Jake, open up the basket. I'm gonna make a shot!
Jake| Do it!
James| Chk-chk! Whoop! 
Jake| Ha ha!  
James| Wah-wah!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hmm. 
Princess Bubblegum| Aah! Ach! Brownstadt!
Princess Bubblegum| Guys, run!
Princess Bubblegum| James, speed up that sack lunch!
James|  Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt! Vrrt!
Princess Bubblegum| Ugh! 
Finn| Ugh! Everyone okay?
Jake|  
Finn| Huh?  Oh, my garf! What are they?!
Princess Bubblegum| Uh, they're toxic creatures from another time.  Okay, let's see—suspension's all donked, navigation's lost, and the ship's legs are kaput. We're dead in the water.
James|  Chk! Ah-oogah!
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, yuck! Come on! Manners!  Gotta brain out the situation.
Princess Bubblegum| Those goo monsters will barf their way through the hull in mere minutes. Finn, what should we do?
Finn|  Uh... let's radio for help.
Princess Bubblegum| Good idea, but looks like the radio's kerplowed.
James|  I can fix that radio. Mrow-row-row! Pling!  With this! It's a lucky coin! Bam!  When I bust out my coin, great stuff happens, like when I was chosen to go on this mission with you guys! 
Jake| Mnh. Mnh. James, that's not helping!
Finn| Don't panic, baby.
Princess Bubblegum| Yes. James is very resourceful. He'll work it out.
James|  Vrrt! Veet! Vrrt! Vreet! Vrrt! Gzzzh! Jzzt! Bwr!  Look, Princess! I invented a coin-operated coin screwdrive-e-er!
Princess Bubblegum| See what I mean? Good job, James.  Come on, guys. Let's take inventory of the emergency gear.
James|  Lucky coin strikes again!
Finn| Hey, Preebos, I know things seem bad, but I'll figure out a plan.
Princess Bubblegum| I know, Finn.
Jake| Dude, I found us some flares! I saved us!
Princess Bubblegum| Right on!
James| Hey, dudes, the radio is fixed!
Jake| Good Grod! I love you, James!
Princess Bubblegum| I knew you could do it, James!
Jake| You know, James, I wasn't sure about you at first, but you're okay.
James| Thanks, Jake. I wasn't sure about you either. 
Princess Bubblegum| James, the radio's still not working! I'm not getting any signal.
Finn|  What the skunk?!
Finn| James, it's all sanched up!
James|" James is like, ""Wha?!"" It was working just a second ago, I swears! I went, like, ""Choo-choo-choo!"" and the radio was like, ""Pch-choo-whichoo-whichoo-whichoo-whichoo,"" and then I was like..."
Jake|  I take it back.  This guy's totally cuckoo! This is my cuckoo face.
Princess Bubblegum| He did his best, you guys.
Finn| Right, right. Okay, time for plan B. James, pass me them flares.
James| Chk-oo! Boop! A flare for m'liege.
Finn|  James, where are the flares?!
James| What?! May—maybe they're, uh, invisible flares.
Jake|  Finn, PB, can I speak to you in the other room, please?!
Finn| You want to do this trust-huddle style, buddy?
Jake|  Hm.
Princess Bubblegum| So what's all the hubbub?
Jake| What's up with that James dude?
Finn| Yeah. Do you think James could be breaking things on purpose?
Princess Bubblegum| No. James wouldn't do that.
Jake| Wake up. Dude's a saboteur.
Princess Bubblegum| It's not James.
James| What's not James?  I got lonely up front. I wanted to see what y'all are up to.
Finn| Hey, that gives me an idea.
James| Me, too! Vrrt!  Just kidding! I don't have any ideas.
James| Diversion.  D-d-d-d-d-d-diversion! Time to set up a diversion.
Jake| You see anything, brudda?
Finn|  Ah, I got bunkus. Wait. If we jam up to that cliff face, I think we can climb—whoop.  More goo bros.
Finn| What the—?!
Princess Bubblegum| That won't hold them for long.
Jake| It can't end like this. I got a lady and five kids! I thought I'd outlive at least one of them!
James| Here, man. Take this. 
Jake| Your lucky coin?
James| Yeah, man. It always keeps me calm.
Finn|  Who shot that flare, James?
Princess Bubblegum| We don't have time to point fingers.
Finn|  You're right. There's only one way out of this jam. One of us has to eat the big one so the others can survive.
Finn| And I'm gonna be that one. I'll run up there and get the creatures to chase me, and while they're busy noshing on my teen-boy body, you three can climb to safety. Don't try to talk me out of it. I got crystal certainty. This is what it means to be a he—
Jake| Wha—?
Princess Bubblegum|  James. We need to talk.
Princess Bubblegum| So, what do you say?
James| Sure thing, Princess!  Byong!
Finn| Ugh! Huh? Why did—Jake?
Finn| Wh—where's James? 
Finn| James! 
Finn|  Aah! James, look out! Ohh. PB! What's going on?
Princess Bubblegum| Finn, I need to explain something really heavy. I was the one who sabotaged all your escape plans. I calculated the chance of success for every possible escape plan, and none of them were going to work. You said it yourself there was only one way out. Someone was going to have to eat the big one to save the others. James did something really noble to save us.
Finn| But I wanted to do it. Why didn't you let me?
Princess Bubblegum| There's a reason. With this sample of James, I can clone a new one. He's candy, but you're not. I can't clone another you.
Finn| Whoa.
Princess Bubblegum| I made the best choice available.
Princess Bubblegum| James served the Candy Kingdom on a dangerous mission, and even though he is gone and it's super sad, I would like to honor James... with this new James I whipped up in the lab!
James' Clone| Jeet!
Princess Bubblegum| Here you go, James— an award for bravery. Let's hear it for James! 
Finn| Is this right or wrong? I can't tell.
James' Clone| Hey, cool. Did I do something cool? Do I do something cool?
Jake| I don't know, man.  Here's your coin, James.
James' Clone| Wow! This day keeps getting better and better!
Jake| Ehh.
Bird| Hello-lable!
Tuber| Cuber? Lable brother? Where are you?
Cuber| Oh, this cave air is doing wonders for my physiological... Bable, bable, bable, bable, bable...
Cuber| Oh!  Aaaaaaah! Oh! But I'm a baby! Tuber? Sister Tuber? Bable, bable, bable...
Cuber| Aaaaaaah!
Cuber| Hmm? Aah! Oh, you surprised your old pal, Cuber aboard his spaceship. Oh, this old grayble?  It's just sentimental blabling. You know, the present can be far more interesting than the past.  Let's see. Oh! It's a space wedding! Let's go in for a closer look. Easy... 
Alien groom| 내 신부를 위해 복수할 기다! 
Cuber|  Wable. Bable, bable. Bable, bable, bable.
Cuber| Oh!  Survival! Remember your training.  Trust your graybles. Oh, and you children at home, don't bother trying to guess tonight's theme. Applesauce to a theme! Your friend Cuber doesn't want to die!
BMO|  Oh, come on.
BMO|  It's Finn. Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a weather vane! Hey, Finn! I'm a cliff diver!
Finn| What?!
Finn|  BMO, you got to let me dig this hole. It's important.
BMO| A hole, you say?
Finn| Yeah. We beat this evil wizard, see, and we stole his giant wand.
Jake|  Don't listen to him, BMO. I beat the wizard, so I'm making Finn dig the hole, even though I could do it in like two seconds. Heh, heh, heh.
BMO| Rude!
Finn| This wand is crazy powerful, right? It's a thought cannon. It makes anything that you think of turn real.
BMO| Up, please.
Finn| So it's too strong, so we're burying it for safety.
Jake| I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd use that cannon and imagine a hole.
BMO| Jake, remember what they say about absolutely power.
Jake| I'm tired of your wisdom, BMO!  Now watch and learn! Yeah, okay, my name's Jake, and I'm gonna take this magic thought cannon, and I'm gonna think, I want a hole to bury this thought cannon in, and bobble, bobble, Jake gets a hole in which a thought cannon may be buried!
Finn| What if for a split second you think of something else?
Jake| Nope, my brain's my hands!
Jake| Whoops! Looks like I was thinking about a sandwich.  Enjoy your labor! Heh, heh, heh.
BMO| I used to wish I was you. Now I just wish you would dig faster.
Cuber|"  What's this, friends?  Could it be the aformabled thought cannon? ""Bobble, bobble"" as the dead might say. That's the power of graybles."
Aliens|  에잇, 누가던진거야 이거?
Aliens| 잠깐, 너 방금전...
Cuber|  I guess here goes bable.
Cuber|  You try not to think of a sandwich, and look what happens! A sandwich!
Cuber|  Ow! Mama's milk! Oh, my mama's milk! Oh, that milk! Graybles!
Alarm clock with a headshot of Princess Bubblegum taped to the minute hand|"  ""I will marry you, Ice King. I will marry you, Ice King. I will marry you—"
Ice King|   Good morning, madness.  What?! Broken leg again!  and...  Hup!  Hello! How are you?! Oh! Gunther, did you see how this happened?
Ice King| I love you, Gunther, but I'm on to your business.
Cuber| Hmm, just like that, huh? And...  Hup! 
Tuber| You can do it, Cuber.
Cuber|   
Cuber| You can do it, Cuber. You can run away.  Friend or foe, I doble know.  Now what? Maybe grayble.
Princess Bubblegum|  I see that Mr. Cupcake is at Madam Eclair's apartment again. His massage business is really taking off. Hmm.
Bubblegum| Starchy?
Starchy| Yes, sir. Starchy is just going for a walk.  Ooh! A Grass Lard! Oh, look, wildflowers! Psst, psst! Hey! 
Starchy| Well, I'm just gonna pick these flowers now.    No holes.
Starchy| Yeah, in the ear.  Oh, I mean, in the rear. That's what all the walking's good for -- gives me self-esteem to have a nice rear.
Starchy| Aah! Oh! No! Agh! Mercy from the wet eyes!
Starchy| Whoa! 
Starchy| Unh!
Bubblegum| Starchy?! Did Starchy just die?
Starchy|  Hey, hey!
Cuber| Things looking up.  Mm.  
Grass Lard| Thank you.  
Cuber| S.O.S. -- Save our skin.
Alien groom|  저놈 저깄다! 
Cuber| Aah!
Prize Ball Guardian| Welcome home, Starchy.
Cuber| Never mind! 
Cuber|  
Crunchy|  Oh, what time is it?
Cuber| Oh! Graybles!
Lady Rainicorn|  떡 많이 먹으면 이렇게 되는거지 뭐~ 
Cuber|  Well, one grayble left. 
Baby Cuber| Aah!  Tuber!
Tuber| Self-actualization, lable brother.
Tuber| You can be a hero, Cuber, and what a cube can be you must be.
Alien groom|  아따, 이 봐야될 거 같은디.  너 뒤에 있다! 
Cuber| I'm a hero!  Cuber first! 
Cuber|  Now, wasn't that a thing! We've had laffs and gaffs, thribbles and chibbles, some close calls, secrets and questions, and memories to share. We barely made it out with our scaybles... All thanks to graybles. Sister Tuber? I'm sorry for this mess. I love you.
Tuber| Psh!
Lemongrab| Commence dinner.
Lemongrab| Dinner is concluded.
Everyone else|  Concluded. 
Lemongrab| Up.
Lemon Person| Ooh!
Lemongrab| Mm. Lights out!
Lemongrab| Huh?!
Lemongrab| Bye.
Finn| Better get up here, Jake. It's about to happen.
Jake| Coming! Just gotta get this cocoa pipin'.
Finn| Your loss, man. The Dap of the Heavens only happens every 20 years.  Oh, man. It's going down.
Jake| Okay. Let's watch some stars.
Finn| Hmm. You missed it. It was honestly a little disappointing.
Jake| Oh. Okay. Hey, man, I think I hear something weird over there with my little doggy ears.
Flame Princess| Phew! You are killing, Cinnamon Bun! This routine is locked up!
Cinnamon Bun| Oh! Thank you, Princess. You are also killing.
Finn| You mean Flame Princess?
Jake| Naw, man. What I heard didn't sound like her. Give me a peek on there. This is pretty much just a tube.  Huh. It's Lemongrab.
Finn| Uh, Lemongrab?! What's he up to at this time of night?
Jake| Uh... it looks like he's headed for the Mountain of Matthew. I hear beaucoup spookoo legends about that place.
Finn| Beaucoup spookoo, you say? We should follow him.
Jake| Huh? How come you care where Lemongrab goes?
Finn| He could, you know, he could be messing with crazy mystic power at that mountain. It's like seeing a baby playing with dynamite. Plus, seeing Flame Princess kind of messed me up. Now I gotta distract myself with work.
Jake| Okay, okay. I feel you. Let's do some things. 
Finn| There's his Lemon Camel. Lemongrease must be inside already.
Jake| Whoa!
Finn| Huh? C'mon man!
Guardian of the Mountain| Nope. 
Guardian of the Mountain| Nuh uh. 
Jake| Dang it!  Quit bustin' my buns!
Guardian of the Mountain|  You have no beeswax in the Mountain of Matthew, supple yellow dog. But you, plucky adolescent, you have way cray beeswax.
Jake|  You gonna be okay by yourself?
Finn|  Yeah, man.
Jake| Okay.  Just gonna sit down over here—
Guardian of the Mountain|  Not even.
Jake|  Dong it!
Lemongrab| Rocks. Dripping water. More rocks. Oh, I'm becoming stressed!
Matthew| Continue forward.
Lemongrab| Hmm?
Matthew| To reach me, you must choose correctly.
Lemongrab| Aah!
Princess Bubblegum| Come, Earl of Lemongrab! Let us play the game of catch. I am eager to relate to you.
Lemongrab| Yes. I desire this, as well. Huh?
Lemonhope| Thank you! Thank you all! As your younger, more relatable new ruler, I shall endeavor to undo all the order imposed by my predecessor! 
Lemongrab| I unaccept!
Lemonhope| No, Lemongrab! You are unacceptable!
Lemongrab| Prepare to be served in a pitcher by a little child!
Lemongrab 2| What a wondrous time you've experienced, and tomorrow there will be more adventures to be had for little Lemonsweets.
Lemongrab 3| Ooh, wave farewell! What a lucky little boy you are to live so gaily.
Lemongrab| Lemonsweets.
Matthew| Choose.
Lemongrab| Ohh!
Princess Bubblegum| Lemongrab!  We understand your styles. We are of the same styles. 
Lemongrab 2| Eee! Aaaaaaaaaaah!
Lemongrab 3| No! It is my love that he prefers! He is spiteful of your love!
Lemongrab| Don't hurt him! Ohhh!  What?  No!   Ohhh! Aaaah! Ohhhh! I'm inside you! Aaaaah!
Lemongrab|  Mnh. Sticky.  Gross! Aww! What is this? Aaaah! Why?! Ohh! Shoosh!  Okay.  Whoa! Ohh! Whoa!  Whoa! Whoa! Oh, whoa! Gross! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!  Blackness all over! Rolling in grease! You want to humiliate me?! Whoop! 
Matthew| Taste the grease, Lemongrab.
Lemongrab| Okay. It's lemony.
Matthew| Look up, man.
Lemongrab|  Aaaaaah! I am grease?!
Finn| Lemongrab, where you at?! Uh, cool.
Matthew| To reach me, you must choose correctly.
Finn| Who's that Matthew? Whuh-oh!
Flame Princess| Yo, get up, C.B.! This routine's got to be high-level outside the box!
Cinnamon Bun| Hey, Finn, quick! Be me, bro! Be me, bro!
Jake| Oh, yeah! It's time, BMO!
BMO| What is it? I can't smell.
Jake| Finn Cakes, boy!
BMO| Yummy! Ooh.
Finn| Yo. Dang. Finn Cakes. That's not fair.
Lemongrab| Okay. Goodbye, lemongrease.
Lemongrab| Goodbye, where?
Lemongrab| Goodbye from my grease body into the blackness, where only my pure essence can go!
Jake| Up-up, BMO. Finn always gets the first Finn Cake.
BMO| Yo, give me a break.
Lemongrab| Pure essence! Eject!  Blorg! Bleject!
Finn| Lemongrab! Huh? Whoo!
Finn| Later, spirit bro.  Huh? What the heck am I running on? Oh, whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Cool.  
Finn| Lemongrab, you okay?!
Lemongrab| Finn, don't mess me up.
Matthew| Hi, Finn.
Finn|" You're Matthew, huh?  Your rep precedes you, bro. ""Proceeds""?"
Matthew| What kind of rep?
Finn| Some stuff Jake said that I interpreted as negative.
Matthew| Well, ask yourself if that feels right.
Finn|  What do you say, guy? 
Matthew| The meat bodies who've journeyed to this mountain have distilled themselves to their original source materials and  now exist in oneness.
Finn| Oneness? That's you, bro?
Matthew| I keep adding to myself until the second age of terror, when I will emerge in my final form and restore the world.
Finn| That's why you're here, L.G.? To merge with Matthew?
Lemongrab| It is one option, to know the ecstasy of my ego death.
Finn| Oh. Well, nice knowing you? I mean, I know you got issues. But you're, uh...
Lemongrab| I know.
Finn| Are you sure, though?
Lemongrab| Here's my other option. You see these? Lemonjons?
Matthew| Uh-oh.
Lemongrab| These lemonjons are me, and I wonder if they can destroy you.
Finn| Ooh, boy. Lemongrab, hold up!
Lemongrab| If you are the head that blooms atop the ziggurat, then the stairs that lead to you must be infinite!
Finn| Careful with those metaphors, bro!
Lemongrab| Infinite stairs are unacceptable!
Matthew|  Ohh. Aaaaah!
Finn| Ooh! Whoa! Whoa! Geez!
Creature|  Oh, no, bro! Heck, no, bro!
Creature 2| Aaaah!
Finn| Yo!
Creature 3| Smash that Lemongrab! 
Lemongrab| Try it, grease! 
Finn| Yes! Pow! Yeah! I got you, bro!
Jake| Why are you being so opaque about not letting me in there?
Guardian of the Mountain| Well, get out a pen and paper and I'll school you on this biz. 
Jake| Gol' ding!
Finn| Dude, I was gonna ask him to move.
Lemongrab| Oh.
Jake| Yo, class, hold on. Uh...
Lemongrab|  I'm done! Let's go!
Jake| Okay. Here we are.
Lemongrab| Bye! Aaaaaah! 
Lemongrab|   Yo, yo! It's grease!
Finn| Hmm...
Jake| Yo, man, what's going on?
Finn| I found this crystal on our door step, it's pretty mysterious, I'm trying to find information about it using the holobook.
Jake| Oo, that's cool, but do you know what's really cool? Tough Guy contest!  Whoo-hoo!  Tough Boys!
Finn|  Wait man, doesn't this look like Tree Trunks' lipstick?
Jake| That's impossible, Tree Trunks exploded in the scary dark forest after she ate that Crystal Gem Apple, remember?
Finn| Yeah, I remember. 
Jake| Come on man! Tough Guy contest me!
Finn| Ha! 
Jake|  you got what it takes to rip-it?!
Finn| Uh, yeah! 
Jake| Then let's get it on!
Finn| Yeah-yo!
Jake| Hee-yah!
Jake|  Do it, Finn, do it! 
Finn|   Noooooo!
Finn| Got you, dude!
Jake| I'm gonna break out! 
Finn| No way!
Jake|  I'm breaking out of my fat!  I win, Finn! Finn?  Finn, Finn! Are you okay?! 
Jake|  I was just messing with ya, dude.
Finn|  I... was just... messing with... you  
Jake|  Are you okay?
Finn|  Yeah,  I'm just going to rest my muscles. 
Jake| Oh dangit, Jake  you can't get all out of control like that!  Why am I like this?!  like this... like this...
Joshua|  Jake, what did you do to your brother?
Jake| We were just playin' and then I got out of control! I'm sorry, dad.
Joshua|  No, son, you did good.  Having no self control makes you a tough galoot, like me!
Jake|  But I don't want to hurt nobody!
Joshua| Well, that's too bad, kid, 'cause you're going to hurt everybody!
Jake|  Noooo!
Jake|  Whatevs', daddy!   I'm never going to hurt anybody, ever, starting... now!
Finn|  'Sup, dude?
Jake| Finn, you're okay! I was afraid I mashed your potatoes too hard last night.
Finn| Ha, you didn't mash my potatoes!  You didn't even make me cry silently into my pillow last night for- thirty minutes. In fact, you read to go again tough stuff?!
Jake| Nope, no more, dude.
Finn| What?!
Jake| I never wanna lose control again, man! I'm going totally soft 
Finn| You look like a wuss!
Jake| Mmm hmm.
Finn|   Hey, the crystal is glowing a different color! 
Jake| Whoa...
Finn| Chip-chap-chop, what's going on?!
Crystal Guardian #1| Uh, which one of you is Finn the Human?
Finn| It depends on who's asking, are ya'll good or evil?
Crystal Guardian #1| Uh, we're good.
Finn| Oh, I'm Finn
Crystal Guardian #1| Get him! 
Jake|  Hey, you guys, put my bro down.
Finn| Jake! 
Jake| Finn! 
Finn| Hey!
Jake| Hey, man, what happened?
Finn| I don't know, but I'm trapped in this crystal ball, get me out of here!
Jake| Okay, I'll try to do it using 'controlled conversation' 
Crystal Guardian #3?| Halt.
Jake| Hey, man, I'm Jake.
Crystal Guardian #3| Beat it!
Jake|  I wanna know why you took my buddy and I'm not going to use force to get it out of you.
Crystal Guardian #3| I'm just following orders, bub.
Jake| Whose orders?
Crystal Guardian #3| Um, well, it's a secret but part of it is we're turning Finn into a crystal.
Finn| Jake, you can stop these guys now! 
Jake| Ah, man!
Finn|  get me out of here!
Crystal Guardian #3| No, you'll look awesome in crystal, like us!
Jake| Can't we work this out like gents?
Crystal Guardian #3| Get lost! 
Joshua| Jake, lose control, flip out on those guys!
Jake| No, dad, I gotta control myself!  Control, control, control, con-trol.
Finn|  Help! My arm! 
Jake| Whoa, okay okay. I'm hatching a controlled plan. Alright, man, move out of the way and let me get my friend.
Crystal Guardian #3| Nope, not doing it.
Jake| Then I'll have to move you myself,  with my mind. 
Crystal Guardian #3| You're going to hurt yourself. Stop it.
Jake|  
Crystal Guardian #3| You're time is running out little dog. Hey, speed it up in there, guys.
Crystal Guardian #1| Okay, turn up the juice, man.
Crystal Guardian #2| Yeah, man. 
Finn|  JAKE, HELP!
Jake| Finn!  Don't hurt my buddy!  No, Jake, no, don't lose control.
Joshua|  Jake, Jake, come on punch them, Jake, punch everybody. Why not? Come on! Why not?!
Jake| No, no punchies! I am in control! 
Crystal Guardian #3| Who are you talking to?
Jake| Nobody, man, don't look at me! 
Crystal Guardian #3| Whoa,  did you guys see that?
Crystal Guardians|  Yeah. Yes
Finn| Don't make fun of him, he's having problems, everybody has- 
Jake|  Stupid-ghost-dad! I'll show him!  Okay, intimidate them with controlled attack.
Crystal Guardian #3| Hurry up, guys, I gotta drop a crystal donk.
Crystal Guardian #2| Oh, come on, I don't wanna hear that.
Crystal Guardian #3| Hey, whatever man, I ain't ashamed- whoa, what the?! 
Jake|   open up! Feel my controlled attack! Whoooomp psssh  Whoooomp psssh, Oooo oooh psssh.
Crystal Guardian #3| Stop it!
Jake| I'm not hurting you am I?
Crystal Guardian #3| No,  you freak!
Jake| Well, there's a lot more where that came from! So you best tell me why you're turning Finn into a crystal.
Crystal Guardian #3| Or what, you'll touch me?
Jake| So, help me I will touch you!
Finn|  JAKE! AHH! HELP!!
Jake| Finn, oh no!
Crystal Guardian #3|  cut it out he looks good.
Finn| MY BODY!!  
Jake| Nooo! My bud!! 
Crystal Guardian #2| Ah, let him in, he can't do nothing now.
Jake|  I'm sorry, Finn, I'm super lame and now...you're dead.
Finn| I'm not dead, I'm just all crystal stiff.
Jake| Oh.
A voice| Get your hands off My lover!
Jake| That voice.
Finn| It sounds like-
Tree Trunks|  Yes, Finn, it's me, Tree Trunks.  but in this world I am known as Quartzion the Crystal Queen.
Finn| Oh my grosh, you're alive!
Tree Trunks| Oh, I'm more than alive, Finn. After I ate that Crystal Apple in the scary dark forest, I was transported to this crystal dimension where I become ruler of the crystal men. And the crystal men are all in love with me.
Crystal Guardians| Love you Quartzion! Quartzion, I love you! Quartzion, we love you! 
Tree Trunks| Yes, yes I know, but you love... is not enough   I wanted you, Finn, so you could be transformed into my sexy crystal king.
Finn| Tree Trunks, you've gone bananas with crystal power!
Tree Trunks| Finn, it's not sexy for a king to call his queen bananas! 
Finn| Jake, you totally gotta stop her!
Jake| I'll try man, but I'm still figuring out my bizz,  here I come, Tree Trunks!  Taste my gentle rubs!
Tree Trunks| Whoa there, don't you put your junk on my trunk! 
Finn| Go, Jake, go!
Jake| She's too sassy and powerful! 
Joshua|  Jake, Jake, I brought someone here to see you, it's your brother.
Jake| Jermaine?! Are you dead?
Jermaine| Nah man, we're just dreamin' at the same time.
Jake| Oh, I'm sorry about that time I beat you up.
Jermaine| That was an accident, I knew you were just horsin' off!
Jake| But dad, you said I was going to hurt everybody!
Joshua| Yeah, every-bod-y.
Jake| I don't know, dad, that doesn't really help me.
Joshua| Everybody who is evil, Jake. Let me finish next time, hm, yeah?
Jake| Oh, well then I'm over it then! Rarr 
Finn| Jake, kick Tree Trunks in the tummy, shes probably still got that crystal gem inside her!
Jake| That must be giving her all her powers!
Tree Trunks| Marry me, Finn, we can snuggle through time and space and kiss each other in an alternate dimensional place.
Tree Trunks|  Oh, dear.
Jake| TT, you're back.
Tree Trunks| Oh, Jake, I was behaving so inappropriately I'm so embarrassed.
Jake| Oh shush, Tree Trunks, if I had a penny for every time someone went crazy hopped up on magic energy... I'd be Abraham Lincoln!
Finn| Tree Trunks, you're okay!
Jake & Tree Trunks| Finn!
Finn| I'm okay toooo! 
Tree Trunks| Oh, Finn, I was trapped here for so long and all I could think about was you and how your so nice to me and I, and I just wanted to say... I think... you're cute and I like you.
Finn|  Okay, okay, let's go.
Tree Trunks| Finn, when we get home, it's apple pie time.
Finn| Ooooh!! 
Tree Trunks| ♪Apple pie in the oven, Tell me you can taste lovin'♪
Princess Bubblegum|  And so, through my experiments with cloud-seeding, I've invented... liquid pyrotechnics.
Jake|  That's really cool, PB!
Princess Bubblegum|  Aw, thanks, puppy. 
Jake|  Isn't it cool, Finn?
Finn|   Owwww-guh...
Princess Bubblegum|  
Princess Bubblegum|  Uh, Finn. No. Come on, Finn, don't be weird. Look, I'll see you guys later.
Finn|  Huh? Oh. 
Jake|  It's letting up. Hey, Finn, come on, let's go do something.
Finn|  
Jake|   BMO, put on a game.
Finn|  
Jake|  Oh, Finn.... Uncle Jakey's gonna find you a new love interest.
Jake|  Finn, I'm going out for a quick.... walk in the woods.
Finn|  
Jake|  BMO, you look after him with your camera-eyes.
BMO|  If anyone tries to hurt Finn, I will kill them.
Jake|  Ok, good.
Flambo|  
Jake|  Woman!
Jake|  I'll save you, wash tub princess!
Flambo|  
Jake|  You're safe now, Miss... Flambo?!
Flambo|  Yeah, it's me.  Bet you thought I was dame on account of my girlish screamin'.
Jake|  I did think that. 
Flambo|  Haha, well. Thanks, anyway, brother.
Jake|  Hey.... You're pretty plugged-in, Flambo. Do you know any princesses Finn's age?
Flambo|  Oh, yeah. I know just the skirt, ...and she's way hot!
Jake|  She's from Fire Kingdom? I think I'll die if I go in there.
Flambo|  Heh, oh yeah.
Jake|  Ow...
Flambo|  There, I cast Flame Shield on yous. Also I spat on yous.
Jake|   BMO-cam on.
Finn|  Gold-darn you, tear ducts! Yah! Yah! 
Jake|  Ugh... Hang in there, buddy.
Jake|  
Jake|   Yo! What up? I'm Jake, Jake the  Dooug.
Flambo|   Dude, you gotta pretend like you're of royal blood.
Jake|  Could have told me this sooner.
Flambo|  Haha! Yeah.
Jake|  Good morrow, Majesty!  I am Sir Jake, Baron of the Grasslands!
Flame King|  Hmmmmm.... What do you seek? Speak! 
Jake|   Uhk-uhg... I come as an envoy of Prince Finn.
Flame King|  A prince?!
Flame People|   A prince! Finn is a prince! Yeah, a prince!
Jake|  Yeah and he's the same age as your daughter. 
Flame Princess|  Oooh...
Flame King|  Bold words, but know you that my daughter is a rare jewel. She cannot be wooed by just any ragamuffin prince!
Jake|  Umm.... Oh, Prince Finn is AWESOME!
Flame People|   An awesome prince?! That's the best kind!
Flame King|  Silence, my molten mommas.  We are perplexed. If you are a baron true, where is your gift? 'Tis common practice among visiting dignitaries.
Flame People|   Yeah, a gift! Where is the gift?!
Flambo|   You're blowin' it, bromite.
Jake|   A gift?! Sire, Prince Finn sent, uh... three gifts! 
Flambo|   What?!
Flame King|  Hmmmm.... Three is more than one.
Flame People|   Wait a second, three's a lot of gifts! I want three gifts!
Flame Princess|   Oooh...
Jake|  The first gift is  um-um-um this water bottle.
Flame Jester|   
Flame Princess|  
Flame King|  Prince Finn has smoked my jester! Pourquoi?!  ...I do hate my jester.
Jake|  Uh, Prince Finn hated him too.
Flame Princess|  Hmmm...
Jake|  For your second gift, a, uh... hmmmm oh!
Flame Princess|  
Flame King|  A fire inside my body?! I am disgusted! Give me your third terrible gift and be on your way!
Jake|   Oh, Finn, I'm so sorry!
Finn|   BMO, go away! 
BMO|   Whoooop.... Duck, Duck, Duck, Goose!
Finn|  
Flame King|  Is that him? He looks terrible! Why isn't he here? Why did he send his buffoon?! Leave now, buffoon, for you have failed!
Jake|  No, wait! Uh-um,  Prince Finn is here!  He's riiight... here!
Jake|  Greetings, Flame King! My final gift is your favorite thing in the world.
Flame King|  A koala bear?
Jake|  Uh, yes!
Jake|  
Jake|  Eucalyptus! Eucalyptus!
Flame King|  I don't like koalas anymore. Begone!
Jake|  
Jake|  Dude, don't cry.
Jake|  Can't help it! I'm in love with Bubblegum!
Jake|  She's too old for you.
Jake|   I don't care!
Jake|  Come on! Flame Princess seems into you.
Jake|  No, no, no! Only Bubblegum!
Jake|  Ouw, Finn!  Finn, Finn, Finn, Finn stop man....
Jake|  Ahh-ahh!
Jake|   Fiiiinn. 
Flame King|  Excellent!
Jake|  Huh?!
Flame King|  You have indeed proven yourself! Any prince ruthless enough to kill his own buffoon would make an excellent boyfriend...
Jake|   Yeah!
Flame King|  ... for my evil daughter!
Jake|  Whaaaat?!
Flame King|  She's an unstoppable force of destruction. Ahhhh, nothing a psycho like you can't handle. Congratulations!
Flame Princess|  I'm so happy! I'm so happy to meet you, Prince. You're my Prince. 
Flame People|   That's sweet. That's so sweet.
Jake|   She seems normal.
Flame People|   Yeah, she seems normal.
Flame Princess|  Stop whispering! 
Flambo|  Hey, so that's where I came from.
Jake|  You know, on second thought, ...we're not really each other's types.
Flame Princess|  We're... what?
Jake|  I changed my mind. I don't like you.
Flame Princess|  You... WHAT?! 
Jake|   Uh, nothing.  Bye, Flambo. 
Jake|  
Jake|  Finn! I really messed up.
Jake|  Finn, buddy, you gotta help me. I made a mistake.
Jake|  
Finn|  Who lit that fire?! I'll kill you!
Finn|   Yaaah! 
Finn|   Bubblegum's rockets!  Don't you touch her stuff!!!
Flame Princess|  
Finn|  It's a girl.
Flame Princess|  You! What's wrong with me, huh?! You don't like me?!
Finn|   I like you!
Flame Princess|  What's wrong with you?!
Flame Princess|  Don't ever mess with me again!
Finn|   Who was that?
Jake|   The Princess of the Fire Kingdom?
Finn|   Dude, I think I have a crush.
Finn|   Ahhh... YEAH!!! 
Jake|   Heh heh.  Aw, yeah. 
Finn|  Jake, get ready for a slap in the jowls.  Seriously, though... get ready... for a day filled with adventure!
Jake|  Whoa, really?!
Finn|  Yeah, man!!  I wrote on my arm this to-do list of cool junk.  Number one back flip off this bridge and do the splits. Number two track down and slay a goblin horde. Number three... storm clouds?
Jake|   Hmmm...  Finn... it's a knife storm!!  It's raining knives, man! Come on! 
Finn|  I've never seen a knife storm before... It's beautiful.
Jake|  Looks like we're stayin' in today, kid.
Finn|  Well, what're we gonna do?
BMO|  Who wants to play video games??
Finn and Jake|  BMO!!
Jake|  What's on the menu, BMO?
BMO|  I've created a new game called Conversation Parade.
Finn|  Hah! Alright!
Jake|  Start it up, BMO!
BMO|   What do you think about the stars in the sky?
Finn|  'S okay, I guess.
Jake|  Yeah, they're cool.
BMO|  That is an interesting response! Battery low... Shut doooowwwwn...
Finn|  Booooo.
Jake|  BMO, that was weak.
Finn|  What now?
Jake|  Ooh, ooh! Dude, I know somethin' totally rockin' we can do!
Finn|  Whoa! What?!
Jake|  Let's use our imaginations, man!
Finn|  Barf that! Imagination is for turbo nerds who can't handle how kick-butt reality is! I'm a kick-butt reality master!! I would rather die than be imaginative. I mean that.
Jake|  Eh. Your loss.  AAAH!!! Lava!! Lava all around us!!  Lava on the floor!
Finn|  Shut up, man...
Jake|  Seriously, man! There must be an enchantment on the house or somethin'!
Finn|  I'm not playing you child-style games, guy. Watch and learn as I master... reality. 
Jake|  NOOOOO!!
Finn|   AAAAH!!!  Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jake! What the hey-hey?!
Jake|  I was just playin' around with my imagination...  ...and then everything got intense.
Finn|  It's like... whatever you imagine becomes real... That's bananas!
Jake|   Don't imagine blowin' apart my own brain... Don't imagine my eyeballs coming alive and flying around with rocket packs...
Finn|  Dude! Imagine that BMO invented a better video game, and that he has new batteries.
Finn and Jake|  WHOA!
Finn|  But first stop imagining lava!
Jake|  I can't! My imagination's too amazing!
Finn|  Imagine turning your imagination off!
Jake|  I can't, dude... but I think I can imagine an imagination turning-off machine... that is upstairs, surrounded by a crud-load of traps, ghosts, monsters, and poison fountains, and... and... girls. Cute girls, and hamsters.
Finn|  Can't you make it easier to get to that machine?
Jake|  You can't hold this baby back! That's bad parenting, mamma!
Finn|  Then it's up to me to take your imagination downtown! Let's go to the den and suit up!
Jake|  Neat!  Grab that missile.
Finn|  Okay.
Jake|  And... get that cosmic gauntlet.
Finn|  Nah. There's a better one over by the desk. Ah! UNH!  What did I just hit?!
Jake|  I'm imagining a wall. You can just go around it.
Finn|  Really? That's it? There isn't any invisible, angry troll or anything?
Jake|  Oh, there's one now.  Look out!
Finn|  Aah! I can feel it on my foot!  I'll kill you, troll! Yah! Yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah!
Jake|  You're kickin' too high! He's shorter than you!
Finn|  Yah, yah! 
Jake|  Alright! You're gettin' him, man!  Uh-oh. Now you're uppercutting his family.  Heh heh heh heh heh! You just kicked his wife in the face!  She's comin' back for revenge.
Finn|  Cram this! We gotta book it to your imagination machine! Yah!
Jake|  The knife storm, remember?!?!  Oh, boy... Ooh... Finn, I found some candy.  It tastes like banana candy, man.  Here, man. Try some.
Finn|   Okay. Try to imagine some kind of steel umbrella over the bridge so... we don't get knifed.
Jake|  Okay!  It is done.
Finn|   Haha! Ha! Hey, you did it, man!
Riddle Master|  No, voyagers. To pass this bridge, you must first pass the test of the riddle.
Finn|   An imaginary riddle master?
Finn|   Ask me your riddle, Riddle Master. I accept your test.
Riddle Master|  Then brace yourself, fool, for this riddle comes from a mysterious, far-away land.
Finn|   LAY IT ON ME!!
Riddle Master|  Yes, um... The riddle, uh... It... cometh... uh...
Jake|  I can't imagine a riddle.
Finn|  Dude, just make it super easy.
Riddle Master|  THE RIDDLE COMETH! Tell me, voyager. What is simple, and yet also... a riddle?
Finn|  Man, that riddle sucks.
Riddle Master|  THAT IS THE WRONG ANSWER!! The penalty is... DEATH BY SNAKES!!
Finn|  YEAH, RIGHT! I'VE GOT A MISSILE!!
Jake|  You exploded the snakes right at us!!
Finn|  I can feel them all over my face! Imaginary poison coursing through my veins!!
Jake|  I'm sorry, brother! I'm so sorry!
Finn|  Let's just get to your imagination machine and we'll be okay!!
Jake| AAH! A big bowl of baby elephants, chainsaws, and doo-doo's flyin' towards us!! JUMP, DUDE!!  Here come's a soul-eater! Snap its neck!  The Bazooka Goblin has you in its sights!
Finn|  Hey! Don't shoot us with that bazooka!
Finn|  Don't you do it...
Finn|  DON'T DO IT, MAN!!!
Bazooka Goblin|  Hee... heehee... hee... Okay.
Jake|  YEAH!
Finn|  AW, YEAH!
Finn|  Alright, use your powers or something. This poison is about to kill me.
Jake|  Alright. Goin' up. Check it. My imagination-off machine is left of the bed.
Finn|  Is it clear?
Jake|  Yeah, I mean there's a bunch of cute girls... but they shouldn't bother you.
Finn|  Oh! I found the shut-off lever!
Jake|  Cool, man!  Dang, girl. If you weren't a figment of my imagination, I'd want to have your baby.  What're you laughin' at?
Finn|  Alright. I'm gonna turn it off.  UNH!! You said it was clear of danger!!
Jake|  Dude... I can't see anything... I must've imagined... an invisible monster!!
Finn|  What?! Well, how do I kill it?! 
Jake|  I'm comin', buddy! Alright, Invisibo. Eat a piece of this!  Hurry, Finn! Get to the lever!
Finn|  Okay! I'm doin' iiiit!!  Aw, yeah! The imaginary poison is gone, Jake! Jake?  Hey, come on. Wake up, man.
Jake|   Hello, Finn. I am awake and healthy.
Finn|  Jake... what happened to your bombastic personality?
Jake|  I do not know what you mean. I am perfectly bombastic.
Finn|  Nah, man, nah. Somethin's wrong. Tell me something amazing!
Jake|  But Finn, I cannot tell you something amazing as there is nothing amazing happening around us that I could describe for you.
Finn|  Ah, see, man, you suck now! Crap, it's your imagination. You need that thing. 
Finn|  Jake... Stop it, man. You're just playing one continuous note.
Jake|  One note is all that is needed.
Finn|   I'm gonna turn your imagination back on.  Jake! Your imagination on-off switch has vanished!
Jake|  True. Doth thou not remember shutting down mine imagination?
Finn|  I remembereth.
Jake|  I am happy that my imagination is gone. It was purposeless.
Finn|  No! It was the opposite of that stuff. I know this now...  ...only too late. Okay, man. I'm gonna try to imagine an imagination back-on switch for you, and so you know, if there's anything dainty inside my imagination, I'm gonna be mad. Imagination... go...  What the stuff? Well... this isn't so bad.  Nothing lame, at least. Hey! And there's Jake's imagination switch!
Finn|   Cram. Oh! Maybe I can try imagining something.  Now for that switch.
Bellamy Bug|   Good morrow, sir! My name is Bellamy Bug! Would you care for a crotchet doily my daughter made? She imbued it with her tears. You see, she recently broke up with a gentle dandy.
Finn|  No! How'd you get in my Imagination Land?!
Bellamy Bug|   I don't know, my young fellow! You tell me. Perhaps I represent your secret desire to be civilized!
Finn|  REPRESENT THIS!  And this.  which both punch him.]
Bellamy|  Oh! I say! Oh! Ah! Ouch! Ah!
Finn|  Haha... Penguins... Hahahaha! Heh, alright.  I hope this works, Jake!  Haha, yeah!  Hey! Get away from that! Don't push that hyper drive button! 
Jake|   Aaaah!! I can imagine EVERYTHING!!!
Finn|   Take a hike, fairy! Normal style! 
Jake|   Aw, man... I imagined my mom naked!  Yugh!
Finn|  You okay?
Jake|  I think so. Lemme check. Mmmm... Yup. She's clothed now. And hey, man! It's clear out now! We can go on an adventure!
Finn|  I don't know, dude. I think we got all the adventure we need right here...  with... lava on the floor!
Jake|  Huh?!  AAH! AAH! MY LEGS ARE MELTING! Just kidding. 
Finn|  Hahahaha! Good dog. 
Finn| Oh, geez. Oh, geez. Ugh, come on. Uh... Come on. Come on.
Bubblegum| Finn, don't worry about it. We've got bigger fish to fry right now.
Finn| But...
Bubblegum| It's fine. Pep-but used to love being scattered all around. He used to tell me that.
Peppermint Butler's mouth| Lies!
Bubblegum|  Those farmers won't keep this thing busy for long.  So it's up to the four of us to stop him. Are you ready, Marceline? Marceline? Hey, what's wrong?
Marceline|  Me, I guess.
Bubblegum| What?
Marceline| Me. I'm wrong. This—all of this—this is all my fault. Even just fighting the vampires in the first place screwed everything up. Sure screwed me up, anyway. And, geez Louise, trying to fix it—trying to fix me... Just made things a thousand times worse. So why even try, you know? What's the point?
Bubblegum| What? Marceline, no. Come on! We're always the underdogs, you and me, and we always pull through. Like that one time, you remember? The case of the purloined egg?
Marceline| No! I told you, that's it. I'm done.
Cloud Dance| All right people, this is our last stand! It's gonna take every one of us to see this thing through—me, Onion Man, Short Man, Terry— whoa!—Short-Stack, Good-Beard, DeShawn, Seedman, Sandwich Paul, Angry Susan...
Cloud Dance| Muy Linda, Dr. Belstar...
Farmer|  Help!
Cloud Dance| ...Limbo Man, Quasar, Dogman, Tightwad, Raspberry Sam...
Farmer #2| Up here!
Cloud Dance| ...DJ Fresh-Start, and my boy Big Trace.
Finn| You sure you're not coming, Marceline? We could really use your help. Marceline? Okay, maybe later then.
Jake| Come on, Finn! Let me hear that war cry!
Marceline|  Well, you finally did it, big guy. You won. Well played. I just kind of wish you would gotten it over with a thousand years ago and saved us all some trouble.
Marceline| Better late than never, I guess. 
Ice King| You remembered my song! 
Marceline| Simon? W-what are you doing here?
Ice King| Well, I saw through my peeping scope that everything was going boom and exploding and monsters, and all my friends were in grave danger and horrible torment.
Marceline| And you wanted to help?
Ice King| No! I felt left out. I'm just a phone call away, you know.
Marceline|  I'm sorry, Simon. Next time, for sure.  Anyway, you don't want in on this fight. This one's a loser.
Ice King| Oh, I see. Sittin' this one out, huh?
Marceline| Yeah, I guess. And don't try to talk me out of it.
Ice King| What? No, no, I'm right there with you. You and me—we're survivors, right? Like cockroaches or rats. Sure, you could fight and try to save the day, but what if you lose? Then what? You could die. Better to rot and hide like a rat, right, buddy? 
Marceline| Ugh!  Did you just call me a cockroach, Simon?!
Ice King| What? No! No, no, no, no.
Marceline| Thanks, buddy.
Ice King| Yes.
King of Ooo| Ahh, this is nice. Getting a little warm for royal fineries, though.  Mm-hmm!
Crunchy| Princess? It sounds pretty bad out there. Perhaps you should protect your people.
King of Ooo| Yeesh, it does sound bad! Hey, banana men, listen to your princess! In my kingdom, we look after our own—me! You look after me! Close the gates!
Banana Guard| S-she's beautiful.
Banana Guard #2| You're preachin' to the preacher, brother.
King of Ooo| I'm beautiful! Close the gate!
Banana Guard| No. You're not beautiful.  We see you clearly now. You're earwax!
Banana Guard| You're earwax!
King of Ooo| Aah! Huh?!
Crunchy| And the power returns to Crunchy!
King of Ooo| Aah!
King of Ooo| But you love m-e-e-e-e! 
Crunchy| And instead of a wax idol, they shall have a true princess... Wrought of iron, with teeth of diamonds. Her heart is ice! Her will is fire! Princess Crunchy, the unforgiving!  Go fight that thing for me!
Finn| Whoa!
Jake| Finn, this ain't workin'. It's just fart grabbin'.
Finn| Yeah, but what else can we do?
Bubblegum|  Dudes, I don't know.
Farmer| Look!
Chet|   Whoa!
Marceline|  I'm gonna poop my pants if Finn kills this guy instead of me!
Peppermint Butler| Wha?!
Marceline| King? Vampire king? You still in here? Hello? Too bad.
Marceline| Oh, boy! Ooh, I am famished!
Farmer| The beast weakens!
Cow| Whoa-ho-ho. Whoa!
Bubblegum| Marceline?
Finn| Marceline?
Marceline| Sorry, what?
Finn| I was just saying we stocked your fridge with lipstick and stuff, so you'll have lots to eat.
Marceline| Aww, thanks, dude.
Jake|" Also, we got you crosswords, ""sudukus,"" and connect-the-dots. Just take her easy, buddy."
Marceline| Sure.
Bubblegum| Oh, hey, I was thinking—so, once I usurp Crunchy, I'll have my castle back again, and there's plenty of room there if you don't want to be alone.
Marceline| No, I think I need to ruminate a little—think about being a vampire again.
Finn|" Are you, uh... Do you feel bad? I don't want to say, like, ""I'm sorry about who you are"" or anything if you're feeling okay, but I don't know how bad news all of this is... Right?"
Marceline| Nah, I'm cool being a vampire again. Being mortal was good... At the same time, it was terrifying. Now I'm a vampire with fresh mortal memories and—I don't know—more empathy or something... More grown-up. Bonnie, thank you for helping me grow up. Now, I guess we get to hang out together forever.
Finn| Take care!
Bubblegum| See ya, Marcy!
Jake| Later, Vampire Queen!
Vampire King| Your friends seem nice.
Marceline| Um... Are you, like, in my head now, or what?
Vampire King| For now.
Marceline| Well, just don't get in my wa—
Finn|  The Tree of Blight.
Finn|  Every hundred years, it spews evil spores across the land.
Jake|  Then let's burn its butt down to the root rubbin's.  Finn, I can feel a bunch of eyeballs peepin' us from the woods.
Alpha Hug Wolf|  Huuugs!
Finn|  What the—?! Is this an extra butt?!  Quick, Jake! Burn the tree!
Alpha Hug Wolf| Huuuugs!  Gonna hug you up, boy! I'm gonna snuggle you to pieces!
Jake|  Dude! The tree's about to 'splode its evil juice all over!
Finn|  No!  Jake, hurry!
Jake|  Is he crushin' you, man?!
Finn|   No, he's just... hugging me gently!
Jake|"  Oh...!  When you see the wicker devil in tree afterlife, tell 'im Jake says, ""Hello."""
Jake|  Hey, buddy, you okay?
Finn|  Didn't even tell me its name...
Jake|  Wha..,?
Finn|   Oh, sweet! Ha-ha-ha!
Finn and Jake|   Hot to the touch!
Jake|  Hmmmm... Dude, why're you so huggy?
Finn|  I just feel affectionate, I guess. Hugging helps.
Jake|  Hmm...  You've got a fever, man.
Finn|  I feel hot. 
BMO|  Finn, you're hurting me.
Jake|  I think you need a good night's sleep.
Jake|  You feelin' better today?
Finn|  Yeah. I feel like a million clams.
Jake|  Good. Hey, you think we have enough candy litter?  Litter for lunch! Mmm!
Cinnamon Bun|  Huh? Not again!
Finn|  What's the matter, Cinnamon Bun?
Cinnamon Bun|  Please, Finn. If you're gonna hug me again, don't make it as hard as you hugged me last night.
Finn|  Uh... I didn't hug you last night.
Cinnamon Bun|  Yes, you did! My love handles still hurt! You came into my room around midnight and gave me a squeeze—a really strong one! 
Finn|  CB says I hugged 'im. Haha. Cinnamon Bun, you got some crazy notions. I tell ya.  Oh, Cinnamon Bun.   What a crazy story, buddy.
Jake|  Yeah, buddy, but you were pretty huggy last night... buddy.
Finn|  Wait. You don't think I actually snuck into Cinnamon Bun's room and hugged him, do you?
Jake|  I'm just sayin' you were really clingy.
Finn|    But no. Why would I? And don't tell me it's because I have repressed emotional feelings for Cinnamon Bun.
Jake|  No. I have a theory, ...but I don't like it.
Jake|  Your questionable behavior started about an hour or so after you got hugged by that wolf man, right?
Finn|  ...So...?
Jake|"  Well, I've been thinkin' that maybe that wolf man wasn't what he seemed. Maybe he was some sort of hug wolf. Yeah, here it is.  ""Hug wolves—a subset of wolf men which roam the countryside with a fervid hug lust. Every night, hug wolves must go out and hug people to satisfy their insatiable craving for hugs. To become a hug wolf, one must be hugged by an alpha hug wolf on the night of a full moon.""!"
Finn|  Like last night!
Jake|  Yes. So you must be a beta hug wolf. A lower-level creature.
Finn|  Well, how can I get uncursed?
Jake|  Lemme, um... read the book a little more. Says there's no known cure.
Finn|  Uh... I'm scared, Jake... 
Jake|  No hugs!!
Finn|  I'm sorry!  I feel hot! Rrrrr!!
Jake|  What's wrong, BMO?
BMO|  I am terrified of Finn.
Jake|  Hmm. Well, that plant's not gonna protect you.  You can get this under control, buddy. ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??
Finn|  I think so.
Jake|  I said... ARE YOU READY TO OVERCOME THIS THING??
Finn|  Yeah. I heard you. I said I think so.
Jake|  I'm tryin'a' getcha to shout.
Finn|  Oh. Okay. IS THIS GOOD?!?
Jake|  Never mind. Now. I want you to think about hugging a cactus. How would that feel?
Finn|  Prickly and painful.
Jake|  Good, good, you're doin' great!
Finn|  Cool. So, can I hug the cactus now?
Jake|  No, you can't hug anything.
Finn|  But that poor cactus! It... it... NEEDS ME! 
Jake|  Oh, no, the hug lust is already takin' over your brain!
Finn|   I want to hug you, Jake! Close!
Jake|  Finn... say something to reassure me.
Finn|  I'LL HUG YOUR MOM!
BMO|  Jake! We need the silver baseball!
Finn|  Hrrugs!! HUGS FOR BUDDIES! 
BMO|  Oh, Glob! Oh, my Glob, Jake! Mama!
Finn|  Bring it in, guys!
BMO|  Screamoooo!
Jake|  BMO! Strobe light mode! 
Finn|  Not cool!
Jake|  Back, beast!
Finn|  Hug wolf, away!
Mr. Cupcake|  Surely this frosted drink will soothe my fevered tempers.  Hellooo? Good heavens! A lycanthrope! AAAAH!!
Finn|   Hug you up, bro! 
Gumdrop teenager|  Dracula? AAAAH!! Eeee!!
Finn|   HUUUUGS!!
Gumdrop dad|  Get away from my daughter, ya hairy teenager!  Ch-ch... 
Gumdrop teenager|  Aaah!!
Gumdrop dad|  Ch-ch.  Ch-ch.  Eh... eh... SHE'LL NEVER MARRY! 
Jake|  Finn? Finn?
BMO|  There he is!
Finn|  Huh? Huh?  What... What happened? Jake... what happened to me last night?
Jake|  You hugged... everyone.
Finn|  NO!
Upside-Down Ice Cream Cone|  We're mad, but we're not gonna go down there.
Finn|  People of the Candy Kingdom, all I've ever wanted was to keep you all safe, ...and because I can't undo the hugs I've caused, my sole wish is to be locked up forever in the Candy Dungeon.
Candy Baby|  Why's Finn in the cage, Mama? Isn't hugs nice?
Candy Mother|  Oh, baby... 
Jake|  Candy People, let's make sure that Alpha Hug Wolf pays for what he's done!!
Candy Person #29|  Yeah!
Candy Person #33|  Yeah, I agree with the last guy!
Jake|  Cinnamon Bun, you watch over Finn!
Cinnamon Bun|  Uuuuuhhhh...
Jake|  Let's go, boys!!
Cinnamon Bun|  Uh... bu-, bububut...
Crowd|  No more hugs! No more hugs! No more hugs!
Random Candy Person|  Without consent!!
Cinnamon Bun|  Uh...
Finn|  Huh?  HUUUGS!! 
Cinnamon Bun|  Finn?  Uh...
Finn|  Cinnamon Bun... let me out...
Cinnamon Bun|  I-I-I-I'm not supposed to.
Finn|  Don't you want a hug?
Cinnamon Bun|  I can't, man!
Finn|  Not even a little one?
Cinnamon Bun|  Uuuuhhh...
Finn|  You want a hug?
Cinnamon Bun|   YES!! HUG ME!!!!  C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon...  Which way does this turn?!?  Owww! Ow, my sides.
Candy crowd|  SAY NO TO HUGS!
Jake|  I smell someone bein' hugged right now! 
Antelope|  Uh... I have a wife.
Jake|  That hug be your last, demon!
Alpha Hug Wolf|  Rrr...still love you!  Raaah! Come here, baby!
Jake|  No huggies!  Eh... Finn... I've failed you.
Alpha Hug Wolf|  I'm gonna hug you up.
Finn|  You call that a hug?
Jake|  This is the biggest hug that's ever existed!
Finn|  Uuuugghhh... Huh?  You... You stopped hugging me.
Beautiful Lady|  Yeah... You stopped, too.
Finn|  I just... didn't feel like I needed any more hugs.
Beautiful Lady|  Me neither.
Candy Person #29|  The curse is broken!
Jake|   Can I get a hug?
Finn|   JAKE!!!!!
Jake|  AAAH—!
Finn| You sad mobs. Y'all wish you had this sweet dang bucket!  Yaaaah!  Aah! It's mine time!  Get beat dead-meat!  My tool! Die!  Oh, a li'l zombie carrot.  I should've washed it.
Lemongrab| Impertinence.  Nyah! Grow! Grooow!
Jake| Aha! 
Finn|  Head's up! Oof.
Jake| Oof.
Finn| I got that bucket of pure river water you asked for. 
Jake| Thanks, dude.
Finn| Whatcha doing down here anyways?
Jake| Digging up diamonds for a little project.
Finn| I'll help, buddy.
Jake| Whew.
Jake| Hehe.  Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods! Vanilla no mods!
Finn| What the heck man?!  It's such a senseless waste.
Jake| Au contraire, mon friend. I'm extremely senseful. You see this bucket of water? It's in case I fall in the lava and catch fire.
Finn| You could make something really good with these. Like a better sword for your best bro.
Jake| Or .
Finn|  I'm gonna take this shiny boy, and show you the way.
Jake| You do you, buddy.
Finn| I'm sure you'd get it if you just took a moment to think about it. 
Jake|  Uh huh.
Lumpy Space Princess| Look guys, it was totally epic. I wrecked the library's glass ceiling like, NBD, then I pushed a creeper down there and all the stupid smart dorks cried like tiny stupid babies.
Gunter|  Wenk wenk.
Live-Giving Magus| That's small potaters. We should do something big. I got a storage full of live dynamite. 
Ice King| Hey. We should grief Finn and Jake. We could plant a tree on the Tree House! Huh..?
Lumpy Space Princess| Ugh. It's totally obvious you've never griefed anybody.
Ice King|" That's only technically true. And not to be ""that guy"", but it's actually  ""aggrieved""."
Lumpy Space Princess| You better grief someone quick if you wanna stay in the Gravel Gang! Only cool mean girls allowed!
Ice King| I'm ice-cool LSP.
Lumpy Space Princess| No! Call me by my gang name!
Ice King| Okay. Gravel Gal.
Lemongrab| Hnnngh. Grooooow!  Oh. Yes, of course.  Grow. No grooooowth!
Marceline| Who here loves windmills?  Haha, alright. Now get to work.
Finn| Yo, Marcy. That's a real nice windmill.
Marceline| Thanks. When it's done, I'm gonna grind up a whole mass of bone meal.
Skeleton| What's that, boss?
Marceline| Keep working, buddy. So, whatcha got there?
Finn| A little lump destined for something big.
Marceline| Just like your butt. Hah!
Finn| Good one. But no. I want to turn this diamond into something complex and awesome to really wow Jake.
Marceline| Well I recommend building a windmill.
Finn| A diamond windmill.
Princess Bubblegum| No, that's silly. You need something more sciencey.  Diamond, lapis, some gunpowder, juicy nugget, add the star to more gunpowder and paper - There!  I'm positive Jake will appreciate it for both its fleeting sensation of beauty, and its false sense of purpose.
Finn|  Up top.
Princess Bubblegum| What? Aw blocks.
Finn| He's been at it all day.
Princess Bubblegum| I should help him. See you later Finn.
Finn| Alright. M'ladies.  M'lemon. 
Lemongrab| Nyarg! 
Princess Bubblegum| Hey, it's okay buddy.
Lemongrab| Can't... tree!
Princess Bubblegum| You can't just hit something with a shovel and expect it to do your bidding.
Marceline| Yeah you can.
Lemongrab| What?
Princess Bubblegum| This is an oak sapling. This is a jungle sapling. . And this...  This is a lot of bone meal.
Marceline| Courtesy of Marceline the Bone Meal Queen.
Princess Bubblegum| Now we don't actually need the bone meal but it'll help speed things up, and as for the space requirements on the ground, it depends... 
Tree Trunks| How many aces do you have?
Mr. Pig| I got five.
Tree Trunks| Oh shoot, I only got two.
Finn| Hey y'all. 
Tree Trunks| Finn!
Finn| I was just passing through, but I could sure go for one of your famous apple pies.
Tree Trunks| Say no more. 
Finn| I'm no expert, but that kinda looks like a pumpkin.
Tree Trunks|  Sorry about that. I'm just plum out of apples but I got lots of pumpkins. Too many pumpkins.  Hot pie.
Finn|  Uh, this might sound a bit weird but I'm kinda tired and it's a long way home...
Tree Trunks| Say no more. 
Mr. Pig| Fine.
Tree Trunks| Bye bye boys.
Finn| Whoa!
Mr. Pig|  You know you could just tell me where to go.
Finn|  Dude, stop. Enderman. Don't look at it. It will-
Mr. Pig| What the heck is that?!
Finn| Oh Glob.
Finn| Hey!
Mr. Pig| Wee wee wee! Wee wee wee! Wee wee wee!
Finn| Enderman! Fight me!  Oh no.
Finn| So, uh... Do you have, like, another job, or is this what you do full time? I saw you carrying that block back there. You into building stuff?
Finn| I bet endermen have hobbies just like everyone else.
Lemongrab| Who-aah? Mhmm, mhmm, mhmm.
Princess Bubblegum| Whew. Good work. Let's call it a day.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Meh. Beh. Beans? Beans.  That noise.  Finn, I'm trying to sleep!
Finn|  Hey LSP. Don't be scared.
Lumpy Space Princess|  What are you even doing, just looking at this guy's toes?
Finn| Yeah, I have to.
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh. I don't get it. Does this guy even have toes? Are those his toes? I don't think I've ever even seen a toe, come to think of it. What am I even talking about?
Finn|  Thank you I've been stuck here so long!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Haha. Sure... Ew! You're all smelly and wet. Get out of here!
Finn| Fair enough. 
Lumpy Space Princess|  But come back after you've showered.
Ice King| Yoink. 
Finn| Thief!
Ice King| You got griefed!  I'm not looking at you! I'm not looking!
Lemongrab|  Good morning. How dare you.  Lemon seed babies!  Oh, you shall be my true heirs.  What?! A apple?  Unacceptable! UNACCEPTABLE!
Tree Trunks| Oh, gracious.  Good job, Lemon-crab. 
Lemongrab|  Pie me. Pie me for my apples.
Jake| Pie.
Finn| You won't believe what I went though to get this.
Jake| Oh yeah, you were gonna make something right? 
Finn|  Whoa! You did it! You took the fruits of our labor and transformed them into something beautiful and unexpected.
Finn| D'aw come on! Diamonds are so hard to get!  Oh, duh. Beauty is in the hard work itself and the oftentimes false sense of purpose we feel when doing it. It's a fleeting sensation that drives us to repeat our actions in order to capture it again.  That was supposed to be fireworks.
Jake| I like this better.
Finn|  Jake.
Finn|   Wizard Battle is starting soon!
Jake|   I know! We got here six hours early, you dork! Just wake me up when they start selling hot dogs.  Whoa! What do you know! 
Finn|  The wizards are arriving!
Finn|  Whoo-hoo! Yeah!!!
Grand Master Wizard|   Ladies and gentlemen...
Finn|  
Grand Master Wizard|  I am the Grand Master Wizard of Ceremonies. And now, the rules. Contestants will fight each other with spells from the eight schools of magic.  No science, Science Whyzard!  No weapons, Weapon Head!  To enter Wizard Battle, you must be a wizard!
Finn|   Whoo, wizard only allowed! Whoo. Whoo. Wh-... Oh, what? Ice King!
Jake|  Boo!
Finn|  You're a contestant?!
Ice King|  Mm-hmm. You guys come here to watch me win?
Finn|  Phshoo, you're gonna lose, man.
Jake|  You're a loser.
Ice King|  Ha! I'm not gonna lose! I've got a foolproof plan for winning.  I'm gonna cheat. 
Grand Master Wizard|  And now L's and G's, witness the unveiling of this tournaments grand prize,  A kiss from Princess Bubblegum!  On the mouth!
Lady Wizard #1|  Boooo. Boo.
Brain Wizard|  Hmm. Is it an open mouth kiss?
Grand Master Wizard|  No!
Brain Wizard|  Then I choose to exit the battle.
Grand Master Wizard|  No one is allowed to exit Wizard Battle!  The doors are shut.  The sky barrier is in place. All of you will kiss the princess or die in battle.
Ice King|  Ooh, I just can't wait to taste that sweet Bubblegum. 
Finn|   Jake, we gotta enter the contest and stop Ice King.
Jake|  But we're not wizards, man. What about the sanctity and honor of Wizard Battle?
Finn|  I'd rather sanctify PB's lips.
Jake|  Ooooh! You don't care about the Ice King. You just wanna kiss Princess Bubblegum.
Finn|  No! I wanna save the princess!
Jake|  Mm-hmm. Yeah, you do.
Finn|  I do!
Jake|  Yeah, you do.
Finn|  Oh, shush! 
Finn|  Now, where's the Ice King.
Jake|  Over there!
Ice King|   Oh, yeah.
Finn|  We need a plan, man.
Jake|  Okay. When the wizards start to battle, let's go hide behind that rock.
Grand Master Wizard|  By the rays of the setting sun, the battle of wizards has begun!
Jake|  Looks like everyone had the same plan.
Finn|  What are they waiting for?
Abracadaniel|  The opposites.
Finn|  Huh?
Abracadaniel|  The wizards with opposite powers will take each other on first.
Finn|  And are you a wizard?
Abracadaniel|  Yes. My name is Abracadaniel. 
Finn|  Hi, Abracadaniel. My name is, uh, Magic...  Fist.
Jake|   Whoa. This kid looks like a wimp.
Abracadaniel|  Who's that?
Finn|  He's my, uh, magic second head.
Abracadaniel|  Well, he's right.  I only entered this contest 'cause I thought the prize would be money. But it's just a kiss!
Finn|  You mean, you don't care about kissing PB?
Abracadaniel|  Blegh, no way. If I was the winner, I would turn my face so our lips  wouldn't touch and I would push Princess away. Turn and push, turn and push, turn and push...
Finn|  
Abracadaniel|  ...turn and push, turn and push. Well, I'm going back to my cave to wait for someone to kill me. Goodbye.
Finn|  Wait! Abracadanny, don't you worry about a thing. I'm gonna protect you.
Abracadaniel|  You will?
Finn|  Yeah, man. Also, I have an idea for how you can help me save PB's lips.
Abracadaniel|  Oh, okay.
Ice King|  Yeaah!
Finn|   Cheating!
Finn|  He's using a weapon!
Jake|  Why isn't the Grand Master Wizard seeing this?
Ice King|  Nun-chucks vanish!  Boo yah!
Finn|  Now's my chance to stop him.
Finn|  Huwahh?!
Abracadaniel|  Rock Wizard!
Rock Wizard|  Arrgghh! Come to me, meteor shower! Rock Wizard compels you!
Abracadaniel|  Cantrip!
Rock Wizard|  Huh?
Finn|   No!  Jake, two o' clock!
Finn|  Okay, now to stop the  Ice Kiiing...?
Abracadaniel|  My body is squishy. That's how I survived.
Finn|  Whoa! That's turbo amazing!
Finn|  Stay close to me, Abracadaniel.
Cyclo|  What?! You turned me pink, bro!
Grand Master Wizard|  Three wizards remain. Time to get real. I wanna see some crazy wiz biz!
Ice King|  Wiz biz! Wiz biz! Oh, I can almost taste those sweet lips. 
Finn|   Quick, listen! Now's the time for you to help me. 
Ice King|  Hey, guys. Guys? What are you whispering? Come on! I gotta a surprise for yous fools.
Ice King|  Yeah. That's right. Just a little closer.  Ooh, what's in here? In my little sleevey hole? 
Finn|   Watch out, man.
Ice King|  Whoo!
Finn|  You got this, Danny boy!
Ice King|  My nun-chucks! Nooo!!
Abracadaniel|  Yes!  I did it! I really did it. I'm a true wizard.
Ice King|  I have powers too, you butts! Yahh! Ice sword!  Ice Shield! 
Abracadaniel|  Abracadaniel! 
Ice King|  Wha? What you say?  B'oh! 
Finn|  Good job, Danny. You're not a wimp anymore. You should feel pretty good.
Abracadaniel|  I do. I feel real good.
Finn|  I'm gonna forfeit now. I only wanted to stop the Ice King.
Jake|   Uh-uh.
Finn|  I forfeit! I forfeit, everyone!
Finn|  Meow.
Jake|  Whoa.
Grand Master Wizard|  Abracadaniel wins! You are the greatest wizard in Ooo!
Abracadaniel|  Oh, w-w-well thank you, Grand Master Wizard. I guess through this trial I have become a great wizard. I, I came here with no self-esteem and no chances, a will-o-wisp of a boy, but I walk out this arena a man. A confident man! Who deserves a kiss from a princess!
Finn|  NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Grand Master Wizard|  It appears you have knocked out Abracadaniel using the most shameful of all magic, a power shriek.  But since you are the last wizard, you are the winner of Wizard Battle.  Go get ready for your kiss, champ.
Finn|  
Jake|   Wow, man.
Finn|  What?
Jake|"  I've never heard you scream like that before. You were all like, ""Nooo! No one kisses her but me!"""
Finn|  Yeah, okay! I want to kiss her, alright? You got me! The big secret is out! Okay, Jake. I like Princess Bubblegum! ARE YOU HAPPY, JAKE?!
Finn|  Whoa, Jake. Don't cry, man. I'm not really mad at you.
Finn|  I'm just sick of having to hide my feelings all the driz. It's exhausting.
Jake| Then stop hiding you feelings, man! Go out there, and smooch it up! 
Finn|  Heh heh. Yeah, alright, man.
Grand Master Wizard|  You ready in there?
Finn|  Yeah, I'm coming!
Finn|  Ooh, whoa!
Finn|  Oh, dag.
Princess Bubblegum|  What's going on here?
Finn|  Uh, Ice King was cheating his way through Wizard Battle using nun-chucks, so Jake and I faked being wizards to save you from having to kiss him and we uh,  I dishonored Wizard Battle.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, Finn, ...you did all that for me?  That's for being sweet.  And that's for cheating. Finn, you know better than to ruin the sanctity of Wizard Battle. Wizards only, silly. Okay, everyone! Go home! Start getting ready for next year!
Finn|  Heh heh, oh, well.
Jake|  Good job. You got the kiss, man.
Finn|  Thanks, man. My face hurts a little.
Jake|  Don't worry about that, 'cause you look totally cool right now.
Finn|  Thanks, dude.  Here, you try 'em.
Jake|  Okay, am I cool now?
Finn|  So fly.
Ice King|"   How 'bout me? Put me on the grid, scale of one to ten. One is ""totally gross,"" ten is like, ""Dang, Ice King. You look crazy sick."""
Jake|  You gonna do the thing again?!
Finn|  Yeah, man!
Finn|  Whaaaat?
Jake|  Nice.
Finn|  Hey, Princess Bubblegum. Hey, everybody.
Jake|   Man...  Dancin' is rough!
Finn|  Yeah... I'm havin' some sweat issues here! I'll go get us some snackety-juice.
Jake|  Hey, man. I'm Jake.  I'm Jake.  Hmmmm...
Finn|  Check it out, Jake! I got us some peanuts. And punch! 
Finn|   Choking!! Don't give up on me, man!
Candy Person #24|  Whoa, Finn, nice book.
Finn|   Yeah. 'S pretty cool. It's the Enchiridion—the hero's handbook.  Hey, guy, you alright?  Haha. He's all good! Everybody get back to your dancin'!
Jake|  Uh, Finn? I think that bear is followin' us home.
Finn|  Whoa. Haha. I think you're right. Hey, bear, you gonna come hang out with us?  Whaddaya say, bear?  Heh-heh. Awesome.
Jake|  I dunno, Finn. This guy seems kinda weird.
Finn|  Yeah. He's totally weird. Hahaha! 
Jake|   Mmmmm...
Finn|  Jake! Hey, Jake!  Jake!
What?|  Jake
Finn|  Come here! Ya gotta check this out!
Jake|  Eh, okay.
Finn|  Check this out, man. This bear is tops blooby!  Watch this.  Ya gotta try this, Jake. He does everything I do!
BMO|   Oh, stop! 
Finn|  Haha, come on, Jake, try it!
BMO|  It's awesome!
Jake|  Heh-heh. Um... Yeah, okay.  Sweepy-sweepy-sweepy. Sweep sweep sweep. Sweepin'!
Finn|   He's got me down pat! Heh-hah! Sweeping's weak.
Jake|   Mmmmmm...
Bear|  Sweeping weak.
Finn|  Whoa! This guy's alright!
Jake|  This guy just busted me up my chops, Finn!
Finn|  Hey, come on, he's just a bear. He don't know nothin'.
Jake|  Mmmm... Yeah, I guess. Well, anyway, it's gettin' pretty late. Probably time for everyone to go back home to their own houses.
Finn|  Yeah, I guess you're right, Jake. It is pretty late. He should probably stay here tonight.   You can sleep in the bathtub!
Bear|  Braaaathtub.
Finn|   Brathtub, hahaha! This guy's tops blooby!
Bear|   Whaaaat? Hey, Princess Bubblegum. Hey, everybody.  Whaaaat? Hey!  Hey, Princess Bubblegum! Hey, everybody!  Whaaaat? Hey!
Finn|  What are you doing?!
Jake|  Shhh. Come with me. Ya gotta see somethin'. This bear's wiggy, Finn. It's wearing your clothes and dancin' around all crazy.
Finn|  That sounds rad, man.
Jake|  What?! No—Just—! ... Rrrr! 
Jake|  Aw, man!  Oh, ya gotta believe me, Finn. I swear, he was, like, all wigged-out, was dancin'... 
Finn|  ...I do believe you.
Jake|   Oh.
Finn|  It's just, y'know, who cares? Dancing, wearing clothes... He ain't hurtin' nobody. He's just doin' it up, y'know? He's just cool, and he likes my style. That ain't a crime.
Jake|  No.  I guess not.
Finn|  Okay. Great. I'm going back to bed. You comin', smart guy?
Jake|  Yeah, okay. 
Jake|  You're not even a little weirded out by this?
Finn & Bear|   No, man. He's just doin' his instincts. He's like a parrot or chameleon or something. He's funny!
Finn|  Anyway, I gotta go pick up BMO from soccer. I'll be back soon. And remember don't eat my special Finn Cakes. Finn only.
Jake|  Yeah, I get it. You don't need to tell me that every time you make Finn Cakes.
Jake|  Hey, what are you doin'?!  Why, you little...! Tryin' to set me up, eh? You think you're so smart, but this time, I'm ready. 
Finn|  OH, MY GLOB, WHAT?!?! JAKE! YOU ATE ALL MY FINN CAKES! WHAT THE STINK!
Jake|  Uh, nope. The bear did it, and I've got proof. I taped the whole thing.
Finn|   The bear ate all my cakes, and you just sat there and watched him do it?! What's wrong with you?!
Jake|  Ju— What?! No, man, he was tryin' to frame me, Finn! He's tryin' to steal your identity! Why can't you grok that?!
Finn|   He's a bear, Jake! He's a wild animal! He doesn't know things! He just does stuff! He's cool!
Jake|  Ohh, fine, then that's just great. Then you and M.C. Cool Friend can go stink it up together at your stupid cool Finn party all by yourself, cause I'm not going!
Finn|  ...Wait. What? What party?
Jake|  What? Your party, man. Tonight? In the woods?
Finn|"   ""Finn'z... bezt... party?"" But... I didn't make this flyer."
Jake|  Huh?! Well, who did, then?! 
Finn & Jake|  The bear.
Jake|  ...I knew it.
Jake|  See, dude? He's not just jackin' your style. He's jackin' your whole you! Jackin' yo you up!
Finn|  What the what?
Jake|  He got in close and used you. Now he's feedin' nuts to your ex-girlfriend!
Princess Bubblegum|   Sure! I'll have another...   ...peanut.
Finn|  She's not my...  We never went steady.
Jake|  He's trying to replace you, and he's already got everyone convinced he's you! He didn't really like you.  He used you.
Bear|  Tops blooby! Tops blooby. Tops— 
Finn|  Not cool, man.  You're not me. You're just a bear acting like me.   It's okay, everyone. The imposter is gone.
Princess| Bubblegum Finn... nobody really thought the bear was you.
Finn|   Wait... what?
Princess Bubblegum|  We just thought it was one of your jokey-joke-jokes. 
Finn|  Hey! Hey, bear!
Jake|  Wait up, guy!
Finn|  Hey. I... I didn't mean to make you feel so bad about yourself. I'm really sorry about that.
Jake|  Me, too.
Finn|  But... you're a super-rad bear, so... why not just be you?
Bear|   I... want... be... hero... like... yooouuuu!
Finn|   Awww...
Jake|  I guess he's got a heart of gold after all.
Finn|  Hold on, bear. I got something for ya. It's the Enchiridion, the hero's handbook. Everything you need to know about being a hero is in this book. Take it, and learn.
Jake|   Finn, are you nuts?! We can't give that book away! It's, like, crazy-important!
Finn|  Whatever, man. We never use it, except for, like, sitting on it when the grass is wet and stuff.  Drink your fill of knowledge. Someday, you'll be a great hero.
Bear|  Thank you, Finn. Thank... yooouuu...
Voice|  Did you bring the book?
Snail | Yessss... One step closer.
Princess Bubblegum| And here at this site, my Great Uncle Gumbald cut down all these taffy trees in a single night.
Finn| 'Cause those trees were evil... right, Princess Bubblegum?
Princess Bubblegum| Nah. Hey, but I bet they have a ton of stories about your human relatives.
Finn| Um... not really. I've never even met any other humans. If I think about it too much, I get all soul-searchy and weeeeiiirrrd...
Princess Bubblegum|  Ohhh, boy... I've made things awkward. Well, let's forget about that. I brought you guys here because I need you to rip out all these stumps!
Finn|  Okay... I guess so...
Jake| Yeah, man, it'll be fun!  Toss the Jake-sploder!  Nyeeeeh, boom!
Finn|  SPA-MOW!!
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm glad to see you out of that funk... about being the only huma...  I mean...  Well! I'm gonna scram! No hard feelings right? 
Jake| Again, man!
Finn|  Huck!
Jake| Ow!! Whoa... I don't think this is a stump.
Finn|  Huh?  It's a hatch.
Jake| A hatch?  We should check it out, ya think?!   Waaah!
Finn| Heh-heh.  S'dark, huh?  Whooooooaaaaaa!

Finn|  Don't be scared, c'mon.  Yeah, it's okay.  Your... your face! You're...  JUST LIKE ME!!  Hey, wait!
Jake|  Shh. They're startled. Ya gotta be gentle with wild animals.
Finn| I don't think they're animals, Jake. I think... this could be... a tribe of... humans!!  What are these guys doing down here in this crummy hole?
Jake| I don't know, man. Maybe they just don't know any other thing.
Finn|  Hey, fellows! Don't you wanna get out of here?! I could take you to see the sun!  Suuuun. Suuuun.
Susan| Suhhhn... Ow la koo sow suhn.

Susan|  Manee mah nuhp lehp!

Susan|  Ohh-ho.

Susan| Mmm!  Now, I gonna get friends. We eat all of Candy Kingdom.
Finn|  What?!
Susan| Oh. No, no, no, no, no. We won't eat red stripe man. Only everyone else.  Bye!
Finn| Susan, no!!  No!!! You can't eat the Candy People!!  Oh, boy...
Jake| So now what? Fight the humans to the death when they attack?
Finn| No, man! They're my peeps! We have to save the Candy Kingdom without hurting them.
Princess Bubblegum| They're gonna what?!
Finn| Don't worry! We have a plan! We just have to scare the humans away!
Princess Bubblegum| Very well. I shall gather my citizens in the courtyard... and you shall see how terrifying the Candy People can be!  Ah-bloo-bloo-bloo!! 
Jake|  They're doomed.
Susan|  Just grass!
Celina| Jus grah...
Jake| Ahh, these candy weapons are too cute to be scary.
Princess Bubblegum| Good news, Finn! I've managed to make my people horrifying!
Finn| But how?! 
Princess Bubblegum| I've disguised them as gruesome creatures, like witches, and ghouls!
Starchie| Starchie's a beelzebub!
Jake| Aw, so cute! I just wanna give them candy!
Finn|  Quick! Show me your scary face!!
Gumdrop Lass 1| Oh, uh...  Rawr.
Jake| I don't think that'll scare anybody...
Finn| NO DUH! She's...um...! She's...  Hey! Princess. I need a little wagon and your biggest roll of wax paper.
Finn| Now, Princess Bubblegum!  Now, Jake!  It's working...
Susan|  Wah!! Just shadows!
Finn| Aw, man! They've learned how to learn! Hide yourselves, Candy People! I'll try to make Susan see reason!
Marshmallow Kid 1| The Marshmallow Kids never run from a scrap!  Come on, fellas!  Today... we are man-mallows!  Huh? 
Finn| Please, fellow humans! The Candy People are no threat to you!
Marshmallow Kids| CHARGE!!!
Finn| WAIT!! STOP!!
Susan| DUCK!!
Finn| MY PEOPLE!!  HUH?!?!  WHA?!?  They're... they're not humans?  Susan?  Susan... what are you??
Finn| Is everyone okay?  Marshmallow Kids?
Marshmallow Kid| We'll just be gooey for a while.
Jake|  Hey, buddy! We did it! Finn? You okay?
Finn| Jake, do you think she was human, or just another wild animal?
Jake|  We're all wild animals, brother.
Finn|  Yeah... I guess we are... brother.
Jake|"  ""I'm not talking today""  "
Finn|"  ""Me too"" "
Jake|"  ""When did you make your sign?"""
Finn|"  ""Last night when I saw you writing yours""."
Jake|"  ""You fancy a wager, buddy?"""
Finn|"  ""Bringeth it on, sir!"""
Jake|"  ""So, what are the stakes?"" "
Finn|" ""Whoever talks first will be really disappointed"""
Jake|" ""Can we use signs?"""
Finn|" ""Yes, but only the ones we write in the next thirty seconds"""
Jake|"  ""What's your favorite part?""   ""... of the breakfast, I mean""."
Jake|" ""the juice?"", ""the toast?"", ""the jam?"".  ""the Tea?"""
Finn|"  ""Hi, Jake"""
Jake|" ""You didn't write enough signs, did you dummy?"""
Finn|"  ""Thanks, Jake"", ""That's funny, Jake"", ""Nice catch, Jake"", ""Go get'm Jake!""  ""You the man, Jake!""   ""I love you, Jake"". "
BMO| Finn, Jake, I invited some Bikini Babes over to dance to this song!  It's my favorite song, it makes me so happy!  Um, why are you not talking?
BMO| What?
Jake|  
BMO|"  Why are you not talking! What happened to Finn and Jake?! You have taken over their bodies!   ""Oh dang"". "
BMO| Oh oh, what should I do?! 
Bikini Babe| BMO? 
Jake|"  ""I'm going in there"".  ""Don't touch my signs""."
Finn|" ""Of course not, man"". "
BMO|  Go away!! Where is the real Jake?! You are doubleganger you- body taker! 
Bikini Babe| BMO, BMO are you home? BMO, we're here to dance with you!  
Jake|  
Finn|" ""Jake, what are you implying? That I would touch your signs after being expressly forbidden to do so?"". "
Jake|"  ""Oh dang, the toast?"", "
Finn|"  ""Jake rules!"",   ""What're we gonna do...""  ""about BMO?"""
Finn|"  ""What?"""
Finn|  ???
BMO| No way fake boys! I am never coming out! 
BMO| Bikini Babes! They're not Finn and Jake! Get them! 
Jake| Ow, ow! Okay fine! Uncle uncle, please stop pinching me Bikini Babe!.
Finn|  Oh, I win!  you're so disappointed. 
BMO| Finn? Jake? For real?
Finn| We were just playing a game, BMO. It all started this morning when Jake made a sign that said-
BMO| Oh, I don't care. Let's just-a party!
Party God| Party, party, party! Ooouuuu! 
Ending credits|" Armen Mirzaian 1977-2013. ""Aw c'mon"""
Finn|  Hey, Jake, do you think you should date someone just like you or someone who’s like your opposite?
Jake|"  I don’t know. I’m the ""first come first serve"" kinda guy. Get in line, ladies! This Rainicorn thing can’t last forever!   I didn’t mean that. Don’t spread that around."
Finn|  So it’s not good to weigh someone’s qualities against your own?
Jake|  Well, no. I mean, if you feel something, you feel something!  It’s not about personality matrixals and charts, it’s all about the bu-bumps in your heart!  You can’t stop the pumps and bumps! Pumps and bumps! Pumps and bumps! 
Finn|  Alright, well, what about BMO and Ice King?
Jake|  What about them? 
Finn|  Would they make a good couple?
Jake|  Whoa! Wait! Did BMO say something to you?
Finn|  No no!
Jake|  Oh, I see. You’re being weird.
Finn|  It’s not that weird! Come on!
Magic Man|  Do what thoust will be the whole piece of Law.
Jake|  BMO and Ice King?
Finn|  Yeah!
Magic Man|  I’m not coming back. 
Jake|  You’re creepin’ me out. 
Finn|  I’m just thinkin’ out loud.  What, can’t think out loud?
Jake|  Oh, is that what you’re doing?
Finn|  Yeah man! Pffft, jeez don’t be judgy.
Jake|  I’m not!
Finn|  Yeah, you are!
Jake|  How could you know that?
Finn|  I can hear it in your tone.
Jake|  You can? 
Finn|  Yeah, wise-guy.
Jake|   Hey, what’s that in your pants?
Finn|   What?! Not again!  Oh. I don’t know.  Whoa, look.
Jake|  Crazy.  Careful, dude.
Finn|  What the--? 
Jake|  What the heck?! Are they alive?! 
Finn|  Hey, are you guys alive?  I don’t know, man, I think they’re some kind of magic toy.
Jake|  Maybe it’s black magic. Maybe we shouldn’t mess with them.
Finn|  No, man, look! That’s you!  You’re totally shedding on the viola.
Jake|  Yeah, that’s good. How many more thingies are in there?
Finn|   Dude. Like a lot. Come on! Let’s check this out at the house. 
Jake|  I’ll make a special spagot  with a new sauce.
Finn|  Sheesh. So many. PB, you hang out with Lady.  C-listers, go back in the bag. 
Jake|   Who’s in the C-list? 
Finn|  Tiffany, Donny.  Well, he’s okay.  Xergiok... a bunch o' these guys!
Jake|  That’s not very nice. 
Finn|  Don’t worry, man. They’ll get involved eventually.
Jake|  Involved with what? 
Finn|  I don’t know. Involved. Check out Lady and Princess Bubblegum!
Jake|   What are they talkin’ about?
Finn|  It’s hard to say, but I think it’s got something to do with Lady being preggos .
Jake|  Whoa! What kinda narrative are you trying to create here?!
Finn|  That’s your narrative, buddy.
Jake|  Alright, well, what else ya got goin’ on?
Finn|  Hmm. Not much really. I got Ice King over here. 
Jake|  Ice King? He’s not C-list?
Finn|   Yeah, well, I saw his drum kit in here. Here we go.  Okay, jam out, little Ice King. 
Jake|   No. Don’t play with that hack. Aww, man. Hmm.  They’ve got good chemistry. Who’d have guessed?
Finn|  Chemistry...
Jake|  Hey, Finn, eat the food before it gets cold.  I made a new sauce! Umm, earth to Finn, are you okay?
Finn|  Yeees.
Finn|  Whoooooa.
Jake|   You’re up early.
Finn|  I didn’t sleep. 
Jake|   You stay up all night readin’ trash books?  I told you, man. Those datin’ books.  That stuff is mess you up. 
Finn|  I’m not reading. I’m playing with the little wees.
Jake|  Oh, let me see little me.  Me look so lonely. Hey, Finn, pass me little Lady.
Finn|  Uh, you guys broke up.
Jake|   Wha?
Finn|  She’s with someone else now.
Jake|   Who?!
Finn|  He’s a cool guy, don’t worry about it.
Jake|   Ahhhhhh!  What the ball, man?!
Finn|   What?
Jake|  What? What do ya think “what”?!
Finn|  Come on, they’re not real, they’re like toys. These guys here, they’re goin’ out.  Pretty serious. And look at Choose Goose and Lollipop Girl. They’re still testing the waters.  But I think things are gonna work out. Check out Xergiok and Turtle P.  Weird. But cool. Right, Jake?
Jake|   I don’t like where you’re going with this. It ain’t wholesome. I’m gonna go to Lady’s for a few days. To clear my head. 
Finn|  Okay. Whatever whatevs.  Weird.  Huh?
Jake|  I’m back! I got over all that messed up stuff you did.  Yeesh. You okay, man?
Finn|  I don’t know.
Jake|  What’s little Finn doing?
Finn|  He’s... thinking.
Jake|   He looks sad. What’s he thinking about?
Finn|  I don’t know. Probably lots of stuff.
Jake|  Where’s little Rainicorn?
Finn|  Probably still crying.
Jake|  Wha?
Finn|  She’s not handling the break-up very well.
Jake|   Aww.
Finn|  PB's good, though.  After little Finn dumped her, she started working out. Looks like she’s really into it.
Jake|  This is messed up, dude. You’ve crossed the line from weird curiosity to some dark messed up stuff.
Finn|   I know!
Jake|   The destruction!  The depravity!  The wrongness of it all! I’m taking that bag back to the cliff where we found it. 
Finn|  No, man! I gotta fix this mess! Look at me, man! I’m staring into the shadow of my darkest mind hole! I gotta help him!
Jake|  You can’t! Just let them do their own biz, man!
Finn|  I junked them up too hard though! I gotta step in!
Jake|  How would ya do that?
Finn|   I’m gonna talk to him.
Jake|  But he can’t hear you.
Finn|  Yeah, why is that?
Jake|  Hmm. Maybe we’re on different dimensional planes and the border between our planes is like a two way mirror. So we can see him, but he can’t see us.
Finn|   Lemme try this. Finn! Can you hear me?  We’re connected! FINN!
Jake|  Try shakin’ him.
Finn|  Why?
Jake|  Maybe we’re vibrating on different intervals. Try shakin’ him at different speeds and see if he responds.
Finn|   Okay. Fiiiiiiinn! Fiiiiiiiiiinn!
Jake|  Now go faster!
Finn|  FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN!
Jake|  Faster!
Finn|   FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINN! 
Jake|  Go slower, he saw you!
Finn|  Okay.  Fiiiinn. Can you hear me?
Little Finn|  Wah wah wah.
Jake|  Whoa! Neat!
Finn|  I made you do those crummy things. I’m why yous guys is fighting. I’m the big you. I came to apologize. I will never interfere with your lives again.  Don’t worry I will take care of it.  Sorry, my arm got tired.  Never mind. It’ll be fine. Goodbye, little Finn! I’m not coming back!
Jake|  Now what?
Finn|   Hey, ladies! This is big Finn! I caused all the problems! It wasn’t anyone’s fault! Don’t be mad at each other! Have a… dance party! Okay, goodbye! I’m not coming back! 
Jake|  Is that gonna do it?  Get the C-listers out.  Good party. Oh, flip!  Look who’s hittin’ it off with the Ice King! 
T.V.| Ugh. I'm covered in noobs.
Lady Rainicorn| T.V., 잘 지내니? 
T.V.|  I've got hunger cranks.
Viola| Hmm? Oh, yes. That's very  interesting.
T.V.| Kim Kil Whan. 
Kim Kil Whan| Hm.
T.V.| Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrraahh!  Mom, when are we gonna eat?! I'm going nuts!
Lady Rainicorn| T.V., 말조심해! 
Jake Jr.| Seriously, Mom, Dad's already three hours late with the food!
Viola| You hush, Junior. You know Dad's a wonderful cook.
Jake Jr.| Viola, when's the last time you even heard from Dad?
Viola| Oh, you know. Dad is... distractible.
Jake Jr.|"  ""Distractible""!"
T.V.| Yeah, I love Dad and everything, but he's only ever met me twice.
Lady Rainicorn| Charlie, Viola, T.V., Jake Jr., Kim Kil Whan, 제발! 너네 아빠가 너를 얼마나 보고 싶어하는데.  
Finn & Jake|  Whoo!
Finn| Whoo! Whoo-hoo!
Jake| Yeah, yeah, yeah! We're real late! Happy birthday, puppies! Okay, so, putting it out there—I didn't remember to bring you guys any birthday presents, but I did bring lunch!  It's macaroni salad.
Viola| Dad, you're beautiful!
Kim Kil Whan| Dad! We have new business to discuss.
Jake| Happy birthday, Kim Kil Whan.
Kim Kil Whan| Birthdays are old business. 
Jake| Whoa, neat. Um, well, how are things going, Son?
Kim Kil Whan|" ""Things""? ""Things"" have switched hands."
Jake| Heh.  I get it.
Kim Kil Whan| Dad, when I say that things have switched hands, I mean to say that things you have previously claimed ownership of have transferred from your hands to my hands, in that...  I bought your tree house.
Jake| What?!
Kim Kil Whan| What the deed to your tree house. How acquired through legal trade. From whom the deed's previous owner, Marceline The Vampire Queen...  in exchange for one lunatic bass.
Kim Kil Whan| When effective immediately.
Jake| But, Son, why?
Kim Kil Whan| We will convene at the property.
Kim Kil Whan|  Sorry I'm late. Okay, so, as the deed-holder of this tree house I am now your landlord.  The first thing I'm going to have to do is assess your treasure room. 
Jake|  But son!  What would your mother say? Doing this to your poor Pip-Pop!
Kim Kil Whan| I'm sorry Dad. Deeds don't bleed. 
Jake|  Okay son. Get ready to be glitter-stunned by all this treasu--Oh, yeah. We spent all of it.  All we have left are these vintage photos I got at the flea market. They're interesting!
Kim Kil Whan| Woof.  All right.  So I guess this is the apartment the two of you can afford. It's a ladder.
Kim Kil Whan|  Yeah? Yeah. Send them on over.  Sorry about that.  Anyway, as you can see, this beauty offers direct first and second floor access. Superb craftsmanship and etcetera. I suppose you're familiar.  Yes, Finn?
Finn| Yeah, uh, when are we going to get our house back?
Kim Kil Whan|  What?  Excuse me.
Kim Kil Whan|  Good afternoon! Yes, right this way.  I've got 37 available units to show in this building so we're going to want to get right to it. Please step inside.  There you go. Is that everyone? Good, good. Please make your way upstairs and we'll begin the tour.  And you two make yourselves at home. Rent's due on the first, no overnight guests. Oh, and flush once after you boom-boom but before you start using the TP, and then once more in the middle of using the TP if you're going to use a lot. It's easier on the pipes. Okay. Call me if you need me. 
Jake| Hey Finn. I'm real sorry about this. Somehow I feel like it's kinda my fault.
Finn| Nah man. It's really not so bad. Let's just sleep on it tonight. 
Jake| You're gonna sleep... like that?
Finn| Yeah, man. It's tough. I'm a tough kid.
Jake|  I promise, I'll work this thi--Aaah! 
Creature| Gee but it's great to be back home, eh Mr. B? 
Mr. B| Haha, yeah. I can't wait to wash my gross, fat butt. 
Goblin|  Oh, oh holy cow. Oh, oh boy, please hurry. Yes, he's inside my apartment right now! Oh, I'm so scared!
Jake|  Hey buddy, you okay?
Goblin| Glob, now there's two of 'em!
Jake|  I just feel if we're patient this whole thing will work itself out before you know it.  Haha! See, man? Help is on the way!
Finn|  Man, can I tell you something? I don't even know what's going on here. I mean like, what the heck is a deed? How come he can buy our house when it's OUR house and Marceline gave it to us and we live there?! A-and now we're arrested?! This is crazy! It's crazy!! 
Jake| Man, don't you know? The laws ain't made to help earthy cats like us.
Finn| They're not?!
Jake|" Nah, man. Listen. Here on our planet, back in the old days, back in the REAL old days, it was just every man for hisself. Scrooblin' and scrat-scroblin' for the good stuff, the greenest valleys, and scrat-scroblin'. And the strongest, meanest men got the best stuff. They got the green valleys and were like, ""The rest of you, y'all scrats get sand!"" And THAT'S when they made the laws, you see. Once the strong guys got it how they liked it, they said, ""This is fair now, this is the law."" Once they were winning, they changed the rules up."
Finn| Woah, just like Kim Kil Whan!
Banana Guard| Hey, good news, fellas.  Your bail's paid. You're free to go.
Jake| Haha, that's awesome!
Finn| Yeah, awesome!
Kim Kil Whan|" Yeah. Real ""awesome."""
Jake| Hey, Kim Kil Whan! Aw buddy, I knew you'd come around!  Haha, fathers and sons, man. That's that REAL thick chowder.  What's this?
Kim Kil Whan| This is a bill for the bail I just paid.
Jake|  Ooh. 
Kim Kil Whan| You're really in it deep here, Dad. It's time for you to get real, get a job. No more games.
Jake| Come on, son! Just let me do the-- 
Jake|  Man, where did I go wrong?
Finn| I don't know. But I'm not tryin' to be sleepin' on a ladder anymore, so let's just get a bunch of scroot together and buy our house back. Then you two can hash it out later.
Jake|  Yeah, you're right. So, wanna rob a bank or somethin'?
Finn| Well, actually...I was thinking maybe Kim Kil Whan was right.  Maybe we should get jobs or somethin'.
Jake| Oh yeah.... Yeah. Oh no, wait! I just remembered I buried a ton of gold in the front yard!
Finn| Yuss!!
Kim Kil Whan|  Oh yes, yes, absolutely. Small pets are allowed with an additional deposit.  Excellent.
Finn|  Watch it!
Kim Kil Whan|  Excuse me. 
Breakfast Princess| We are delighted to host this year's Princess Day in Breakfast Kingdom! Please enjoy the continental breakfast expertly prepared by our Breakfast Chefs. Now, on to more pressing matters. Brigands have been attacking our western seaports, dozens of unregistered princesses roam the land, and trade deficits are at an all-time high. Historically, Breakfast Kingdom has traded one sack of sugar a month to Slime Kingdom in exchange for four eggs, but egg production has plummeted!
Slime Princess| I can't just pop out eggs on command! I'm an artisan!
Breakfast Princess| You have an egg in you right now.
Slime Princess|  How dare you?
Muscle Princess| Yeah, and what about that peanut juice, Peanut Princess? My body needs juice!
Peanut Princess| I'm not giving out a single drop of nut butter. Not until Raggedy Princess pays me!
Raggedy Princess| Fine! Take it!  Take all my socks!
Peanut Princess| You still owe me a pair of jorts!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Aaah!  You guys, I'm bored out of my face! I make a motion to stop talking about dumb stuff that's lame!
Breakfast Princess| Oh, Lumpy Space Princess, I'm afraid you'll have to be patient with us and our petty disputes. Not all of us have achieved the self-sufficiency that I assume you have in your kingdom.  Oh wait, that's right. You don't have a kingdom! You live in a box in the woods.
Lumpy Space Princess| It's not a box. It's a rotting log.
Breakfast Princess|  Sorry, LSP, but the chair only recognizes real princesses, not bums.
Lumpy Space Princess| What?! I'm like a cool hippie!
Breakfast Princess| Whatever, freeloader. If you were invited to Princess Day, it must have been a mistake or as a joke. Am I right, girls?
Strudel Princess|  Ohh!
Lumpy Space Princess| The joke's on you because I wasn't invited. I'm crashing! And I already ate a bunch of your food! What you gonna do about it, Princess Egg Breath?
All| Ooh!
Cinnamon Bun|  That's true. She does have egg breath.
Breakfast Princess| Okay, you've wasted enough of our time. Guards, take this pamplemousse out of my sight.
Lumpy Space Princess|  You didn't!  Don't touch me! 
Marceline| Hmm.
Breakfast Princess| Okay. Now that the wannabe's gone, let's get back to princess business. O-Oh, n-not you, Princess Business. Uh, princess business. No, sounds the same. I'm sorry.
Marceline|  Hey, you want to ditch this jazz?
Princess Bubblegum| I'd love to, but I'm really invested in this crossword puzzle.
Marceline| Figs.
Princess Bubblegum| Hmm.
Marceline|  LSP, wait up!  Whoa.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Lousy Breakfast Princess. Pamplemousse. What is that even?
Marceline| Yo, LSP.  Sick tag.
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh. Thanks?
Marceline| You know, I like your vibe, dude. You don't take anyone's sass.
Lumpy Space Princess| Yeah, especially not from that gross pile of greasy hash! She lumpin' humiliated me!
Marceline| Listen, let's get even. Teach Old Greasy Locks a lesson. 
Lumpy Space Princess| You're bad.  And I like it!
Lumpy Space Princess|  This place is huge! 
Marceline|  This place smells like butter, bacon, sausage, and juice.
Lumpy Space Princess| Gonna mess with Breakfast Princess, 'cause she called me pamplemousse.
Marceline|"  ""Yobo, Peebocheeks. Just kicking down the town with LSP-boos. She is acting sooo bad."""
Princess Bubblegum|"  ""Ha. Just don't let her get out of control."""
Marceline|" ""Too late. LSP is really doing it up right now. And I'm just feeding the flames."""
Princess Bubblegum|" ""Nooooo"" exclamation point, exclamation point, exclamation point!"
Lumpy Space Princess|  Look. There. Breakfast Princess' room.
Marceline| How do you want to get past the Maple Man?
Lumpy Space Princess| I'll show you, hon.  Ooh! Aah! Hey there!  Yeah, look over here!
Syrup Guard| What? 
Marceline| Nice distraction.
Both| Right on. 
Marceline|  Ugh. I can't digest syrup.
Lumpy Space Princess|  That's for poisoning my girl.
Marceline| Stop! Okay, just one more time.
Lumpy Space Princess|  I thought you were bad. Bad people don't stop.
Marceline| Let's don't stop inside. 
Both| P-p-p-payback!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Ugh. All her clothes are sticky. 
Marceline|  And her taste in music is terrible.  Check it out. I hate this album, but I'm taking it anyway.
Lumpy Space Princess|  That's messed up!  This'll teach Breakfast Princess. 
Syrup Guard #2|  Huh? Jerry!  Who did this to you, Jerry?
Jerry| I don't know, but they got past me.
Marceline|  We're busted. Turn invisible!
Lumpy Space Princess| I can't.
Marceline| Well,  hide then.
Lumpy Space Princess| Uh..Hide where? 
Syrup Guard #2|" I know somebody's in here. I-I heard someone say ""where.""  Getting close now!  No sign of the intrud..er.  Aah! My eyes!  Oh, smells like grapefruit."
Both| Yeah! 
Syrup Guard #2| When I recover my sight, I'm going to imprison you, you giggling girls!  Aah!
Lumpy Space Princess| I got this. 
Syrup Guard #2|  I don't see them.
Both| Hey. 
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, glob. 
Both| He's okay!
Syrup Guard #3|  Other Jerry, what happened?
Lumpy Space Princess & Marceline| Yeah! 
Breakfast Princess|  Okay, let's take a lunch break, everybody.  Oh, when I mean lunch, I, of course, mean breakfast.
Syrup Guard #4| Your highness. There are vandals ruining the castle. They are bad.
Breakfast Princess| Okay, I'll handle it.  Fellow princesses, I got to deal with matters of state. My little sister, Strudel Princess, will take over for me.
Strudel Princess| Eat the berries, dip them in the syrup, whoop whoop, want me to show you how?
Both| Whoo!
Lumpy Space Princess| A squirrel taught me how to do that.
Marceline| That's awesome.
Breakfast Princess| Stop right there! 
Marceline| Hey! Calm your lumps.  It's okay! She's just dazed. I'll handle it.  Come on.  It'll be okay, dude. Girls like us just got to stick together.
Breakfast Princess| LSP, is that you?
Lumpy Space Princess| Oh, glob, no. Not even. 
Breakfast Princess| What's this for?
Lumpy Space Princess| For digging. Now start building a sand castle.  Don't stop digging or we'll know! 
Both|  Whoo! 
Marceline| Yeah.
Lumpy Space Princess|  That was totally fun being bad with you, Marcy.
Marceline|  Yeah, that was pretty rad.
Lumpy Space Princess| Do you think, like, doing all that bad stuff makes us...like, bad people?
Marceline| Uh...probably not. I don't think there are bad people. I think good people do bad stuff sometimes, and, oh, that's bad. But only if you do it once, it's just a mistake, and...that's not bad. I think.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Word.
Marceline| But...I mean,  I do think it was wrong to steal this CD.
Lumpy Space Princess| Yeah, I feel kind of bad about that.
Marceline| We should probably mail it back to her.
Lumpy Space Princess| Yeah. Good call. I—Oh my glob! 
Both|  Pow!
Strudel Princess|  -Couldn't get up from the bed. I was lazy, and that's why I can't have frosting anymore. Okay, so does everybody have what they want? 
Slime Princess| Wait, I think I'm ready to pop it. 
Strudel Princess| Happy Princess Day! 
Finn| Squish.
Fern| Photosynthesize! Photosynthesize! Photo-
Finn| You grabbing a snack, Fern?
Fern| Yeah. Water and light combine so I can make my own food. In case I don't catch anything.
Finn| Come on, man, don't be so dow-  Hey, I got something!
Fern| Hey, I got something too!
Fern| Nice.
Fern| Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Finn| Pretty weird fish, huh?
Fern| That's me - the dude who dinks it up, just like I dinked it up when you left Ooo. I was supposed to protect it. Instead, it went all crazy. I didn't even help. I just covered myself in root beer and danced around like a dummy. I can't do anything right!
Finn| Hey, stop it. You need a squoze?
Fern| Yes.
Fern| I feel better.
Finn| Sometimes being a good dude ain't about not dinking it. Learn from your dinks. Like, you know my first battle with a giant? I never told anybody this, but-
Fern| You boom-boomed in your shorts. I know. I have your memories.
Finn| Yeah, I boom-boomed. The point is I learned from it, and now I'm Finn. You got to learn how to be Fern.
Finn and Fern|  What's that sound?
Finn| Oh, I bet it's a monster. Let's fight this dude Fern's way.
Fern|  Yeah. Fern's way.
Finn and Fern|  Sweet P?  Whoa!
Finn| Okay, Fern, what do you think we should do next?
Fern| Mm, sever his tendons? 
Fern| Before you say no, it would stop him from running.
Finn| We're gonna handle this librarian style.  Shh. Librarian.  Kiss. You can renew the book and bring it back next week.
Fern|  Library style. Squo-o-oze.
Sweet P| Mm.
Finn| Great thinking, Fern.
Fern| I just copied you. Is that thinking?
Finn|  What up, buttercup? Why you run, pork bun?
Sweet P| The monster!
Finn| Was it LSP?
Sweet P|  The monster that whispers me bad thoughts.
Sweet P|  Mommy and Daddy came to save me, but they said I was imagining things, which was true.
Sweet P|  But last night, I really did see it.
Sweet P| And I've been running and running since then.
Finn| Aww, Sweet P. It sounds like you might just be having bad dreams.
Sweet P| No, I only have one dream anymore.
Finn| Uhh...
Fern| Uhh...
Sweet P|" But the whisper monster is even scarier, saying stuff like, ""Sweet P, you're bad. You always have been bad."" I don't want to be bad. "
Finn| Oh, you're not bad. You're super good. Now, let's get you home.
Fern| But it's getting late, and bogs are super dangerous to travel in at night. Your body will be preserved for thousands of years. No one will ever find you.
Finn| Fern!
Finn| Okay, okay, we'll see you in the morning, Tree Trunks.  All right, bedtime, Sweet P.
Fern| You want me to knock him out?
Finn| Er, not this time. How about a bedtime story?
Sweet P| Yes, please.
Finn| Once there was a kingdom of spaghetti.
Sweet P| Mmm.
Finn|  Punch, punch. Kiss, kiss.
Mysterious voice| Listen to your bones.
Finn|  Fern.
Finn|  Fern!
Fern| Hey. What's up?
Finn|  I heard something. Can you see what it is with your tree senses?
Fern| I don't have those.
Mr. Fox| Uh, can I help you?
Finn| Oh, sorry. We heard you scuttling around and thought-
Mr. Fox|" What? You didn't hear me ""scuttling around."" Foxes are silent hunters. I mean, geez, do you know how rude that is? Ugh. Gonna be brooding about this all week."
Finn| Sorry, man.
Fern| Look.
Finn| Aah! Get off him!
Hand creature| Huh?
Fern| I got him!
Finn| Oh, no. I know where I've seen that thing before.
BMO| Huh?
BMO| Finn, Jake!
Jake| What's shaking?
BMO| You will not believe what just happened.
Finn| It must've been the day that BMO found that little sailor hat. Hold him down, Fern! That hand is the flippin' Lich!
Fern| I know.
Lich Hand|  Yes, child. I have returned once more to-
Finn| Bah! Bah! Bah! Bah! Evil! You're gonna get it for messing with our boy Sweet P.
Lich Hand| That vessel may appear harmless, but he came from me. Once I remind him of his legacy, The Lich shall reign once more. Isn't that right, son?
Finn| Aah!
Fern| Finn!
Fern| Ugh! I dinked it again!
Sweet P|" Why did Mr. Hand call me ""son""? Was that my monster daddy?"
Finn| Okay, delegate, delegate - Fern, stay here and guard Sweet P. I'm gonna try and catch up.
Fern| Don't trust me to guard anything. I'm a total scrub-up.
Finn|  Dude, there's already one Lich loose in Ooo. If Sweet P turns E-V-I-L tonight, there might be a second. I need you here.  You got this!
Fern|  You got this.
The Lich| Quickly, while the boy is gone, we must seek out my Well of Power.
Sweet P|  No! Am I turning into a monster?
Fern| That's the working theory.
Jake|  I can't come to the phone right now. I'm either hanging with Finn, my kids, my GF, or I'm dead. Bye! 
Finn| Hey man, hit me when you get this.  Dude's missing a Lich fight.  Okay, Lich. Get ready to die. Again. For, like, the fifth time!
Finn| Oh, hey, it's this awful place.
Finn| Oh, you're tricky, huh?
Finn| I can hear you down there! Speak up, man. What?
Lich Hand|  You've bested me in many worlds, child, but I always return.
Finn| You're so evil it's boring. You're basic, man.
Lich Hand| Yes. While a mortal world doubts and questions, I know exactly what I am. I am the ceaseless wheel. The last scholar of GOLB. I am your doom.
Sweet P| Skull man!
The Lich| Huh?
Sweet P| I, too, am doom.
Finn| Hey, what's going on up there?
The Lich|  Child, you have failed. The vessel has turned. We reign now as twin kings of ruin.
Finn| Sweet P...
Sweet P| I'm not a king of ruin.
The Lich| What?
Sweet P| I am sweet. You're just a naughty hand.
The Lich| Beast, obey me! Obey- No!
Finn| Eesh.
Sweet P| Hooray!
Finn| You're a natural! But where's Fern?
Sweet P| He wouldn't let me follow you, so I knocked him out cold.
Finn| Yeah, I met my bio-dad once too. He wasn't evil incarnate, but he was kind of a crummy dude. TT and Mr. P love you. That's all that matters. Fern! Sweet P saved me and slew The Lich!
Fern|  That's great.
Sweet P|  You're just a naughty hand.
The Lich|  Beast, obey me! Obey- No!
Automated voice| End of message. To repeat this message, press 7. To save...
Jake| Wha...?
Fern|  I don't get it. Why isn't it working out being myself? Finn's off having fun defeating losers. I can't even guard a baby.
Fern|  It doesn't matter how hard I try. I'll always just be in the shadow of the real Finn. Unless I could become...  the only Finn.
Finn| Uh, yeah, but that's a weird thing to call me.
Jake|  This stinks! Hey, how much longer till we get to the mysterious party?
Finn|  Let me check the spooky invite sent to us by our anonymous host.  Oh. We're here. The party's in that castle.
Finn|  It's for us!
Jake|  What's it say?
Finn|   Wear me.
Finn and Jake|  Wear me? 
Finn|  Hello?
Princess Bubblegum|  Yoo-hoo!  Hey guys!
Finn|  Princess Bubblegum, is that you?
Princess Bubblegum|  Why yes indeed. Although according to the invitation, we're supposed to use mystery names. And mine is Lady Quietbottom.
Lumpy Space Princess|  My name is Duchess Gummybuns.
BMO|  I am Professor Pants.
Cinnamon Bun|  I'm Cinnamon Bun.
Lumpy Space Princess|  What's the name on your invite?
Cinnamon Bun|  Oh yeah! Uh... It's Guy Farting.
Finn|  Prince Hotbod, at your service. 
Jake|  I'm Randy Butternubs. 
Finn|  So... who's our host, anyway?
Princess Bubblegum|  Nobody knows!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Maybe he'll be a steaming hot babe with huge money.
Jake|  Tut-tut, Lumpy Space Princess! What would your boyfriend Brad say?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Brad and I broke up a long time ago, duh!
Cinnamon Bun|  Now's my chance!
Lumpy Space Princess|  No. Way.
Cinnamon Bun|  But I can make you happy!
Lumpy Space Princess|   Puke off!  You big donut!
Cinnamon Bun|  Okay. 
Princess Bubblegum|  Excuse me, Guy Farting, there's an envelope on your back.
Cinnamon Bun|   Where? Where?
Finn|  Here. Let me. 
Princess Bubblegum|   Did you put that enevlope on him?
Jake|  No.
Lumpy Space Princess|  No. I didn't do it, no.
BMO|  No. Uh-Uh.
Princess Bubblegum|  What's it say, Prince Hotbod?
Finn|   Esteemed guests, I am your host. I am a ghost.
Finn|  By the time you finish reading this, I will posses one of you and use your body to murder everyone in the house.
Cinnamon Bun|  We gotta get out of here! 
Finn|  CB, wait! It says anyone who will try to leave will die!
Cinnamon Bun|  Nonononononono! 
Lumpy Space Princess|  He's DEAD!!!
Jake|  Yeaaaaah, right.
Finn|"  Whad'ya mean ""Yeaaaah, right""?"
Jake|   Come on. You don't remember when I pulled the same trick on your birthday?  I used the fake skeletons.  To make you think everyone was dead.
Princess Bubblegum|  It looks real to me.
Jake|   Classic move.
Finn|  Dude.  I swear I'm not pranking you. Cinnamon Bun is dead.
Finn|  The question is who killed him?
Finn|  One of us is possessed by a murderer. And if we want to stay alive, we have to figure out who's hiding a ghost inside their mortal body.
Finn|  BMO! 
BMO|  Ahh!
Finn|  Use your ghost detecting equipment to screen everyone.
Lumpy Space Princess|  I blinked by balls. My eye balls.
BMO|  Hmmm... 
Jake|"  What do you mean ""Hmmm?"""
BMO|  Nothing...
Finn|  Did you see that? 
Princess Bubblegum|  
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh it was Jake I knew it, I knew it was Jake.
BMO|  Processing... Data! 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Ew.
Finn|  Huh?
Princess Bubblegum|  So who's the ghost, BMO?
BMO|  Oh. Um... I don't have a ghost detecting equipment.  I just like taking nice pictures.
Jake|  Let's find some candles. If the lights go out again, we'll be able to catch the murderer!
Finn|  Good idea! Jake and BMO, you check downstairs and we'll take this floor.
Jake|  Okay.
Jake|  Lay truth on me BMO, is Finn pulling some elaborate prank on me?
BMO|  No, Jake. When bad things happen, I know you want to believe they are a joke.  But sometimes, life is scary, and dark. That is why we must find the light. Aha!  Found it!
Jake|  Ooh!  Thanks, BMO! BMO?
BMO|  Help!
BMO|  Jake help!
Jake|  BMO?
Jake|  AHHH!  Oh my crease! Oh my crease! Assemble! Reassemble! Come on you guys!
Finn|  Where's BMO?
Jake|  The ghost got 'im!
Finn|  Don't you mean you got 'im-  Ghost!
Princess Bubblegum|  Guys, if there really is a ghost killer, then we should stay in a group. He can't take us all on if we're in a group!
Princess Bubblegum|  LSP, are you okay? Where are you?
Jake|   It sounds like she's in there! 
Lumpy Space Princess|  I'm DYING!
Lumpy Space Princess|   Ahhh!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Ugh, gross. My lumping body's all hollow now, I gotta put something in it.
Lumpy Space Princess|  So where's the food? What kind of castle is this? It's like a poor people's castle! With no lumping waffles for my dump truck! 
Jake|  Chill out, girl.  You find any candles upstairs?
Finn|  No.
Jake|  Well, I dropped a lighter downstairs, but there's no way I'm going back for that.
Finn|  Uh-huh.  Let me remind y'all that the invite says that the ghost will possess one of our bods.
Lumpy Space Princess|   Not my bod.
Jake|  Someone at this table isn't who they appear to be!
Finn|"   That's right,  ""Jake."""
Finn|  So let me ask you a question only the real Jake could answer. Who is always next to me in my recurring elevator dreams?
Jake|   A half-orc shaman.
Finn|   Okay, you're Jake. So, who else was absent when BMO got nabbed?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh yeah, right! I'm not the ghost! I was in the potty house.
Finn|  A convenient alibi. But tell me this...
Jake|   Why did you break up with Brad? Only the real LSP would know that!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Shah! As if you even know the answer to that, Jake!
Jake|  You're right. I'm just feeling gossipy and I wanna know what happened.
Lumpy Space Princess|  IT'S NONE OF YOUR LUMPING BUSINESS!
Finn|  Sounds suspicious.  I bet you're the ghost!
Princess Bubblegum|  She did it! She's possessed! Tie her up!
Finn|  Oh she is, huh? Well, before we tie up LSP, answer me this...
Lumpy Space Princess|   Brad, he kissed me on the mouth! And I was like 'bleh-bleh-bleh', and then I was like 'Uh, gross. Go away, Brad' and he was like 'obviously you're not ready for me' but what does that even mean you guys? W-What does it lumping mean? 
Finn|   But answer me this, Princess...
Lumpy Space Princess|   What do you want from me, Brad?! You said I was the hottest one, isn't that enough?!  Why'd you have to ...my mouth! 
Finn|   What did I write to you on your Happy Birthday card two years ago? Word for word.
Princess Bubblegum|   Finn, there's no way I would remember that...
Finn|   I remember that. 
Jake|   You're not PB! Tie you up!
Princess Bubblegum|   What! Wait you guys!  Look!
Finn|   A real ghost?!
Lumpy Space Princess|   Aah! Don't touch me! Don't touch ME!
Finn, Jake and Lumpy Space Princess|  DAAAAAG!
Finn|   This wasn't supposed to... ha-a-appen!
Jake|  Aha!  I knew you were pranking me back, you!
Finn|  Yeah... it was all a set up. The doors, Cinnamon Bun's and BMO's. Oh strizz! BMO and Cinnamon Bun should be in the closet over there.  Guys! Guys, guys! C'mon you guuuu-.
Lumpy Space Princess|   OH MY GLOB! I can't take this, you guys.  I'm calling my lumping parents right now!
Finn|  LSP! What's happening!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh my Glob! I'm not ready! Get away!  Oh, gross!
Finn|  Where'd did she GO?!
Jake|   Look!   I'm scared, bro.
Jake|  RUN, HOMIE, RUN!
Finn|  Open it!
Jake|  It won't open! 
Finn|   C'mon!
Jake|   Okay...
Finn|  Jake!
Jake|   Ow, ow, ow! I got a splinter!
Finn|  Jakey!
Jake|  Don't let go, man!
Finn|  Oh no! Your fancy GLOVES!
Finn|   Jake... Princess!
Finn|   YEEAAARGH!
Jake|   Haha! Gotcha, dude! Two for two!
Finn|  WHAT!?
Jake|  I figured out your plan months ago! So I flipped the script. Oh yeah!
Finn|  So everyone's okay.  BMO, Cinnamon Bun...
Jake|  Yeah, see?!
Finn|  Whoa, sick! You can phase people into your body?!
Lady Rainicorn|  당연하지! 난 제이크랑 항상 한 몸이 되는데. 
Lumpy Space Princess|   I'm ready for you now, Brad. Isn't it so obvi? I'm so ready.
Finn|   But, PB. You melted!
Princess Bubblegum|  It was a wax dummy, dummy! Jake switched me out while Lady was distracting you.
Finn|   Wow, you got me again! I can't believe that! With the hair, and the house coming alive and stuff...
Jake|  The what?
Finn|  The walls and chairs trying to eat me and stuff.
Jake|  Eh, nah. You must have been so scared you imagined that part.
Finn|   Uh, no I didn't...
Jake|  Haha, nice try, Finn. Let's get outta here.
Finn|  That one's going in the vault.  Aaaaand... It's gone.
Ice King| Ach! Where the turd is my Demonic Wishing Eye?! Grrrr...  I've looked everywhere! Ugh...
Gunter| Wenk!
Ice King| What is it, girl?
Gunter| Wenk. 
Ice King| You know where it is? Lead the way! Oh boy, this is just wonderful!  Hmnh.  Agh! You just want me to brush you! You know this brush is for princesses only?  Ah, princesses only. No Gunthers!
Ice King|  What are my options here? Hmm. Hm-hm.  Gunther! What is your damage today?  Ooh! Wizard market!  W-I-Z-...
Ice King| Hey!  You're really peeving me off, Gunther! Go stand in the corner!
Ice King| I said stand in the corner.
Ice King| Ugh. You make me sick.  Try not to break anything while I'm gone.
Finn|  Gunther?  Uhhh...  Jake? We gots penguins.
Jake|  Hm-huh? Hmm? Oh, yeah...  thanks...
Finn| Come on, you guys! Get off me, now.  Wah! Wah! Grah!
Penguins|  Wah! Wah! Grah!
Finn| Jake?
Jake| Huh?  Hey!  Now shoo, ya little creeps!  Oh... this is unusual.
Finn|  Glip... driggle!
Jake|  Eh... What's with these super penguins?
Finn|  I don't know! I'm guessing it's the Ice King.
Jake|  Well, where is he, then?
Finn| ICE KIIIIING! 
Ice King| Wizards rule.
Ice King|  Doot-doo, deet-dee-doo. Ah, let's see.  That's the symbol for magic items, right?  Hey, this is the magic items shop, right?
Huntress Wizard| What's it look like, ya donk?
Ice King| I know that, I know! Why can't they write it on the sign, though? Why's it all gotta be secret? Let's just put it all out there, huh? Equal distribution of magic to the people!  No more symbols! No more initiations!  Ya feelin' me, Huntress Wizard?
Huntress Wizard|  You tryin' to get killed, Ice King?
Ice King|" Uh-uh, I was just steppin' to ya, girl, with my intellectual wizard politics.  No, don't go.  Well, ""Swing at every ball,"" that's what Jay T. Doggzone says.  Hello?"
Bufo| ...So then he was telling me to beef in the eye of Glob and stuff.
Laser Wizard| Whoa. Did you do it?
Bufo| Heck yes, I did.
Forest Wizard| Yo, I wouldn't do that.
Laser Wizard| Get over it, man. Don't you want to reach the highest initiation of the secret schools?
Forest Wizard| Of course, man. In shadow, we find the light...  safely sealed in darkest night. So make sure y'all keep it tight. Wizards only, fools.
Ice King|  Keep what tight?
Laser Wizard| A secret you never should've heard, Ice King.
Ice King|  Yo. Guys. Chill. I lost my Demonic Wishing Eye.  Just get me a new one and I'll jet. I didn't hear nothin' about no weird, secret wizard club that I want to be a part of.
Forest Wizard|  Loose lips sink the ships, Ice King.
Bufo| Sorry, man.  Nothing personal.
Ice King| Oh, slid—  You guys!  Ah!  Whoa!
Jake|  Okay, I give up.
Finn & Jake| Gunther?!
Jake|  Nice ice!
Finn| What's goin' on here, man? Call off your super bros.
Jake|  Well, that's great.
Finn| Where's the Ice King, Gunther?  Gunther?! What? Alright.  Whoa!
Finn & Jake| WHAAAA!
Finn| Is this happening everywhere?
Jake| I don't know—lemme see.  Whoop!  Dang!
Finn| What do ya see?
Jake| Hold on.  Oh no! NO!
Finn| What, dude?!
Jake|  Hold on, man. Wait. Oh, Glob! This can't be happening!
Finn|  Tell me!
Jake| Eh, it's over. We've been conquered.
Finn| Who's been conquered?
Jake| Everyone.
Finn|  By the Ice King?
Jake| No, dude! By Gunther.
Finn| Holy shmow! Gimme that!  Gunther's heading for the Candy Kingdom! We gotta save them! 
Jake|  Whoa, okay. 
Finn| Hurry, Jake! Wait—I'm still in my pajayjays.
Princess Bubblegum| Yo, Finn, are you seeing these penguins?
Finn| Yeah, it's Gunther! He's taking over the whole thing!
Princess Bubblegum| Well, he'll have to beat my Banana Guards and my Gumball Guardians.
Jake| That's not gonna work.
Princess Bubblegum| What did he say?
Finn| He says your plan is bunk.
Princess Bubblegum| Well, what's your plan?
Finn| I got a plan.
Princess Bubblegum| You do?
Finn| When we get there, I'll do my plan in addition to your plan. Two plans. Laters.
Princess Bubblegum| Uh, alright, so you're not gonna tell me your—
Finn|  I'm outies!
Jake| You're not gonna tell her the plan?
Finn| No, I gotta be mysterious.
Jake| What? I thought you weren't into Bubblegum anymore.
Finn| I'm not. But this is how I act now with all the ladies, you see? I keep 'em in a state of confusion. That way, I've always got options in case Flame Princess doesn't work out.
Jake| OH MY GOSH! Where is this coming from?!
Finn|" It's called ""future farming."" I read it in that book you have by Jay T. Doggzone."
Jake| Jay T. Dogg—awww, dude! Don't read that book! It's gonna mess up your brain. I keep that book around for laughs. It's all really bad advice.
Finn| Oh, okay. I'll stop it, then.
Jake| No, well... you can still be mysterious—that's fine.
Finn| What? Now I'm confused.
Jake|  Never mind—I didn't say nothin'.
Finn| Hey P-Bubs! Are you ready?
Princess Bubblegum| Yes. The calvary  is standing by.
Finn| Cool. I'm gonna rally some citizens and do this other plan.
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, but what—?
Finn|  Good luck!
Princess Bubblegum| Jake, what's with all the mystery?
Jake| Uhhh...  Oh snap, look out!
Princess Bubblegum| Banana Guards, defend!
Princess Bubblegum| Aw, jeez.
Gumball Guardian|  Evil presence detected. Must defend candy. Dange— aaah!
Princess Bubblegum| You'll never get past these walls... I think.
Finn|  This... is my plan. I got the Candy Kingdom underground to help me collect all the bottles in the land.
Jake| Breaking news that mystery plan of yours is a smash hit.  Because the—of the glass... I guess all they care about is bottles, huh.
Princess Bubblegum| But what'll happen when they run out of bottles?
Finn| I won't let that happen, Prubbs.
Gunter|  We-e-e-e-e-enk...
Finn| Stay back! 
Princess Bubblegum| Wait a minute!  Put away your weapons and we'll get you more bottles.
Finn| Peeb! There aren't any bottles left!
Princess Bubblegum| I have a third plan.
Jake| So, we make them new bottles. Then the Gunthers break the bottles, and then we pick up the glass and make new bottles again?
Princess Bubblegum| Yup.
Finn| What, like, forever?
Princess Bubblegum| Yes.
Finn| Bubb, your plan... bunks.
Princess Bubblegum| Heh, yeah.
Jake| I like it. I got a rhythm goin'! 
Gunter|  Wenk!
Princess Bubblegum|  What? What do you want? I don't—
Finn| He wants to smash the Gumball Guardian's head!
Princess Bubblegum| We're going to make more bottles. Just wait, okay?
Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum| NO!
Gumball Guardian|  Goodbye... Princess!
Ice King| Hey. What's goin' on here? Why's this place all crazy? I was just flying by and—  Gunther! You took my stuff!
Gunter| Wenk.
Ice King| That's bad. You know what you get now?!
Gunter|  Wenk.
Ice King| That's right, you get the squirty-squirts.  Bad, bad. Now take off my Demonic Wishing Eye.
Ice King| Alright, Gunther. Now go home.
Gunter|  Wenk.
Ice King| That's right, walk. And while you're walking home, you think about what you did.  It's getting worse and worse with him. He just—he hates it when I leave the castle. I'm sorry, guys.
Jake| Uh, dude? Where have you been?
Finn| Yeah, and why are you all jacked up?
Ice King|" Heh... well, I got into some crazy wiz biz over in Wizard City. Honestly, I don't even know how I survived. Basically, it was the craziest showdown ever. I— I wish I could tell you all about it, but you know—""Wizards only, fools."" Keep it tight."
Peppermint Butler| Princess, he did it! Root Beer Guy set up the force field!
Finn| But he sacrificed himself to do it.
Jake| It's an ugly scene, man.
Princess Bubblegum| Let me see. 
Princess Bubblegum| Rest in peace, Root Beer Guy.
Maja| Give up now, Princess, and I, Maja the Sky Witch, promise not to completely donk up your kingdom.
Darren| I make no such promise. Darren must feed.
Crunchy| Oh, Glob! Oh, oh, oh!
Maja| Oh, well.  What can you do?
Candy Person| Crunchy, chill. Chill.
Maja| Keepers of the clock, masters of dimension, bear witness!
Maja| By my power, I compel you to converge!
Maja| Past and present, be one. Awaken the terror of a forgotten age in this moment that is all moments in the blink of an eye.
Maja| Darren, the ancient sleeper, arise!
Darren| I had a dream I was fighting an army that could birth new soldiers from their own blood. I was endless. Does that make sense?
Maja| Yes. You want to go conquer the Candy Kingdom?
Darren| What's that?
Maja| It's a place that contains the highest levels of caring and sentimental affection in all of Ooo.
Darren| What is caring? What kind of world is this?
Maja| It's a feeling I use in my magic to give me power. Like this shirt that was once the prized possession of Princess Bubblegum. With the feelings in this shirt, I was able to summon you.
Darren| I don't—walk me through this.
Maja| All right.
Darren| This kingdom of candy...
Maja| Yes?
Darren| I will lay it to waste, turn their people to salt.
Maja| Yeah...
Darren| And garnish a million meals with the salt, which we will eat for eternity.
Maja| That's not my plan exactly, but you'll be fine. I promise.
Darren| I promise, as well, to deliver destruction so thorough that all realities are affected.
Maja| Okay. We'll talk about that.
Darren| All realities.
Maja| Hey! We'll talk about it!
Maja| Break this witch out, Darren.
Princess Bubblegum| How long will your force field hold, Gridface Princess?
Gridface Princess| The sleeper's magic is older than legend. I don't know how he disabled both Gumball Guardians, but at least I know my tech is tight. The field will hold long enough for you to think of a weak plan.
Princess Bubblegum|  Colonel Candy Corn?
Colonel Candy Corn| Uh, yes, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum| Ready the cannons. You got me? If they get through that barrier, I don't want to have to use our ground troops.
Colonel Candy Corn| Will do, Princess. And let me just say... thank you for putting this old crease back in the field. I haven't been the same since my lovely Linda passed away.
Princess Bubblegum| Yeah. Good luck.
Colonel Candy Corn| Oh, I tried dating again, you know? But these young girls think I'm too serious or something.
Peppermint Butler| Why don't you date someone your own age?
Princess Bubblegum|  Peppermint Butler, come on!
Colonel Candy Corn| Oh, women my age don't hang out. Where are they hiding?
Colonel Candy Corn| I need a young girl with an old soul to heal my heart.
Darren| This is taking too long.
Maja| Then do the thing!
Darren| I call forth the Legion of Cadmus, the Dragon's Teeth!
Colonel Candy Corn| What am I supposed to—oh! Party's starting. Load 'em up, soldiers!
Candy soldier| Yeah, just put it in there. I don't know.
Colonel Candy Corn| Oh, dang!
Colonel Candy Corn| Fire!
Princess Bubblegum| Finn and Jake, are you ready to—what the...? Finn?  Where the jam is Finn?!
Banana Guard| I don't know. Weren't they just here?
Princess Bubblegum| What the jam?!
Princess Bubblegum| All right. Finn or no Finn, PB's got to get in that biz.  Hyah! 
Colonel Candy Corn| Why have you stopped firing?
Candy soldier| We ran out of ammo, colonel.
Colonel Candy Corn| That's nonsense, soldier.
Colonel Candy Corn| This is how you defend your kingdom! Fire, you wimps!  Ya-ha!
Candy soldiers| Ah!
Colonel Candy Corn|  For the kingdom!
Candy soldiers| For the king...
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, zang! 
Candy soldiers| ...ingdom!
Maja| Eat it, tranch!
Darren| It's over, Princess. Prepare to be annihilated across all dimensions.
Colonel Candy Corn| Princess! No!
Maja| Wait, Darren! Dial it back. I need her residual feelings.
Darren| What the flip is feelings? Darren only understands life and death!
Darren| Wah!
Maja| What the slizz?!
Finn & Jake| Yeah, boy!
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| Hi, Darren.
Maja| The Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant?!
Darren| Eli, were you asleep forever too? All this stuff is different now. What are we even doing here?
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| Yes, it's been a difficult adjustment.
Finn| Blaze his face, Eli!
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| Yes, master. 
Ice King| Yo! Leave me out of it!
Maja| No! 
Darren| Yeah, right.
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| Finn, his weakness is his brain seed.
Finn| Okay!
Finn| Whoo-hoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!
Finn| Oh, uh!  Aah! 
Darren| Thank you.
Jake| Whoa!
Banana Guard| Well, I guess my kids still have a daddy.
Colonel Candy Corn|  Bam, you dope!
Princess Bubblegum| Party tonight in the Candy Kingdom!
Princess Bubblegum| Hey, where's Finn?
Finn| Hi.
Princess Bubblegum| Okay. Y'all bring food and bevs. Finn, you make the guac, all right?
Finn| I'll make the guaaaaaaaaaaac.
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| Finn! Finn!
Finn| Yo! What's up, APTWE?
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| What do I do now?
Finn| Dude, I don't know. Probably not go back in the basement. You're so big'uns. You should be free, boy.
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| Free to do what? I need psychic commands.
Finn| Can you help me dice tomatoes for this guac?
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| No.
Finn| You see, man, I feel weird giving you orders. You should just do your own thing. Realize your potential.
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| But this is what I am—a war machine who serves its master.
Finn| No, man. You're more than that.  Whoops. I see into your brain, remember? You'll do great. Just go for it. I believe in you, man.
Finn| Oh, word. Thanks.
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| Maybe Darren was right. There's no place for my ancient ways. 
Finn| Don't think like that, dude! Come back and see us whenevs!
Ant| I'm doing this for a reason. What choice is there?
Baby birds| Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!
Mama bird| Must feed babies. 
Sun| Hey! Elephant. I'm more ancient than you. Someday, I will engulf the solar system. What was and what will be are meaningless. Meanwhile, you should wonder are you just a two-headed pile of meat on a crash course with the cosmic dump? Or do you contain the soul memory of a million dead stars? How do you light a candle without a match?
Maja| Hello? Who's that? Why can't I see jack?
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| You bonked your head. You're in a coma, but I can help.
Maja| Um, all right. Are you, like, powerful?
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| Yes. I can fly and do lasers from my nose.
Maja| Okay. I can run with this. Take me to the Candy Kingdom and shoot your laser nose at it.
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| No. I must decide, in this moment, what is best. For now, I am the match and the candle.
Maja| What?
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| I will be your friend and keep you alive, until you regain consciousness, maybe.
Maja| Ugh, that plan sounds like dirt!
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| See through my eyes, Maja.
Maja| Ah! It's bright! Wait! You're the flippin' elephant! You laser-nosed me! Somebody help! Oh, my Glob. Somebody!
Leaf| Well, this wasn't part of my plan.
Caterpillar| Hey, man. I'm gonna eat you.
Princess Bubblegum|" What the...  ""mmmmn Princess Bubblegum, we are starving, immediately send us all of your candy. How dare you, ours, Lemon Grabs.""  Bull gunk! I left them a lifetime supply of candy!"
Princess Bubblegum| Hey Finn! Hey Jake! Can you come up here? I have a job for you!
Finn| Okay!
Jake|  Sorry CB, we'll finish this up later.
Finn|  Hey, Preebs.
Princess Bubblegum| Hey, guys. I got a letter from the earls of Lemongrab. They've gone through all the food that I've sent them.  This case contains precious candy seeds for the Lemongrabs to grow new food.  So, I need you two to deliver these seeds to Lemon Castle. 
Finn| For sure. We'll do it.
Princess Bubblegum|  Good luck, gentlemen!
Cinnamon Bun|  Bye, girlfriend! 
Jake| Hey, Lemongrabs! You home?
Finn| Holy--!
Finn|  Jake? Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!
Jake|  Kiss it!
Finn| Aah! Sorry, dudes--got no food! No... food!  Hey!
Jake| Hey! Weirdos!  Get the birthday cake!
Lemonjon| Are you lemon?
Finn and Jake| Whoa!
Jake| What the thing is up with this guy?
Lemonjon| Does your head come to a nub?
Jake| What?
Lemonjon| You are un-lemon.
Finn| Yeah. Cool, man. Hey, do you know where--?
Lemonjon| I am Lemonjon. I see you made it past our Lemon mmmmmmmeringerie!
Finn| Wait, what?
Lemonjon| They're quite hungry.
Finn| Yeah. What the heck's going on here?
Lemonjon| There is no food, only Lemons--Lemons with bellies empty but for lemon lusts!
Finn| Whatever, Lemonjon. We've gotta give those dumb-butts these seeds.
Jake| Where should we go?
Lemonjon| Mmmmmmmy senses tell me that they're in the dungeon. They've been there for three weeks. Three weeks, dungeon.
Jake| I wonder who put them in there.
Finn| I don't know, but we gotta bust them out! Which way to the dungeon, Lemonjon?
Jake| Oh, cool!
Finn|  Thanks, man!
Jake|  Yeah, thanks, man!
Jake|  Hmmm.
Jake| Hmmm.
Finn|  Yo, Lemon-wipes!
Jake| Yech.
Jake| Um, maybe we should hands... for safety.
Finn|  Yeah, sure!
Jake| So, where'd you want to look ne-- Eeeh!  Uh, Finn?!
Finn|  Oh, sorry dude.
Finn|  Stay close to me.
Jake|  Nope!
Jake|  I think this is it.
Finn|  All locked up!  There they are! Hey, Lemongrabs, we're here! We're gonna get you out, just hold tight!
Lemongrab| Go away.
Lemongrab 2| No food here.
Jake| Maybe the kidnapper's in there, too, coercing them.
Finn| Probably the grossest one of all, too--beet red skin, barf, poopin' all its junk-sculpture.
Jake| Ah, stop, man! You're just makin' it worse!  Let's just get this over with. 
Finn| Lemongrabs, you're free!
Lemongrab| They broke the door! The door is broken now!
Lemongrab 2| FIX THE DOOR!
Jake| Fix the door? What?! What? Fix the door? Fix--what? What's goin' on here? Fix the door. Finn, what's goin' on? Fix the door.
Lemongrab| It doesn't matter anymore.
Lemongrab 2| There is no more candy to hoard. Let them keep what crumbs they find, for there are no crumbs.
Lemongrabs|  NO CRUMBS!
Finn| Are you saying you locked yourselves down here with all the food so you could eat it yourselves?
Jake| You know there's guys starvin' up there?!
Lemongrab| Hmm. No, no. You do not understand. It is not us for whom they starve, but them...
Lemongrab 2| ...for whom they starve.
Lemongrab| Mm! Yes, yes! For the candy food was not consumed--no, no--but was given life!
Finn| Wha--?
Lemongrab| You see, Finn,  when Mother Princess last visited Lemongrab...
Lemongrab 2| ...when she saw fit to create me, Lemongrab...
Lemongrab|  ...she left behind a little something-something the secret formula for creating candy life! She must have meant for us to have it, to keep making more family.
Lemongrab 2| Yes, yes! All her fault!
Lemongrab| What? What'd you say?
Lemongrab 2|" I said, ""all her fault."""
Lemongrab| Oh, indeed! For once we had commenced, how could we desist?
Lemongrab 2| I looked deep in myself and found that I'm a guy who can't stop making candy life from the food he needs.
Lemongrab| Me, too.
Lemongrab 2| It just felt so pretty okay inside, greeting each new placid face...
Lemongrab| ...and hearing each new piercing song!
Lemongrab 2| We used the last of the food to make Plop-Top, here.
Lemongrab| Mm. I thought we said Dump-Dome.
Lemongrab 2|  Who cares anyway? They've brought no food! We're all going to die!
Finn| Look. We brought these seeds.  They're special candy seeds.
Jake| You can grow new food now.
Lemongrab|  Oh, yes.  Hmm, mm-hmm, mmhm. Yes. 
Lemongrab 2| Yes, yes. There we go! 
Lemongrab| Ha-haaa! We'll call you Seed-Wad!
Lemongrab 2|  Ooh!
Jake| You really are gonna die.
Finn| ...and all your boys, too!
Lemongrab| Our... boys?
Finn| Come on. We'll take you to see Princess Bubblegum. She knows more about candy than anyone; she built a whole kingdom out of candy!
Lemongrab| Yes. Okay.
Lemongrab 2| For our boys.
Lemongrab| But first we will notify the children of our impending departure...
Lemongrabs| ...so they won't worry about us while we're away.
Lemongrab| Okay, yes. The hard times are over!
Lemongrab 2| Mmmm, here's the plan...
Lemongrab| We will go to the Candy Kingdom and take all their candy from them! Then we will give that candy precious life and build a candy army so we may then go forth and pillage candy for all to eat!
Lemongrab 2| Now go, young Lemonjon!
Lemongrab| Go! Go!
Finn| What's going on, Lemongrabs?!
Lemongrab| It's all  your fault!
Lemongrab 2|  All your fault!
Lemongrab| We warned you!
Lemongrab 2| We warned you about us!
Finn| Yaaaah!  What the--?
Finn and Jake|  Whoaaaaaa!
Finn| Jake! Are you alright?
Jake| Yeah, but look!  He's heading right for the Candy Kingdom!
Finn|  And he's too big to duke it out with! Unless...
Jake| Giant poison candy aspirin!  I've got this one, but it might be too small.
Finn| No. We'll kick him in his heart 'til he's history. Those must have been Lemonjon's guts we saw before. His heart is his weak spot.
Jake| Yeah, but we'll never find it again in time... unless that's it there  with the juice coming out. Remember all that juice, from before?
Finn| Oh yeah, that's probably it.  Whoaaa!  Oh, man!
Jake|  Tastes like vitamins.
Jake| Are you sure this is it? It's not even doing anything.
Finn| Just smash it already, grandma.
Jake| Right. 
Finn|  Oh, nice one, Jake.
Lemonjon|  Whoa, hold the phone! What is this powerful new juice coursing fromst my core source?  The juice aches. Is this the rumored ache of feeling? The feeling of caring unknown to Lemons? New thoughts emerge! If I act, the Candy People will suffer. If I don't, the Lemon people will suffer. The greater good demands but one course only that I dissolve the bonds uniting me and become component to all!
Finn| Whoa, dang!  That Lemonjon turned himself all up into lemon candy! Man, that Lemonjon's all right.
Princess Bubblegum|  ...and... there... we... go.  All done! The last trace of the candy life formula is out of their heads!
Finn| ...and I snatched this  out of the Lemon castle, boyee!
Princess Bubblegum| Now we all just have to keep a closer eye on those two so they don't get in to any more trouble.
Jake| But how come we don't just fix their hearts like we did with Lemonjon so they're more selfless and less selfish?
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, no, no. Their hearts are fine. They're just like this.
Lemongrabs|  Hmm!
Finn|  Man, I still can't believe Marceline is 1,000 years old and has never seen Heat Signature. This movie is gonna blow their minds.
Finn|  Marceline! We brought Heat Signature.
Marceline|  Woot! Woot!
Jake|  Woo!
Marceline|  Hey, so I want you all to meet Finn and Jake. They aren't... completely lame.
Finn|  Whatup?
Marceline|  Guys, this is Wendy...
Wendy|  Hey.
Marceline|  Booboo...
Booboo|  Hello. Hello.
Marceline|  ...and Georgy.
Georgy|  Hey.
Marceline|  We used to be in a gang together back in the underworld.
Finn|  Hmm. Yeah, that's pretty sweet. Hope y'all like getting your minds blown, cause it's showtime.
Finn|   What is wrong with this couch?
Jake|  Ehh, that made my teeth hurt.
Marceline|  Oh yeah. Sorry, I don't ever really sit on there. I just float usually. We... kinda all do.
Finn|  Aww, what? man, no fair.
Marceline|  Yeah, well, too bad you're not vampires. So, anyways, I...
Finn|  Wait! Hold on just a second.
Finn|  Marceline, we insist you turn us into vampires. Or ghosts, or whatever. We just wanna fly.
Marceline|  All right, all right. Fine.
Finn and Jake|  Yes!
Wendy|  Come on, Marceline! you're gonna turn these goofballs?
Marceline|   Don't worry, I've got something more fun in mind. 
Finn|  Okay, Marceline, we're ready now.
Marceline|  Okay, hold that thought. 
Georgy|  Huhuuuhhuh...
Marceline|  I'm gonna perform the biting ritual. You guys close your eyes and don't open them until I say so. If you do... your heads will EXPLODE! Okay, Finn. You first.
Marceline|  Bite.
Marceline|  Chomp.
Marceline|  Boop boop. Boop. Boop. Okey dokey. All done. How do you guys feel?
Finn|  Pretty... much... the same.
Jake|  My neck sort of hurts.
Booboo|  Don't you feel a little hungry...for blood?
Finn|   I felt it. Jake, do you feel it?
Jake|  Yeah, I could go for some blood.
Finn|   Oh no. Jake. Now we're gonna have to drink blood for all eternity.
Jake|   Yeah, what if we turn evil? I'll hafta start wearing cologne.
Marceline|  Relax, guys. You can satisfy your bloodlust without killing. Look.  You just eat the color. Here, Jake. You try. 
Finn|  Ugh. Come on.
Jake|  Sorry, bro.  Oh, snap! I feel... stronger. 
Finn|  Whooooa... Marceline, can we float now?
Marceline|  Mmm... Not yet. That's a really advanced power. First, you gotta go through vampire orientation.
Georgy|  Huhuuuhhuh...
Marceline|  Think you chumps can handle it?
Finn and Jake|  Oh, baby, yeah, baby, baby, baby, yeah, baby, yeah, yeah.
Marceline|  Okay, guys, the first phase of vampire orientation is learning...  ...invisibility. 
Finn|  
Marceline|  Ah! Hey! 
Marceline|  You ready for the power of...invisibility?
Finn|  With all my heart.
Marceline|  Good. Now, spin!
Marceline|"  Give it a whirl, Jake!  Now chant, ""INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE!"""
Finn and Jake|  INVISIBLE!INVISIBLE! 
Marceline|  Yup. It worked?
Finn and Jake|  
Jake|  We're invisible! 
Finn|  You're invisible! 
Jake|  Hey. Then how come we can see each other?
Marceline|  Because you guys become vampires at the same time. So you are forever linked.
Finn and Jake|  AWW YEAH! 
Booboo|   Marceline...you're friends with some real morons. 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, my glob, Melissa. Ever since Clara stopped eating meat, her skin looks so good. I mean, she still looks fat, but like, I can't say that junk to her face.
Jake|  Wow! LSP's a hobo!
Finn|  Let's mess with her.
Lumpy Space Princess|  I'm doing so awesome on my own. Like, right now, I found this can of beans.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Finn? Jake! Put down my stuff!
Finn|   She knows it's us.
Jake|  She must recognize our voices.
Finn|  Let's disguise them.  We're invisible!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Melissa, I have to go. They got into my toilet paper. Melissa, I have to go! 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Give it back, you guys!
Jake|  Weeeee!
Finn|  Yeah! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, Jake!
Lumpy Space Princess|   Nooooooooo!
Lumpy Space Princess|  MY BEANS!!! 
Booboo|  Time to join in on the fun!
Lumpy Space Princess|  You guys ruined everything! I'm gonna kill you!
Finn|  But we're undead. 
Jake|  Geez, we really scared her.
Marceline|  Nice vampire scare, guys.
Finn|  Thanks.
Booboo|  Yeah, pretty good, fellas.  You guys ready...for the next vampire lesson? 
Finn|  You know we are.
Booboo|  Good. 
Finn|  Ow! What's the point of this lesson?
Georgy|  Kick 'em harder! 
Finn|  Ow! It hurts!
Jake|  Ohhh!
Marceline|  Okay, everyone! Stop the toughness lesson!
Georgy|  What?
Marceline|  Finn, Jake. You guys okay?
Finn|  We're okay.  It's all worth it.
Georgy|  See? They're fine.
Wendy|  When did you go all soft? You used to like teaching people about kicks. 
Georgy|  Hey, guys, I think you're ready to learn how to float. All you have to do is jump off that ledge. 
Finn|  Cool.
Marceline|   W-wait! There's more beginner lessons you need to learn before floating. Like... uh... the spooky vampire walk. See? Spoooooky... wooo!
Finn|  Heh heh. No way.
Jake|  We wanna fly!
Marceline|  You guys stop right now.
Georgy|  Marceline, chill out. It's going to be okay. We've got a plan.  Now, get in your flying positions. 
Finn and Jake|  VAMPIRES FOREVER!!! WOOO!
Marceline|  What are you guys waiting for? You said you had a plan.
Wendy|  We do. It's to let them die! 
Finn and Jake|  We did it! Yeah! Woohoo! Awesome!
Wendy|  Way to go, Marceline.
Marceline|  Hey, you guys need to stop trying to kill my friends!
Booboo|  They gotta die someday.
Wendy|  Hey! Let's invite them to our place! When they show up...
Wendy, Booboo and Georgy|  We'll suck their guts out through their brains!
Finn|  Did you see us?
Wendy|  Yeah, you guys were pretty amazing.
Booboo|  Hey, we're gonna throw a party... in honor of your new vampire skills.
Finn|  Holy snaps, that's awesome!
Marceline|  They're lying to you guys. They just wanna suck the guts out of the top of your head.
Finn, Jake, and ghosts|  What?
Booboo|  She's just jealous of you.
Wendy|  We'll see you at midnight at our place. 
Marceline|  Guys, promise me you're going to that party.
Finn|  We're not gonna go.
Marceline|  You're not?
Finn|  Nah. I'm kinda tired from doing vampire stuff all day. We're just gonna chill.
Marceline|  Oh. Okay.
Finn|  Well, we're going back home.
Jake|  Peace.
Finn|  Number 25, Blood Drive.  Hey guys, we're here! Wow! Look at you guys! That's awesome!
Finn|  Uh...  Georgy, what's wrong? Jake, what's happening?
Jake|  I think they're testing our vampire abilities.
Finn|  Oh, sweet. VAMPIRE KICK! 
Georgy|  Aw, come on. Will you knock it off already?
Wendy|  You know you're not even real vampires.
Finn|  Pssh. Then why am I flying, Wendy?  Oh.  Yo, man. I think Marceline tricked us.
Jake|  Yeah.
Marceline|  VAMPIRE KICK!!!  Finn. Jake. I'm so sorry I got you into this. I should've never pranked you so perfectly.
Finn|  It's okay. You're here now to beat up those ghosts and save us.
Marceline|  Oh, no, vampires can't beat ghosts. It's sort of a Rock-Paper-Scissors thing. I just came to apologize.
Finn|  Aw, man.  I can't believe we're gonna die just because we wanted to be comfortable watching Heat Signature. 
Georgy|  Uh... did you guys say... Heat Signature?
Commander|  Have you located the enemy's heat signature, Private?
Private|  Yes, sir. But I also noticed something... strange. Something... I can't explain.
Commander|  Well, spit it out, man!
Private|  I... I... I can't seem to locate... our heat signature.
Finn|   This stink-ups mega bam-bam to the J-stop. Could we just go back to the brain-eating or whatever?
Georgy|  MMM-HMM. After the movie.
Finn|  Well, can't we just--
Marceline and ghosts|  Shhh!
Georgy|  Shut!
Private|   Look out, Commander!
Commander|   Aaaagh! My heat signature!
Jake|  What'ya building?
Finn|  Um, it's just a little stick fort.
Jake|  Oh, rad!
Jake|  Look. It's just my size.
Jake|   Hey, get away from my fort, you big stinky monster!
Finn|  I like it when you get small, Jake.
Jake|  Yeah, me too.
Jake|  Whoa, whoa!
Finn|   Whoa, Peppermint Butler!
Peppermint Butler|  Finn, Jake, the Princess wants to see you.
Princess Bubblegum|  As princess of Candy Kingdom, I'm in charge of a lot of candy people. They rely on me. I can't imagine what might happen to them if I was gone. And after my brush with death at the hands of the Lich,  I realized something.  I'm not gonna live forever Finn.  I would if I could.
Princess Bubblegum|  But modern science just isn't there yet.
Princess Bubblegum|   So I engineered a replacement who can live forever.
Princess Bubblegum|  I call her... Goliad.
Finn & Jake|   Wow!  Aww! She's cute.
Finn|  Hi, Goliad. I'm Finn.
Jake|  And I'm Jake.
Goliad|  Hi, Finn. Hi, Jake.
Finn|  Hi, Goliad.
Goliad|   Hi, Finn.
Finn|  What did you use to make her?
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, um...  Pretty standard candy creature soup.
Princess Bubblegum|  Some acids.
Princess Bubblegum|  Some algebra.
Princess Bubblegum|   And I threw in one of my baby teeth so she had my DNA.
Finn & Jake|  Wow, DNA?!
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeah. All it takes is just one little tooth, or,  a single hair.
Princess Bubblegum|  It's all it takes.
Jake|  Princess Bubblegum, are you okay?
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good. Haven't slept for a solid 83 hours, but... yeah, I'm good.
Jake|  Aw, you should go to bed.
Princess Bubblegum|  I can't go to bed, Goliad has huge, mondo mama brains.
Princess Bubblegum|  I still need to fill them with knowledge...  about how to rule a kingdom. 
Finn|  What? Let us teach her.
Princess Bubblegum|  Uhh, okay. I guess that will be all right.
Finn & Jake|   Yea!  Yeah! Teachers!  Yeah, woo-hoo!  Teach, teaching teachers.
Finn & Jake|  Woow, woow, woow!
Finn|  C'mon, Goliad.
Finn|   See ya later, Princess! Get some sleep!
Princess Bubblegum|  Huh? Whu...? Bye guys...
Finn|  Look, Goliad. This is a preschool. I'm gonna set up some obstacles and all that for you to learn on, is that okay? 
Goliad|  Yeah, thanks Finn. I'm excited to learn.
Finn|  Okay, great. Jake, you go and get some kids from inside to help with the lesson and such.
Jake|  Okay. C'mon, Goliad.
Goliad|  Yes, Jake.
Jake|  Uhm...
Jake|  Uhh...
Red Gumball/Candy Child|   Stinking, durken...
Candy Nanny|  Now, now, settle down.
Goliad|  Jake, these kids seem pretty scary.
Jake| Ah, nah, these kids ain't nothin'! Kids groove doozyploon! Check this out.
Jake|  Hey, there kids, who wants to play--
Jake|  Uhh, easy now children. Easy-
Peanut Child|  Get his brain! Get his brain!
Peanut Child|  Get his eyes!
Jake|  Listen up, you kids better stop donkin' around! You're gonna mess up Goliad!  It's my way or the highway, get it? I'm Don Juan Cherry Tempo! Now march, glib blobbit!
Jake|  Don't be acting all crazy.
Jake|  Wow, holy shmow!
Finn|  Oh, hey, y'all are just in time. You ready to pop this croc's back Dr. Goliad?
Goliad|  Yeah, I think so Finn. I've learned a real lot already so far. Sooo much... from Jake.
Jake|  Uh, you know, Finn... maybe this isn't such a good idea, actually.
Finn|  Oh, no, it's cool. I got helmets for everybody.
Finn|  Okay, Goliad, you ready to lead? 
Goliad|  Ready!
Finn|  Okay, in 3, 2, 1...  Go!
Goliad|  Alright, listen up! You kids better stop dunking around and get on that ramp!
Goliad|  You're gonna mess up Goliad! I'm Don Juan Cherry Temp—  Cherry Tempo! It's my way or the highway, Glob-globbit!
Finn|  Stop stop! No, Goliad, no! Leading isn't about scaring people, you gotta stay calm and use your head. Use that beautiful brain, girlfriend.
Goliad|  My brain? Are you sure?
Finn|  Yeah! Don't be shy. Try it on me, lead me.
Goliad|  Okay, Finn.  Okay.
Finn|   No, Goliad, that's wrong, too.
Finn|  You can't just control people or whatever, it's messed up.
Goliad|  No, Finn. This way is good. Everyone did what I wanted. Really fast, no mistakes, calm like you said. This is definitely is the way to lead. Definitely.
Finn|  Um, no, no. ...Wait, is that true? 
Jake|  C'mon, Goliad. Let's go see Princess Bubblegum.
Finn|  Princess! Princess!
Jake|  Goliad's got mind control powers!
Finn|  She got the wrong idea about leadership!
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, I was afraid this might happen. Where is she now?
Finn & Jake|   She's chilling in the garden!  We left her outside the garden!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hello, Goliad.
Goliad|  Hello, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum|  I hear that you learned a lot today.
Goliad|  Yes, I led the children.
Princess Bubblegum|  But Finn said you used yelling and mind control.
Goliad|  Yes, it was good.
Princess Bubblegum|  Goliad,  let me tell you about leadership. You see this fat bee? It's gentle  and makes the flower happy, and pollinated. They both get what they need... ...and that's how leaders should be.
Goliad|  No, Princess. Bee cares not for flower. If getting pollen hurts or kills flower, bee would not care.  Bee is stronger than flower.
Goliad|  Goliad is stronger than bee.  Goliad is stronger than all.
Princess Bubblegum|   Oh, no. She's too far gone, too corrupted. If we're not careful, she can throw an ultra-tantrum and wind the castle apart. I will have to disassemble her and try again.
Goliad|  No, Princess.   This is my castle now.
Finn|  Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her!
Princess Bubblegum|  No, Finn. She's far too powerful. Here's the plan I'm going to build another Candy Sphinx in my lab. It's the only thing that can possibly match her. Just keep her busy 'til I return.  And don't think about the plan! She can read your minds!
Jake|   Ugh, eyeball... Just tuck that eyeball back in its hole.
Finn|  Goliad, no!
Finn|   Jake, don't swallow!
Finn|  Uhh, you're in Finn's bubble.
Finn|   Don't think of the plan... Think of something else. Think of something else.
Finn|  Don't worry, Princess. We'll stop her!
Princess Bubblegum|  No, Finn, she's too—
Princess Bubblegum|  Anyway, like I was saying, she's far too powerful—
Princess Bubblegums|  Finn, she's far too powerful. Here's the plan.
Baby Finns|  I'm a buff baby that can dance like a man.  I can shake-ah my fanny, I can shake-ah my—Ahh!
Princess Bubblegum|  Here's the plan. I'm going to—
Princess Bubblegum|  Goliad! No!
Goliad|  Wait, brother, why must we fight? Rule with me!
Goliad|  No, brother! Don't you see? They're turning us against--
Goliad|  So be it.
Princess Bubblegum|  Finn, are you okay?
Finn|  Yeah, that dude saved me.
Princess Bubblegum|  That's Stormo, Goliad's new brother.
Finn|  Wha-- What are they doing now?
Princess Bubblegum|  They're about to have a psychic showdown.
Jake|  Wow, man, so, like... I guess they're so evenly matched that it's a stale—  It's a stale— 
Finn|  They're so evenly matched that it's a stalemate!
Princes Bubblegum|  Yes. Stormo sacrificed himself to keep Goliad in check for all eternity.
Finn|  Well, that's pretty cool, but... I don't understand. If Goliad and Stormo are the same, how come Stormo is a good guy?
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, that's simple I used some of your heroic DNA in Stormo's recipe and not Goliad's.
Finn|  Oh, whoa so, that means Stormo is like... my son?
Princess Bubblegum|  Well, yeah... in a way.
Finn|  Happy birthday, Stormo.
Finn|  You got that cooler, buddy?
Jake|  Yup!
Finn|  Good, 'cause we're gonna need it for this... ROOF PARTY!  Watch this, everybody! Triple flip with chips for the dip! 
Jake|  Watch this, everybody! A cooler! With stuff... for the thing! 
Cinnamon Bun|  Finn, you always focus an endless amount of energy on everything you do.
Jake|  What about me? What do I focus my energy on, Cinnamon Bun?
Cinnamon Bun|  Uh, Jake... you don't really focus at all.
Jake|  Huh? 
Cinnamon Bun|  I said you don't FOCUS AT ALL! Hey, Finn, do another flip.
Finn|   YUP! YAH!
Cinnamon Bun|  Hahaha!! You're a dynamo, Finn!!
Finn|  YEAH!! I NEVER SLOW DOWN!!
Stranger|"  ""Never slow down?"""
Finn|  Whoa. Dude, can you, like, get offa' me?
Stranger|   Do you think your energy could be used to power a huge machine?
Finn|  I guess so, man.  Hey, Jake  Your friend is super weird, dude.
Jake|  I thought he was your friend.
Princess Bubblegum|  It's starting, everyone! The celestial alignment!
Finn|   Jake! That party was super fun! 
Jake|  Man, I'm sleepy. 
Finn|  Then go to sleep, man!
Jake|  Huh? Oh, yeah, right.  Goodnight, homie.

Stranger|  Yes, the charismatic stranger from last night! Also...  the Grand Master of the Gnomes!
Gnomes|  Hup! Hup! Hup!
Gnome Ruler|  And...  ruler of the Beneathaverse!
Finn|   'S pretty nice. Hey, why don't you guys just untie me, and we can pretend this whole thing didn't happen?
Gnome Ruler|  Oh, no! I've been searching all over Ooo for the perfect power source! A living dynamo! Something that... never slows down.
Finn|  Uh-oh.
Gnome Ruler|  And last night, I finally found—
Finn|   It's me.
Gnome Ruler|  Yes!! It's you!! You will have the great honor of powering the Upturnoverdrive!
Finn|  That does what now?
Gnome Ruler|  It will flip over the entire world! Then we'll be the ones on top, buddy!
Finn|  THAT'S BIZONKERS!
Gnome Ruler|  Yes, but the engineering is very sound.
Finn|   Huh?
Gnome Ruler|  Your energies will be harnessed by our most advanced technology. The Cyclonic Rodentarod!
Finn|  Ha! You may have captured me... Hugh!  ...but you can't make me run!  Ow! Well... you can't make me run very fast.  OW!! Jake's on his way to mess you guys  UUUOOOOAAAHH!!
Jake|  Fiiiinn!!  Fiiiin!! Fiiiin!?!  Man, where is that kid? I'm really startin' to worry...  Take my sammich, BMO. I'm gonna go find Fi—   A dancing bug!  Hey, man, you're shakin' it all wrong!

Simon|  All finished.
Jake|  Finished, huh?  Finished... Finished... Fin... Fin... Finn...  AWWW, FINN! Darn it! My best friend's missing! I gotta get my head together!  Get undistracted! And use alla' my skills to track 'im down! Smelling!  Touching.  Tasting.  Looking.  Little footprints! Too small to be Finn's... More like a bunch-a'-gnomes-carrying-something footprints!
Long-haired Nymph|  Okay. I've got a joke. What did the mermaid... sea? A movie?
Short-haired Nymph|  Wh-...What?
Long-haired Nymph|  Oh! I messed it up! But it's still funny, right?
Jake|  WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, NO, IT'S NOT!! Y'all are horrible at tellin' jokes. Lemme hitcha with this. Didya hear about the goblin who got his left arm and left leg cut off?
Nymphs|  Um... no...
Jake|  That's okay! He's all right now!!  AH-HAHAHAHA! AH-HAHAHA! AH-HAHAHAHA!! AH-HAHAHA!!
Gnome Ruler|  Now... for the final stage!  The brain machine!!
Finn|  NO.
Gnome Ruler|  YES! THIS MACHINE WILL SUCK THE ENERGY FROM YOUR THOUGHTS!  ...To start our Upturnoverdrive.
Finn|   Don't think, Finn... Don't think anything.  Can't... let... them... WIN!!  He then breaks his legs free.  After a battle cry, Finn picks the entire chair up with a screeching yell and throws it at another machine.] No more games. No... more... PAJAMAS!!! 
Gnomes|  NOOOOO!!!
Finn|  Jake?!?!
Gnome Ruler|  Ahahahaha! It's working!
Crowd|  Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!
Jake|  Yeah!  Yeah!  Man this party is nuts! How'd I even get up here?!
Long-haired Nymph|  You blacked out after laughing so hard at your own jokes.
Short-haired Nymph|  You were off the hook!
Long-haired Nymph|  So we took you to the Cloud Kingdom to party with the Party God.
Jake|  Whoa! Who's the Party God?!
Party God|  I am the Party God!
Jake|  ...Oh.
Party God|  Jake... you have won my favor for being a completely off-the-hook party dog! 
Jake|  Hahaha!
Party God|  And because your gut waves please me so, I will grant you one wish! What do you want most in the world?
Jake|"  ""What do I want most?""  ...What do I want most in the world? Well... I wish Finn would stop leavin' his dirty—  FIIINN!!!! I was on his trail...! And then I... got distracted...!! GAAAH!! What's wrong with my brain?! Cinnamon Bun was right... I can't focus on NOTHIN'!! Party God, I wish that I could focus on finding my friend Finn!"
Party God|  Then your wish is my...
Jake|  WAIT, wait... Is there some kinda catch?
Party God|  Uh...  Y-y-y-yes, y-y-you got me. ...To grant your wish, I will have to fill you with the energy of a thousand partying demons! You will become so overloaded with party energy that you will demolish everything in your path!! 
Jake|  Must... find... Finn! Must... must...! PARTY FOREVEEER!!! 
Gnome Ruler|  It's working! It's working!! AHAHAHAHAH!!

Finn|  Yeah, man!!
Jake|  And you're okay?!
Finn|  Yeah, man, I'm fine!!!
Jake|  Haha! Then I did it! I saved you by being an unfocused, rowdy party dog!
Finn|  Hahaha, yeah, dog!!
Jake|   Hahaha! Yeah!  Let's go eat Cinnamon Bun!
Jake|  BMO, turn the music down. BMO! Turn it down!
BMO|  
Jake|   Come on, BMO you're messing up my game!
BMO|  
Jake|  Hey, dude, can I borrow that paper?
Finn|  Mm-hmm.
Jake|   Bad computer! No! No!  Now go sit in the corner and think about your life.
Snorlock|  
Finn & Jake|  Snail attack!
Finn & Jake|  Aaaaaah! Oof!
Snorlock|  
Finn|  Oh, sick!
Jake|  Ugh!
Finn|  Dude, how do you fight a snail?!
Jake|  Hold on!  I got this!  Don't make me use this, man!
Snorlock|  Salt?! But I heard you guys were heroes.
Finn|  We are heroes. We thought you were trying to attack us. Why'd you break in here all mad, squirting that juice all over us?
Snorlock|  It's not mad juice. It's sad juice. My name's Snorlock, and I'm sa-a-a-a-d! 
Finn|  Stop squirting slime! Just tell us what's wrong!
Snorlock|  I need a girlfriend. I have no one to love.
Finn|  Jake, hero huddle.  What do you think?
Jake|  I think our house is all jacked up.
Finn|  Yeah, but he's just an innocent goober looking for love.
Jake|  Yeah. Okay, let's help him. But he's got to lay off the house.
Finn|  Right! All right, man. We'll help you hook up as long as you—
Snorlock|  Yay!
Finn & Jake|  Whoa! Aaah!
Jake|  Lay off the house, man!
Snorlock|   You guys... won't help me? 
Finn|  All right! all right! We'll help you, dude! Just put our house back!
Snorlock|  Okay! Right after I get a girlfriend.
Finn|  Aw! All right, you big crazy. It's a deal.
Snorlock|  
Finn|  Jake, what time is it?!
Jake|  I don't know, but you're probably going to say...
Finn & Jake|  Lady time! 
Finn|  Okay, Snorlock, if you want a lady, you have to be yourself.
Snorlock|  How do I be myself?
Finn|  Uh, how does he be himself, Jake?
Jake|  Just do whatever you want, man, as long as it comes from the inside.
Snorlock|  Like sad juice?
Finn & Jake|  No!
Jake|  You keep that stuff inside you, brother. You just got to talk to 'em.
Snorlock|  Oh. I never done that.
Jake|  Finn, you see any hot mamas?
Finn|   Ummm... Baaaaaam!
Jake|  Go talk to her!
Snorlock|  Uhmm...
Jake|  Go talk to her!
Snorlock|   Okay.
Snail Lady #1|  Oh!  Hello.
Snorlock|  Hi.
Snail Lady|  Mm. You seem like a reasonable male. We should go to a movie sometime.
Jake|  He's got this.
Finn|  Yeah.
Snorlock|   Uhh...
Snail Lady #1|  I like old movies. 
Snorlock|  Uh..uh uh...
Snail Lady #1|  Um, are you okay?
Snorlock|   Aaaaaaaaah! Girlfriend! Girlfriend!
Finn & Jake|  Aaah!
Snorlock|  Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend! Girlfriend!
Finn|  Dude! our house! We got to do something!
Jake|  Relax. I got it. Snorlock! Hey, Snorlock. You okay, buddy? Went a little nuts there, guy. You got to get that under control, 'cause you're scaring ladies and jacking up our house.
Snorlock|  I'm sorry. Are you gonna leave me?
Jake|  Aw, who could leave you? Come here, you big hot mess. 
Finn|  Break it up, you two! We have ladies to attend to!
Jake|  Yeah, the ladies.
Snorlock|  Talking to ladies is hard.
Jake|  No, it's not. Check it out, Snorlock. Finn, you be the guy snail, and I'll be...  the chick snail.
Finn|  Ugh! gross, Jake!
Jake|  Come on, man. We're just pretending. Do it for love.
Snorlock|  
Finn|  Okay. I'll do it for this guy.
Snorlock|  
Finn|   What's up, lady snail?
Jake|   Well, I'm just sitting here thinking about mating with snails.
Finn|  No! I can't do this, man! I-am-out!
Snorlock|  I'll mate with you.
Jake|   We're just role-playing, buddy.
Snorlock|  Aww.
Jake|  Here, Finn. This time you be the chick and I'll be the snail dude.
Jake|   Hey, baby. What's up?
Finn|  Uh... WHA!
Jake|  Mm-mmm!  mm-mmm!  Girl, you smell good. Did you take a bath in rainbows and cupcakes?
Finn|  
Jake|"  Say ""yes""!  Say ""Yes""!  Say ""YES""!  Say ""Yes""!"
Finn|  Okay! Yes!
Jake|   See, Snorlock? Talking to ladies is easy. Just act like me.
Snorlock|  Uh... girl, you smell good.
Snail Lady #2|  You can smell me?
Snorlock|  May I smell you more?
Snail Lady #2|  Uh, okay.
Snorlock|   Cupcakes...
Snail Lady #2|  Uh, I have to go.
Snorlock|  Did you take a bath?
Snail Lady #2|  Don't ever talk to me again.
Snorlock|  Please don't go! Don't go! Aww.
Jake|  Aw, it's okay, buddy. Come here and give us a hug.
Snorlock|  Man, I wish you guys were ladies.
Finn|  Uhh.
Jake|  Stay focused, Snorlock. You have any cool talents that ladies might like?
Snorlock|  No.
Jake|  Umm, hey, Finn, teach him how to use swords. The princesses always love this one.
Finn|   Yah! yah! yah! yah! Yaaaah! hyah!
Jake|  Do you think you can do that, Snorlock?
Snorlock|  I don't know.
Jake|  Hmm. Maybe you're musical. Can you do this?  Try doin' all that.
Snorlock|  Hmm. 
Finn & Jake|  Whoo-hoo! yeah!
Snail Lady #3|  My word, Eleanor! What is that alluring sound?
Eleanor|  I have no idea.
Jake|  Yeah, Snorlock! Show us that talent!
Finn|  Whoo-hoo!
Snail Ladies|  Oh, my! What is that? What is that wonderful sound? Do I see swords?
Finn|  Jake, these chicks look pretty serious.
Jake|  Let's just let Snorlock do his thing. Go to it, buddy! 
Snail Ladies|   Ahh! Ooh! Ahh.
Jake|  Look at him go! Bringing in the ladies.
Finn|  Uh, he's bringing in a lot of ladies.
Snail Ladies|   Mm!
Finn & Jake|  
Finn|  Snorlock! These ladies are ruining our tree house! Stop!
Finn & Jake|  Whoa!
Jake|  Wedge, dude!
Finn|   
Jake|   It's no use, man. It's stuck with snail slime.
Finn|  
Jake|  Finn! Aah! 
Finn|  How are we gonna get our house back?
Jake|   Dude, I'm going in.
Finn|  Wha? Jake! No! You'll get slimed or grinded on!
Jake|   Hmph!
Finn|   
Jake|  Snorlock, I'm gonna give you till the count of three, mister!
Jake|  One, two, three!
Jake|  Fine. I didn't want to have to do this.  
Snorlock|  Aaaaaah!  Ow! ow! Owwwwwww!
Snail Lady #4|  Oh, my gosh! He's naked!
Snail Ladies|  
Snorlock|  What? I'm naked? But I've never had a shell.
Jake| Snorlock, you never had a shell? That means you're not naked. You're a slug!
Snorlock|  Me, a slug?
Finn|  Yeah, man. That's why you have trouble with snail chicks. You need slug chicks.
Snorlock|   I don't known any slug chicks.
Slug Lady|  Actually, I-I'm not really a snail. I'm a slug. My shell's made of peppermint.
Snorlock|  
Finn|  That's gross!
Jake|  I don't know why they have to make out so close to our house.
Finn|  I don't know. Come on, let's finish rebuilding it. I got some ear plugs you can borrow.
Finn|  Where's that music coming from?
BMO|   Go! go! go! go!
Finn|  BMO! Get over here and help us rebuild the tree house.
Jake|  Yeah. You live here, too!
BMO|  
Finn & Jake|  Oh, BMO!
Jake| Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Lady Rainicorn| 안녕. 
Jake| Hey bear dude, sorry to drop in like that.
Jemraine| Oh, hey... brother.
Jake| Whoa. Jermaine?! We must be dreaming at the same time again.
Jermaine| Yeah.
Jake| I was just hanging out with a couple of ladies outside... or a couple of the same lady. Then bam! Sky-boxed!
Jermaine| Ugh. Jake, I'm here to work. I got to keep everything where it should be. So, uh... so how are you and Finn doing?
Jermaine| Whoop! Ah!
Jermaine| Uh...  Epsilon, eucradies, dernesto... 
Jake| Jermaine? You okay, man?
Jermaine| No, no, I'm--I'm fine. Everything's fine.
Jake| Oh.
Jermaine|  epsilon, eucradies, dernesto...
Jake| Hey, listen, um, maybe we should get together in the  awake world? You know, meet in meat-space?
Jermaine| Uh, yeah. Sounds great. See you later.
Jake| In the dream, Jermaine was wearing a bear suit. I wonder what that symbolizes. Maybe it means Jermaine needs us to visit.
BMO| Workout time!
Jake| You want the can or the cup? 
Finn| I like the can. 
Jake|  Hmm. I'd hate it if my kids didn't ever see each other...  Or if Viola shoved Jake Jr. down a dream hole.
Finn| I don't know. Jermaine's always been kind of a dream hole.
BMO| Whoa.
Jake| We're all getting older. We should go see him now, or we might regret it.
Finn| Eh. It's not a great time just this minute.  Trying to figure this deal out.
BMO| Woah!
Finn|  Okay. Let's go see Jermaine.
Finn| There's a lot more demons here than I remember.
Jake| Huh. Yeah. The only constant is change, bro.
Shadow Demon 1| I want my yo-yo!
Finn| Yo, yo! That's rude, dude!
Shadow Demon 2| Give me my cup!
Finn| Huh?
Shadow Demon 2| Bring me my cup, or I'll skull-cup you!
Jake| Yipe!
Finn| Jake!
Finn| Woah!
Jermaine| Oh, you guys really came. Quick, get behind the salt barrier!
Jermaine| They can't cross the circle. It's made from Dad's old shaman-blessed, sage-infused salt.
Shadow Demon 2| Return my cup! Return my cup-- Stop poking me!
Jermaine| Knock it off, guys. Just get in the house.
Jermaine| You guys can chill here 'till morning, when the demons thin out a little.
Finn|  Whoo!
Jermaine| Oh, Finn--Oh no! Instant regret!
Finn| Whoo! My house, my house!
Jermaine|  Instant regret!
Finn| Whoo! Remember, Jermaine? We did this when we wanted to make room for dessert!
Jermaine| I don't care about that memory!
Finn| What?
Finn| Whoa--Ohh! Dang, my back.
Jermaine| Come on! This ain't the treehouse, man! I got systems!
Jake| Hey Jermaine, this thing is rad--Whoa!
Jermaine| Okay, no more sleepover!
Finn| Oh no! Don't--don't kick us out!
Jermaine| Go do your Gaucho Marx slapstick with them goofballs in the woods. I got a responsibility to all this booty in here--Staves, medallions, cups, goblets,  dormant jinn, grimoires, hard-drives... All this random valuable booty, okay?
Jermaine| Oh, shoot.
Jermaine| I gotta run this beast.
Jermaine| Open, ya sissy!
Jermaine| Yeah, flip the tape, I know.
Jermaine|" ""Good times."" Right."
Booboo Sousa| Hey! I'm Booboo Sousa! You want to be friends?
Jermaine| We've been friends, Booboo.
Bryce| You're slippin', Jerm.
Jermaine| No I'm not.
Bryce| You're gonna miss that alarm one day, and I'm gonna eat you from the bottom up,  so you can watch me while I eat you. Then, in my triumph, I will retrieve the poster your dad stole from me.
Jermaine| Bryce, I put the poster right there.  You're still mad about that?
Bryce| How dare you use tacks on my poster! You're gonna get it, man!
Jermaine|" You know, Bryce, I would've let you and your poster go years ago if you'd stop it with all that ""from the bottom up"" talk."
Bryce| You would?
Jermaine| Yeah, man! I don't want to flip that tape all day! That's you and Joshua beef 'cause you wouldn't stop breaking in for that poster.
Bryce| Well, come on man, let's be bros!
Jermaine| No way, you psycho. I ain't never gonna trust you after all that stuff you said. 
Bryce| I'm gonna taste that dog carne asada, you hear?!
Jermaine| You're never gonna taste my carne asada, Bryce.
Finn|  Dude, you can't live like this!
Jake|  Yeah, you got a plan B for Bryce, or what?
Jermaine| I don't need a plan B. I'm responsible. You guys want fried rice or something? I can make fried rice.
Jake| No, Jermaine, we'll make you fried rice.
Jermaine| Okay, just don't break any more junk. That's our parents' valuable artifacts, you knuckleheads.
Bryce| I'm gonna white-knuckle you, Jermaine! You'll see!
Jake| Whoo-hoo! I've never even made fried rice before!  Get the plates.
Finn|  Whoosh!
Jake|  Du-u-ump!  Pre-sen-tation. 
Jermaine| Good plating. Sorry I only have one chair.
Jake| To brothers! 
All| To brothers! 
Finn| It doesn't have to be weird, you guys!
Jermaine|  What's that sound? It sounds like howling.
Jake| Let's eat!
Jermaine| Dang, dude, this fried rice destroys. How'd you get all this flavor?
Jake| Sesame oil and salt. Salt is one of the five taste sensations.
Finn|  Sweet, sour, bitter, umami and salty.
Jermaine| I guess I'm just used to bitter.  That's weird. I haven't had salt in like five years. Hold on...
Jermaine| Epsilon, eucradies, dernesto, quillduct...  Uh, where'd you get the salt from, Jake?
Jake| I snooched a little from outside. Why?
Shadow Demon 2| Get my cup, Ariel! Please, dude!
Ariel| You get it! I need my DAT tapes.
Shadow Demon 2| I can't fit through that hole Ariel! Aaaah!
Finn and Jake| Got it!
Jermaine|  That sword's too unweildy, man.
Jake| But it'll look decent when I triple combo this bozo with this thing, right?
Finn| Like how?
Jake| Like this, bro! 
Jake| Aah! Oof!
Ariel| Boo, stupid!
Ariel| Where's my DAT tapes?!
Jermaine| Epsilon, eudradies, epilindus...
Jake| Oof! Why is this thing so dense?
Jermaine| I got your tapes over here!
Ariel| Give me my ta--Oof! Aah!
Jake| I got him! Hup!
Jake| Sha-boom! Woah, watch it!
Jake| Cut his arms, Finn!
Finn| Okay!
Finn| Woah!
Jake| Wha--?
Ariel| Aaaaah!
Shadow Demon 2| My cup, Jermaine!
Shadow Demon 2| Oof!
Shadow Demon 3| You're a pain, Jermaine!
Shadow Demons|  Jermaine the pain! Jermaine the pain!
Jake|  Awesome, dude! We won!
Jermaine| I didn't win!  When do I win?! Special guys one and two win every day! Crackin' jokes, readin' foodie mags in your tree-town fun-house. Must be nice to be so special you can go off and find your own fancy ways! Meanwhile I gotta stay here and watch Dad's trashy booty 'cause I never stretched into the sky and farted on the wings of a falcon, I guess!
Jake| Dude, I never farted on the wing of a falcon. 
Finn| Bros!
Jake| Chill, Jermaine.
Jermaine|  Think I don't want a cushy tree-house life?!  I don't even get salt! Saaalt!  Bark! Bark! Bark!  Huh?
Jake| Yeowch!
Jermaine| I'm sick of bein' Daddy's watchdog.
Finn|  This must've been building up for a while.
Jake| Woah!
Finn| Wah!
Finn| Hand fire.
Jermaine| You got to be Dad's favorite! I got stuck with his mess!
Jake| Come on. Dad didn't have a favorite. He just liked my fart jokes.
Jermaine| I'm the fart joke!
Creature| Shazbaz!  Uh, no. Shazbaz!
Jake| Ow. Dad loved us both.  You could've left any time.
Jermaine|  I know!
Jake| If you punch me again I'm gonna fart.
Jermaine| Oh man. I've really built my own cage.
Finn| Guys, guys, guys!
Finn| This whole place is burning down!
Finn| So if you're done being angry bonkers, let's work together!
Finn| Jermaine? You gonna leave me hanging, bro?
Jermaine| Let it burn.
Jake| Huh?!
Finn|  But all of Dad's stuff!
Jermaine| No... I think it's all right.
Finn| The salt line got broken.  Where'd all the d's go?
Jake|  Maybe with all their stuff gone they had no reason to stay.
Jermaine| Oh, no! The tape!
Jermaine| Open...!
Bryce| I got my poster!
Jermaine| Booboo Sousa...
Bryce| I ate his stupid face off! It was sick.
Jermaine| Ugh. Do you even know what you sound like when you talk like that?
Bryce| I sound cool.
Jermaine| If that's what you think.
Bryce| That's what I know.
Bryce| Dang. Has it always been so bright out here? Makes me wanna explode the sun and banish the Earth into darkness.
Jermaine| See? You're doing it again!
Marceline|  I warned you, dingle.
Finn|  I can hear the crown's promise of power. Invading my brain!  . Destiny Gang!  Yay! 
Marceline|  Careful there. Careful! Oh, dangit!  Oh, Simon   one more hit and that baby's gonna burst!
Finn|  Ice lightning!
Marceline|  Ah, dingle!
Finn|  What's happening?!!  Bar Bar! I'll save you 
Jake|  Finn? Finn?! Hey guy, where's my buddy?
Prismo|  Oh, when he wished for the Lich to have never existed  Finn left my time room and entered his wish altered reality. We can watch him on my TV wall. 
Finn|  Oooh...
Jake|  Whoa. Alternate-wish-world-Finn is mad uglies!  Hey, I'm mad uglies too!
Finn|  
Jake|  Everything looks nuts!
Prismo|"  Yes, sometimes a well intentioned wish can lead to... ""nuts."" But you know, you get a wish too."
Jake|   What?!
Prismo|  Yup, totally.  You can have anything you want.
Jake|  I wish for- a sandwich!
Prismo|  A sandwich, your gonna waste your one wish on a sandwich?! You don't want anything else?
Jake|  Nah, sandwich is good,  maybe about... this big.... or this big. On ciabatta bread maybe... mmm I don't know, whatever you have is your choice.
Prismo|  Dude, I'll just make you a sandwich! You should use your wish on something important.
Jake|  
Prismo|  You know... on someone who might need it.  I'm talking about him over there!
Jake|  Oooh...
Mom|  Oh! Finn? Huh?
Mom|  What, what on earth did this?
Finn|  I did this.
Mom|  No, that's not possible. I raised you better than that!
Finn|  It's true...
Mom|  
Finn|  I put out there fire... but I... also made the bomb go off. Urgh! The crown it compels me to- ice up everything!
Finn|   Urghah! I'm sorry mom, dad, little sibling.  . I'm too dangerous... to be around.
Mom|  What are you doing?
Finn|  Take them... far away Bar Bar.  Leave me! Leave me...
Prismo|  Looks like your friend is having a pretty rough time.
Jake|   Mmm, yeah, ah well, it's Finn's wish. Let's just see how it plays out. I got confidence in my boy!  Besides, I'll hang onto my wish in case i need it.  Awww!
Prismo|  Don't worry dude I gotcha covered!  They're homemade.
Jake|  I love you Prismo.
Prismo|  Oh yee!! 
Jake|"  I'm serious man, you're like a strong number three on my 'Cool Guys List.' Ah man, my dad use to make pickles , it's all he use to talk about, he'd obsess about them all the time, when I'd come in from playing he'd be like ""Here, Jake, try these!""  And they'd be pretty crunchy... actually you'd think they'd be soft but they weren't. I'd be like ""Wow dad! You'd made these pretty good!""  Yeah, that was dad."
Prismo|  
Finn|  Rise... my wintry warriors...
Trami|  Tromo!
Tromo|  Trami! Why am I cold and confused?!
Finn|  Fear not, icicle child! For I have brought you into a new life!
Tromo|  Eeh? The Mertens kid?
Finn|  The age of ice and whispering snow! 
Trami|  Hey, crack me loose T!
Tromo|  Come on!
Trami|  You see Big Destiny anywhere?
Big Destiny|  Big D's chillin' over here, wasteland style.
Finn|  Come back! Only I can protect ya'll.  Stay...
Trami|  Aaa! My kicks!
Finn|  Can't you hear the- the whispers?
Tromo|  Forget Big D! Let's go!
Big Destiny|  I've taught you well, my traitorous gang.
Finn|   The voices... they tell me to freeze the world.
Big Destiny|  Get off of me, you weirdo!
Finn|  I am the end and the beginning. I am the hand of madness.  Jake?
Prismo|"  Dude, I get out of relationships because I don't want to have a discussion about what we're gonna have for dinner every night! Cause when I'm alone I can just sit on the couch and I'm hungry I can eat whatever I want. It's not like  ""What should we eat for breakfast? Wait! We should coordinate!""  That's a pain."
Jake|   Mm-mm, man your view of relationships is very bleak, don't you get lonely?
Prismo|  I have friends.
Cosmic Owl|   Hello, hello. Hey, so I brought over the-  What is this singular doing in this realm?!
Prismo|  He's just here making a wish Cosmic Owl.
Cosmic Owl|  But I brought games! We were gonna hang!
Prismo|  ...after. Come on, get in here.
Cosmic Owl|  Okay. 
Finn|  Jake? Jake! 
Marceline|  I warned you... you butt...
Finn|  Raah!  
Jake|  
Finn|   Don't worry Jake, I'll share the secrets of ice and snow with thee. Heh heh, the power of frost! Power of frost! The power of fros-
Jake|  Three, two, one... go!
Jake|  We're three nice dudes, havin' fun! We got warm bubble water, on our buns! I love this spa, and that's a fact! But if I stay too long, I get a pruny back! 
Finn|  Jake... Jake, what are you doing?
Lich/Jake|  
Finn|  Back off my crown, Jake! I warn you!
Jake|  Hey man, I'm right here! That's not me man!
Lich/Jake|   Ah ha ha ha ha!
Finn|  
Jake|  Finn! I'm in the spa bath! Oh man!
Prismo|  Maybe now, you would like to use your wish?
Jake|   Make Finn okay! I wish for a safe Finn! 
Prismo|  Wait, dude! Look, I like you, so you should know my wishes always got an ironic twist to them. It's like a monkey's paw kind of thing.
Jake|   What?
Prismo|"  You just gotta be really specific. Say your wish is ""I wish for a back rub."" Who's gonna give it to you? A dirty man? A bear? And where does this ""masseuse"" come from? Do I zap some guy away from his family dinner? Leave some kid traumatized?"
Cosmic Owl|  Woo!
Prismo|   Mom, where did dad go?  Oh, I don't know son he just disappeared from the table... sorry.
Jake|  
Prismo|  You see, Jake there are rules to this stuff, wishing an event to be changes elements before and after it. Memories will be destroyed, babies will not be born. Potential worlds could be evaporated by your wish!
Jake|  
Prismo & Cosmic Owl|   Ewww! Uugh!
Jake|   I'm sorry, that's a lot of pressure man...
Prismo|  Focus, Jake!  Here, eat this egg, it's brain food.
Jake|   Oh, okay. Ooo, think... think!
Prismo|   Okay, there is a way to bring back all life and get home.
Jake|  
Prismo|  You just have to ch...
Jake|  Chaa...
Prismo & Jake|  Chaaange...
Prismo|  The Lii-
Jake|  The lipstick!
Prismo|  The Liiich's...
Jake|  The Lich's...
Prismo & Jake|  Ooowiii....sssh...ish
Jake|   Change the Lich's wish!
Prismo|  And go home.
Jake|  And go home! Okay, okay, I wish Lich's wish- was for me.
Prismo|  Aa-ah!
Jake|  And Finn, to go back home to Ooo!
Prismo|  I can work with that. Alright, this has been nice, see ya! 
Cosmic Owl|  Woo! 
Lich|  I wish- for the extinction of all  li-i-if for Finn and Jake to go back home to Ooo. Huh!? No wait, what's not what I wished for!
Prismo|  Sorry guy, you only get one wish. Hey Jake, did you see that? Monkey's paw.
Finn|  Jake! What the? Why would the Lich wish... what? Jake?!
Jake|   It worked!
Finn|  Jake! This is serious! Something really messed up is happening!
Jake|  Ha ha! It already happened! And it never happened!
Princess Bubblegum|  What? What happened?!
Jake|  Nothing, cause I saved everybody!
Ice King|  Oh Honey, I told you, you can take the sign off when you tell me where you hid daddy's crown jewels.
Gunter|  Wenk!
Ice King|  Gunter! Huh?  Woo wowsers!
Finn|  What's that?
Jake|   Hmm...
Prismo|   If you want to come back and hang out some time. Call me - P.
Jake|  I gotta get that guy a girlfriend.
Jake| Why don't we call, like child services? Or an exterminator?
Finn| This is gonna work. Just trust me, a'ight?
Jake| Ugh.
Finn| Do as I do.
Finn| Boy, I just love walking through our delightfully not-creepy doorway. Don't you, Jake?
Jake| Uh-huh, uh-huh. 
Finn| Walking through the not-creepy air to my not-creepy couch, sitting on my not-creepy butt.
BMO| Your butt is kinda creepy.
Finn| I say 'creepy' is just another label we use to distance ourselves from stuff we don't understand. Or that it reminds us of something in ourselves that we're not comfortable with. I mean, it just ain't an actual thing, you know? Unless you choose to believe it. Right, Jake?
Jake| It's baloney! It's baloney! It's Starchy's baloney! I just got to think of something wholesome.
Lady Rainicorn|   파이 먹자. 
Finn| Marceline, no!
Marceline| Don't let anyone read my diaries! Burn them, Finn! They're embarrassi—! 
Marceline's mom|" And then he said, ""Fine."" That's the story of how I met your dad."
Marceline| Can I play now?
Marceline's mom| No, Marceline, Sweetie. It's nap time.
Marceline| But I don't want to sleep! My dreams are weird.
Marceline's mom| All dreams are weird.
Marceline| But, Mom, my dreams are we-e-e-eird.
Marceline's mom|  Honey, something weird might just be something familiar viewed from a different angle. And that's not scary, right?
Simon|  Hello, Marci. I don't know if you'll ever hear this message. I fear my thoughts are no longer my own. Just watch over me...
Simon| ...until I can find my way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity. And then maybe, Betty, my princess—maybe you will love me again.  Please love me again, Betty!  Okay, bye!  
Marceline| Hey, Simon. I, uh, finished packing your gear. So can I have my tape now?
Simon| What? No. This is private, silly.  There you go. Snug as a bug.
Marceline| Seriously, Simon. Please don't go.
Simon| I... I have to protect you.
Marceline| How can you protect me if you're not even here?!
Simon| I'll arrange for someone to come take care of you. I'll make sure he doesn't leave.
Marceline| Please, Simon, I could help you with this.
Simon| Yeah, maybe one day you will. But until then, you have to stay brave, my fearless Marceline.
Marceline| Ouch!
Simon| You see? I have to go now. Goodbye, Marci. 
Marceline| What? No!  Wait! Ugh!  Simon! Simon!
Marceline| Yah! Ew!  Okay, I know you're here.
BMO|  Ha-ha! I win!
Finn|  Oh, hey, man.
Jake|  You and BMO play Finger Spread quietly. I need to get into the zone.  I am ready to receive instruction from the realm of creation above me and the sandwich I am about to conceive. I am open; use me.
Jake|   One, two, three, four, five, six.  Rosemary, thyme.  Sous-vide. Keep that at 135 degrees.  All right, now we're gettin' somewhere.  Cream cheese! Pickles from my boy Prismo! And some dill!  Diced boiled eggs! Bird from the window! Yeah, baby, now we're rollin'! Whoo!
Jake|  Common cucumber! Sliced Roma tomato. Sweet yellow onion—organic.  Oh, almost done.  Tears for salt. Meat prepared sous-vide. ♪Bacon.♪  You're the most important part.  Lobster soul.  It's amazing! Ohhh,  this is the greatest sandwich I've ever made!
Finn| Is it glowing?
Jake| You guys want some?
Finn| It's cool, man. I know you want to eat the whole thing, and I'm cool with that.
Jake| Thank you.  Magic Man!
Magic Man| Magic dog! I'll take some sandwich!
Jake| You stay away from my woman! Eh, my sandwich!
Magic Man|  Hmm... yeah, I could do that... or... wait, wait! 
Jake| Sandwiche! Mijo! Magic Man! My sandwich!
Magic Man| That's a good-looking sandwich.
Jake| What are you gonna do with it? Something gross?
Magic Man|  It's got my germs, so it's mine now.
Jake| NOOOO! 
Magic Man| Dead arms! 
Jake|  Give it back, you animal!
Magic Man| Look, if you really want your sandwich, you'll have to solve my little riddle.  When your face shows 720, when green leaves turn brown, the only way forward is down. Then you'll see, the wetter, the better.
Jake| That's not even a riddle! It's wordplay, at best!
Magic Man| You try and come up with something on the spot! It's hard! 
Jake| Ow!
Magic Man| Now to savor the moment.   It's just you and me, baby. 
Jake| What the?
Finn| Jake, wait!
Jake|  What's he doin' in there? Why did he freeze himself with my sandwich?
Finn| He's not frozen. He's super slow-mozin', motion. Look.
Jake| Aww, that's gross!
Finn| Well, let's go grab it before he hits the ground, which is when I assume he'll take a bite.
Jake| Yeah, okay.
Finn| Hmm.  Feels like cold spaghetti. 
Finn|  Oh... hey, Jake.
Jake|  Hey, Finn.
Jake|  How long have we been in here?
Finn|  I don't know.
Jake|  Retreat!
Finn| Whoa, how long were we in there?
BMO| Five hours.
Jake| Five hours?!  He's halfway to hittin' the ground... which is when he'll bite my sandwich, probably.
BMO| Yes.
Finn|  BMO!
BMO| I agree that is when he will probably take a bite.
Finn| You're not helping.
BMO| Oh, you need help? I can help.  Processing.
Jake| Must be his new software.
BMO| Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Ding! I have the solution, Jake.
Jake| What?! BMO, are you serious?
BMO| Yes, this plan will work.
Jake| Yes!
BMO| But we have to hurry.
Jake| Yes!
Finn| Alright, BMO!
Finn| Wait, wait, wait. BMO, are you just making a skateboard video?
BMO| No, Finn. This is the plan.
Jake| Are you sure?
BMO| Jake, you will have your sandwich back before my board hits the ground.
Jake| Okay, BMO.
BMO| Yay, BMO!  This is iiiii... 
Jake| He lied to me.
Finn| Relax.  I'm calling Princess Bubblegum. It's ringing.
Jake|  Maybe I should just make another one.   Eh, okay. Let's do this. I can make another awesome sandwich. Creation realm, inspire me once again!   Okay.
Finn| Thanks again for coming, Prubbles.
Princess Bubblegum| Of course, Finn. Once you explained about Jake's sandwich, I had to. 
Finn| So, how's it looking?
Princess Bubblegum| I'm picking up major levels here.
Finn| Of magic?
Princess Bubblegum| Molasses.
Finn| Oh.
Princess Bubblegum| He's using a molasses-based super-covalent subatomic bond, slowing down anything that enters its field, but only if the molasses is at room temperature. Hmm, this one.  My molasses warmer will get things moving.
BMO|  ...iiiiiiiii...
Princess Bubblegum| Well, I'm out of ideas. 
Finn| Who ya calling?
Princess Bubblegum| Marceline.
Finn| The vampire queen?!
Jake| Oh... maybe... maybe it's just as good!  Blech!  It's terrible!  Dang you, Magic Man! You took my one and only! 
Princess Bubblegum| See, I think the molasses must be protected by some sort of chemical—
Marceline| Oh, hey, Jake. How you holding up?
Jake| Not too well. BMO looks cool, though.
BMO|  ...iiiiiiii...
Marceline| Don't be sad.
Princess Bubblegum| Yeah, Marceline's got a great plan.
Finn| Yeah, man!
Jake| What's your plan?
Marceline|  Demon juice!   
BMO| ...iiiiiiiii...
Finn| Hey, man. What are you doing?
Jake| I'm lighting these candles so I can move on with the grieving process. I made them with the leftover bacon fat from my sand—
Finn| I am not giving up.  Let's see. Who should I call? Ice King? Shelby? Tree Trunks?
Jake| Tree Trunks?! No, man, don't call Tree Trunks! What's she gonna do, bake an apple pie?! Don't you get it?! It's over. It's over, and I've never been so sad. And you know what? I got to deal with it. 
Finn| Jake, look!
Jake| Hmm? What? But how?
Finn| Because you've never been this sad! That's what Magic Man meant by your face showing 720, or as some people call it, a sad face.
Jake| What?! Nobody  calls it that.
Finn| Nope! No! Don't get judgmental.
Princess Bubblegum| Stay sad.
Jake| Right.   Magic Man, I'm gonna sock you in the head!   
Finn| Jake, every time you get happy, you slow down! Stay sad, man! Make yourself sad!
Jake| Uh... okay!
Lady Rainicorn| 제이이이이크! 
Mr. Cupcake|  It's okay, Lady. You gotta let go. He's gone now. Let me take you out for a coffee... get your mind off things.
Lady Rainicorn| 컵케이크 씨, 정말 고마워요. 당신은, 정말 좋은 친구예요. ( Mr. Cupcake, Thank you . You're really a good friend.
Mr. Cupcake| Hey, Lady, I'm here for you. Don't you ever forget that.
Jake| Hey, Mr. Cupcake, you stay away  from Lady!
Finn| No, man! Stay sad! Make yourself sad!
Jake| Uh...
Mr. Cupcake| I, I love you, Jake. We should have hung out more.
Jake| What? Um, I love you too, Mr. Cupcake. I didn't want to hang because I thought Lady was into your muscles. And I thought if we'd hung out, you'd sweet-talk her and take her from me.
Mr. Cupcake| What? I would never. I've got so much respect for you.
Jake| Dude, I have so much respect for you! I try to be like you in some aspects of my life! Look, if something were to happen to me, and I wasn't here anymore, I'd want you to take care of Lady and the kids.
Mr. Cupcake| That means so much to me.  I wish we had more time together.
Jake|  Me, too!  
Finn| Yeah, Jake! The wetter, the better! Keep crying!
Jake| I'm sorry, Mr. Cupcake! 
BMO| Boardslide!
Jake|  Ah-haaaaa! 
Princess Bubblegum| Yay!
Jake| I got you, baby.   This sandwich is so good!
Earl of Lemongrab| Hello! And keep away from Castle Lemongrab!
Lemongrab| How are you today? Mm, I see. Yes. I'm inside my fortified totalitarian city-state. Hello, I'm Lemongrab.
Lemongrab 2|  Me too!
Lemongrab 2| Ow!
Lemongrab| Mm. Unacceptable.
Lemongrab| Things have never been better here at Castle Lemongrab.
Lemongrab| I have never been fatter.
Lemongrab| And since the expulsion of Lemonhope...
Lemongrab| We have reached peak societal obediency.
Lemongrab| Law, order...
Lemongrab| Harp-smashing.
Lemongrab| We've have it all!
Lemongrab| Mm, the pleasure. Smash another! Ooh, who is this?
Lemongrab|  I'm one of my subjects! I'm being punished for helping Lemonhope. But that's okay! 
Lemongrab| Yes, morale has never been higher since we got rid of hope. In conclusion, no one needs to come here ever, especially Lemonhope, and I ate my brother. Goodbye!
Lemongrab 2| Save us, Lemonhope! You're our only lemon-ho—!
Princess Bubblegum| Lights on.  Oh, Lemonhope, were you even paying attention?
Lemonhope| Mmmmmm, yes. 
Princess Bubblegum| I know this is a lot to take in, but one day, saving those lemons is going to be your responsibility. They're in trouble, and you need to work harder at this.
Lemonhope| Eh...  I don't know. I'm not too worried about other people, I guess. Like, I got me, and they got them. Mm.
Princess Bubblegum| O-kay... Let's try something else.  These are cupcakes.
Finn| Cup-cups!
Princess Bubblegum| Lemonhope,  you have two cupcakes. Finn has no cupcakes. Lemonhope, will you give Finn one of your cupcakes?
Lemonhope| Um...
Finn|  Yes.
Lemonhope| Oh... but I don't want to! I want both cupcakes. Finn can get his own cupcakes! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Maybe we need something more hands-on. Hey, Finn, listen, that's it for class today.
Finn| Whoop!  Whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop...
Princess Bubblegum|  But read the next three chapters of your geometry text! Well, at least he's street-smart.  Okay, dude, we're going on a field-trip.
Princess Bubblegum| This is the Lemon Earldom perimeter. Unfortunately, there are pacts and treaties preventing me from getting any closer. We should cloak.  I know you don't like thinking about Castle Lemongrab, but it's where your family is. They set you free, and now they're being punished for it. It rips. Look!
Lemon Person| Remember, Lemonhope!
Lemongrab| I'm going to eat you!
Lemongrab| I did it!
Princess Bubblegum| D'ya see? They helped you. You have to help them now. It's your responsibility.
Lemonhope| No! I don't have to do anything that I don't want to. They set me free, and free means I decide what I do, not them and not you!
Princess Bubblegum| Dude, I'm sorry, but that attitude is unacceptable—oh! I mean...  Lemonhope?
Lemonhope|" ♪Lemonhope's got feet that take him to fun.  Lemonhope's got meat that's warm in the sun.  Lemonhope's got no future plans, fully undeterred. No shirts,  no pants,  no ""won't""s,  no ""can't""s."
Lemonhope| ♪My body's free like a li'l baby bird. Caw! Lemonhope's got legs that'll strut hot struts. Lemonhope's got thighs that'll pump both butts. He's... got a harp, s'got a flute, free to strum,  free to toot! Free from PB-gum, I'm a lemon of  freedom!♪  Oh. It's warm.
Pirate| Pick it up, you chumps! We've got to make Deaveston by brunch.
Lemonhope| Oh, man, that thing looks just lousy with freedom... straight-up right out the diddle-doo, comin' at ya right straight up. Ha-ha!
Lemonhope| Yeah, exactly.  A-ha-ha-ha!  Wha-a-at? Okay...  It takes all kinds, I guess! 
Pirate| Argh! A Greed Lard!
Lemonhope|  Oh, my fontanelle. Hello? I—I accidentally came on to your boat,  but—but I think I really need some help.
Lemongrab 2| Hey. Hey, guy. Back here.
Lemongrab 2| Hey, c'mon, I've fallen off back there. Guy? Hey, buddy.
Princess Bubblegum| Psst. Down here.
Princess Bubblegum| Psst. Lemonhope, it's me. You are... You are unacceptable!
Lemongrab 2| Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy...
Lemonhope|  A lot of nightmares again. I guess that's freedom for you. Oh.
Lemonhope|  Mm.  Thirsty.  Nothing like juice for breakfast.  Oh. I guess that's the rest of those.  Well, I guess if there's no juice, I got freedom to go find water. 
Lemonhope| Huh. Weird cloud's still there.  Couldn't rain a little, could ya? Huh, cloud? Eh, what are you gonna do? Freedom not to rain, I guess. 
Lemonhope|  Lemonhope's got meat that's warm in the sun. My lemon of...  freedom!
Ice King|  Okay, Gunter! You ready for the show to begin?!
Gunter|  Wenk! 
Ice King|  One, two, three...   Gunter!    It's rhetorical, Gunter. Marceline's songs are so good! Mmm... Maybe I can get Marceline to write a song with me!  Man, if she helped me write a song like that, I'd be crushin' it nonstop with the princesses! Ooh, yeah!  Heh! Gunter, you cute little dummy. You know, Gunter, my song is gonna need some dope lyrics to lure the honeys in. Hmm.
Ice King|"  Jay T. Doggzone always says, ""Ladies are drawn to bros with tortured pasts."" And I've got a way tortured past! ...I think. I don't really... re...  Hmm.  Quickly, Gunter! To the ""The Past"" room!"
Ice King|  Lot of emotional, powerful stuff in here.  Still wet with tears... I'll take some-a' these for lyrical inspiration.  So where's Marceline living these days?
Penguin|  Wenk.
Ice King|  A cave?? 
Finn|   Well, well, well. Looks like the Ice King is up to bad biscuits, brotha.
Jake|  Bad biscuits make the baker broke, bro.
Finn|  Ice King, you make our job too easy. You ready to roll on this fool?
Jake|  Dinner roll!
Ice King|  Hello? Anybody home?
Marceline|   No...  What are you doing here? I told you not to come around me!
Ice King|   Uh, yeah, I know, but... I was hoping you could help me write a song—one that could help me get some princess action.
Marceline|  I'm not gonna help you pick up on chicks!
Ice King|   Come on! We could be a prog rock duo! I'll even split the fans with you. I get the princesses, and you get... whatever it is you're into. Sounds good, yeah, I think it does!  Ee-yoop!
Marceline|   Hey!!
Ice King|  Eh...
Marceline|  Get outta here!!
Ice King|  Wait! Just let me play you what I've written so far!   Oh. Dang it. Tangles in the cord. Sometimes this happens when you fly with it... Tangles are hard...  Oh. Aw, aw, geez, no... Oh, no.  Ice King's in trouble.    Hey, you know what? I'll just hum it for ya.  Is that good?
Finn & Jake|  Ice King!
Finn|  ...Wha?
Jake|  Oh... You got 'im.
Finn|  Nice job, Marceline.
Jake|   Your constant harassment of the female gender makes me sick.
Marceline|  No, he can stay.
Finn & Jake|  Wha?!
Ice King|"  Yeah, ""Wha?!"""
Marceline|  It's alright. We're working on a song together. 
Finn|  You don't want us to...  ...for you?
Marceline|  No, it's okay. You guys can go.
Finn|  ...Okay... Well... I guess we'll see ya, then...
Finn & Jake|  Bye... 
Ice King|   You know, I kinda like bein' tied up in these cords. Kinda freak-aaaayyy!
Marceline|  So what kinda song're we playing?
Ice King|  Ooh. I brought these  for some inspiration. Just use these to work off of. Y'know, a template.
Marceline|  Oookaaaay...
Ice King|  Yeah. Yeah, that's good! Keep doin' that!   Slime Princess, you're alright. Flame Princess, you're okay. Wildberry Princess could be better. All of the princesses are pretty alright, but... Oh, Bubblegum! You look like a lot of fun! I'm right outside, and that is how I know! Hey, princess, did you get my text with a picture of my awesome gun show? I'm also workin' on my pecs! If you like, I'll send a picture of that, too! Oh, Bubblegum!  I really need someone.  Or anyone!  ...Pretty much anyone. I'm so alone!  Won't somebody tell me what's wrong with me?!  Anybody!  Anybody!   Anybody!!!  Grod in the sky, please tell me why!!!
Marceline|  Stop acting like this!!
Ice King|  No, it's just startin' to get good!!  Anybody!!  Princesses, I command you, love me!! Love me!! Love me!!  Love me!!
Marceline|   STOP ACTING CRAZY.
Ice King|  I JUST WANNA BE LOVED!!  Uh-oh. I'm sorry I pushed you.  Uh... oh... I'll just stay out of your way.  Again, I'm sorry I pushed you.
Marceline|  Huh?
Ice King|  Whatcha got? An apple?
Marceline|   Ugh!   You're so annoying, you pitiful old man. I'd like to help you, but I don't know if I can. I thought you were nuts, but you're really really really nuts.  Every time I move, eventually, you find me, and start hanging around. Just another lame excuse to see me. Man. It's getting me down. You know, I'm actually glad... to see you!  Maybe I'm the one who's...  nuts.
Ice King|  Hold on!  Do you... like me?!
Marceline|  ...Of course I do, you old jerk!
Ice King|  Really? ...Wow.  How about...  one of these?  Ah!  Mwah, mwah, mwah...
Marceline|   AAAAAGH!!! Not like that!! You don't remember anything, do you... SIMON?
Ice King|  What-mon?
Marceline|  Why do you even come see me when you don't remember me?! You don't even know who you are!
Ice King|  Yes, I do! I am a lyricist!  It's all here! On the page! The page in song, baby! On this receipt! On this takeout menu! On these newspapers! 
Marceline|  Huh? Look! This clipping! This was you, Simon! Before the War!
Ice King|  Huh?  Heh?
Marceline|  This! You took this picture! Grr, you've scribbled all over it... Huh? 
Ice King|  Ooh, ooh, are they good lyrics?  I'll get the keyboard!
Marceline|  What?  Wait, listen!
Ice King|   Yeah, let's go! What's it say? Sing out, sister!
Marceline|"   ""Marceline, is it just you and me in the wreckage of the world? That must be so confusing for a little girl. And I know you're going to need me here with you... but I'm losing myself, and I'm afraid you're going to lose me, too..."""
Ice King|  Ooh, yeah! Keep it going! 
Marceline|"   Oh! Um...  ""This magic keeps me alive, but it's making me  crazy, and I need to save you, but who's going to save me? Please forgive me for whatever I do  ...when I don't remember you."""
Ice King|   Wow! I wrote that?! Hot stuff!
Marceline|  What?! You don't remember what it means?!  Look!
Ice King|"   ""Marceline, I can feel myself slipping away. I can't remember what it made me say... but I remember that I saw you frown. I swear, it wasn't me. It was the crown.  This magic keeps me—"""
Ice King & Marceline|"   ""—alive, but it's making me crazy,  and I want to save you, but who's going to save me?! Please forgive me for..."""
Jake|  What is goin' on in there?!
Finn|   ...I have no idea.
Ice King & Marceline|"   ""...Please forgive me for whatever I do... when I don't remember you."""
Chips| Chips?
Ice Cream| Ice cream?
Chips| Chips!  Chips. Ch-i-ips!
Ice cream|  Ice cream!
Finn| I don't get it.
Jake| Ah, just keep watching. BMO said the second act gets crazy.
Chips| Chips chips chips. Chips chips... Chips!
Ice Cream| Ice cream! 
Chips|  Chips...
Ice Cream|  Ice cream...
BMO|  Bravo!
Jake| What the stuff was that?!
Mother Rabbit| Come on, kids! We're going to grandma's.
BMO| Dinner? Please can we invite him to dinner?
Jake| No.
BMO| But, Jake, I never ask you for anything. When did I ever ask you for anything?
BMO|" Yesterday. You said, ] ""Jake, please take me to see Chips and Ice Cream! It's a Broadway smash!"" And I believed you."
BMO|  You don't understand me, Jake.
BMO|  Please come over for dinner! I love you! 
Morty Rogers| Yeah. Dinner sounds great!  Yeah! Wait. The place where you eat dinner, does the moon shine through the window at night?
Finn| Sure.
Morty Rogers| All right! Let's do it!
BMO| Oh, ooh! And when Chips trips over the turtle, it was so funny! But also sad. It made me think about the fragility of my own life.
Morty Rogers|  Just a little more...
Jake|  Hey, y'all ready for some sushi burgers?
Morty Rogers| Mm, I don't eat burgers. Got any chips and ice cream?
Jake| Uh..Sure. I just sculpted these buns though.
BMO|  Give the man what he wants! Soo, is your name Chips and Ice cream?
Morty Rogers| My name is Morty Rogers.
BMO|  I see.
Jake|  Okay! Food's done. 
Morty Rogers| Let's all dig in!  Yes, eat it. Eat that chips and ice cream.
BMO| Oh, yes sir! 
Morty Rogers|  It's time. 
Chips| Chips chips chips?
Ice Cream| Ice cream ice cream.
BMO| No...Flipping...Way!
Morty Rogers|  By the light of the waxing moon, which was just unveiled by the parting clouds, I command these two imps that have taken possession of my ears to transfer onto the head of the being who is directly across from me and is currently eating chips and ice cream!
Chips| Chips chips?!
Ice Cream| Ice cream...
Morty Rogers| Huh  It worked! I'm a free bear! 
Jake| Well, now I'm a guy with these things on my head. I guess I'm just gonna roll with the punches.
Finn| Uh... Don't worry, man. I'm gonna pretend they're not even there.
Chips| Chips!
Ice Cream| Ice cream!
BMO| This is the greatest day of my liiife!
Jake| Maybe if I put a towel over my head they'll go to sleep. 
Finn| Huh. What's on your head? I don't even notice it.
Jake| Heh. Yeah, okay. 
Chips|  Chips chips.
Ice Cream|  Ice cream.
BMO|  Huh?
Chips| Chips... Chips...!
Chips| Chips! Chips chips chips. Chips! Chips chips?!
Ice Cream|  Ice cream?
Chips| Chips chips! Chips chips chips chips chips!
Ice Cream|  Ice cream? Ice cream ice cream ice cream!
Jake|  All right, that's enough. They're going outside. 
BMO| Nooooooo!
Chips| Chips.
Ice Cream|  Ice cream.
BMO|  Poor Chips and Ice Cream. 
Ice Cream|  Ah, ah, ah, ah ice cream.
Chips|  Chips chips chips chips...
Finn|  Why are you up so early?
Jake|  I got to get to the farmer's market before all the choice stuff is gone.
Finn| Oh. Why is BMO on your head?
Jake| He is?!
Chips| Chips chips.
Ice Cream| Ice cream.
BMO| I'm onto something important!
Jake| Quit clownin' around.
BMO| Okay. I was done anyhow.   Chips chips.
Jake| So, you want me to pick up any snacks?
Finn| Yeah, maybe some ketchup chips?
Chips|  Chips.
Finn| And...some kale  chips.
Chips|  Chips!
Finn| And some corn...  chips.
Chips|  Chips.
Jake| Okay.  Later, dude.
Finn| Later.
Chips|  Chips!
Ice Cream|  Ice cream!
Jake|  Hmm..
Apple Merchant| Nice choice! Those are two of my faves!
Chips|  Chips.
Apple Merchant| Yeah, we have chips.
Ice Cream|  Ice cream?
Apple Merchant| Sorry. I don't have any ice cream, but I know who does.  Hey, John!
John| Yo!
Apple Merchant| I gots a customer for yas. I'll bag these for ya.
John|  Enjoy and stay awesome.  Yo! I got ice creams!
Ice Cream|  Ice cream?
John| I recommend the hamburger flavor. Also, the pizza flavor is tremendous!
Customer| Do you have taco?
John| One second!  One taco flavored.
Customer|  You have the best!
John| You have the best, out-of-this-world day.  What's your spectacular choice?
Morty Rogers|  No. No! Stay away! You can't make me take them back!
Jake|  Oh hey, Morty Rogers.
Ice Cream| Ice cream!
John| Tremendous.
Morty Rogers|  No more chips. No more ice cream.  Beans. That's what regular-sized-ear folks eat. Regular old morty Rogers...  
Morty Rogers| Oh! I hope the record is not scratched or chipped. Chip. Ice cream. [Grabs buttons and sewing thread from a drawer.
Morty Rogers|  Chips. 
Chips| Chips chips chips.
Ice Cream| Ice creaaaam.
Morty Rogers|  Chips chips! Chip chip. Ice cream! Ice cream!
Morty Rogers| Hush! Hush! Hush!  Noiseless, Chips!  Inaudible, Ice Cream!  Nyahah!
Finn|  Aah! Quiet!  I thought I could just ignore them, but I can't! Chips and Ice Cream have to go!
Jake|  Listen. Even if I could find Morty Rogers again, I don't know how to get these things to go back to him or even if they want to.
Chips| Chips chips!
Ice Cream| Ice cream!
BMO|  I finished with my computations! As I thought, it's a real language they are speaking based on intonations!  Chips? Chips chips chips! Ice cream?
BMO|  I know what we have to do.
Morty Rogers|  How many years did I search for a rube to take my burden?  What's wrong with me? You two brought me nothing but pain...  And I can't stop thinking of you. But I don't want you back!  I don't want you!
Morty Rogers|  What's that?  Do you hear that? 
Morty Rogers|  It's like--Chips..Ice Cream.  I..must..I..must!
BMO|  He's here!
Jake|  I love you, Chips and Ice Cream. I hope you never leave.
Morty Rogers| No! Those are my Chips and Ice Cream! By the light of the waxing moon, which was just unveiled by the parting clouds, transfer those two imps that have taken possession of Jake's ears to the head of the being who is watching from the window! Chips and Ice Cream!
Finn| BMO, it's happening!
Morty Rogers| No! My Chips! And Ice Cream!
BMO|  Free!
Morty Rogers| Noooo!
Finn| Whoa.
Morty Rogers| What's going on?
BMO| Chips and Ice Cream wanted to be free. But they could only be if I interrupted the transference ritual.
Morty Rogers| Free? I'm sorry for keeping you dudes as my prisoners for so many years.  But what am I gonna do without you?!
Chips| Chips.
Ice Cream| Ice cream.
Morty Rogers| What?
Chips| Chips!
Ice Cream| Ice cream!
Chips| Chips.
Ice Cream| Ice cream.
Ice King| Oh, boy  Oh, you're so pretty when you sleep, let's go back to Ice King's house,  Hi, baby....
Princess Bubblegum|  Ice King, what are you doing in my bedroom?!
Ice King|  Baby, I was trying to surprise you by moving you to my place while you sleep, then have you wake up to breakfast in bed, but now you've ruined the surprise, way to go.
Princess Bubblegum|  Do you think I like being kidnapped is that what you think I want!
Ice King|  Okay, here we go, you're the victim right? You know what, since day one I've been doing everything to make this relationship work and for what?!
Princess Bubblegum|  Banana Guards! 
Ice King|  Babe, come on, we promised we wouldn't make our problems public 
Princess Bubblegum|   Take him out. 
Ice King|  No, baby! What are you doing?!  Baby bear!  This is just so crazy, if you can honestly look into your heart and tell me you want me to leave, I'll go!
Princess Bubblegum|   Okay, leave.
Ice King|   Uh-what? D-did you look in your heart, like all around it?
Princess Bubblegum|   Yes.
Ice King|  I see. Then obviously you have got some heavy emotions stirring in you and you have said some very rash things.  Guards! Take me away! 
Finn|  Ice King, get out of Princess-
Ice King|  I'm leaving! 
Ice King|  Uh, I don't know, did I say the right thing? I can never tell with that girl.   All I can think about... is you, baby girl. I gotta leave Ooo, start somewhere fresh.  Goodbye, Gunter, you're the... man of the house now. 
Ice King|  Oh, clam balls! 
Ice King|  Where am I?  Hmm, no signs of life. Just me and these palm fronds,  And that bird over there.  Well, won't be needing this anymore,   I miss her, man.  Hello?  Is someone here?  Must be from somewhere.  There, now I can look around and- sweet mother of Glob! This island doesn't have a lady - this island is a lady!
Isla de Señorita|  Oh, hello there!
Ice King|  Hello.
Isla de Señorita|  Is my singing bothering you?
Ice King|  No.
Isla de Señorita|  ...What?!
Ice King|  No!
Isla de Señorita|  What?
Ice King|  No!!
Isla de Señorita| ...What?
Ice King|  Ugh, hold on a sec! 
Ice King|   Fuu, what was the question?
Isla de Señorita|  I asked if my singing was bothering you.
Ice King|   No, um, not at all, in fact it was quite enchanting.
Isla de Señorita|  I always sing when by boyfriend is away.
Ice King|  Boyfriend?
Isla de Señorita|  Yeah, Party God, do you know him?
Ice King|  Oh eh, sure, I mean, I know of him.
Isla de Señorita|  Oh no, that's him, quick hide! He gets crazy jealous!
Ice King|  Crazy jealous?! 
Party God|  
Isla de Señorita|  Hi.
Party God|"  Hey, babe, is that a zit on your face? Gross.  You've seen my boombox? I totally puked in Jimmy's stereo and killed the party I was at, he was like, ""Hey, Party God, you can't spin faster than me!"" And I was like, ""I totally can, Jimmy."" So we started spinnin', then I got super dizzy and was like Blaugh blaugh, right into the speaker!  Hurr hurr, found it. Okay, I'm bouncing out, babe."
Isla de Señorita|  Oh, you wanna hang before you go?
Party God|  Oh... yeah... uh well, um, I'm sort of in the middle of party, so...
Isla de Señorita|  Oh, well it would just be for a minute.
Party God|  But, eh, I puked in Jimmy's stereo, I can't party-foul the party. I'm the Party God.
Isla de Señorita|  Okay
Party God|  Don't be mad, babe.
Isla de Señorita|  I won't- I'm not.
Party God|  Okay, laters- ouuu!
Isla de Señorita|  
Ice King|   Ugh, what a wad bag.
Isla de Señorita|  Oh, he's okay... sometimes.
Ice King|   Gurl, he's no good for you.
Isla de Señorita|   I know.
Ice King|  Ah, who am I kidding. My GF, Princess Bubblegum, treats me like poopies too. The expression on your face when he bounced out on ya, well, I might as well have been lookin' in mirror.
Isla de Señorita|  Neglected lovers party of two! 
Ice King|   Yeah, that's us.
Isla de Señorita|  Well, I like you. You're welcome to stay here as long as you want.
Ice King|  Are you sure?
Isla de Señorita|  Yes, I appreciate your company. 
Ice King|   Yeah, well, PB is just so closed off to her emotions, she crushes the relationship so she doesn't ever have to develop feelings.
Isla de Señorita|  I don't even matter to Party God, he just parties all the time. He doesn't even notice if I'm there or not.
Ice King|  Oh, that's terrible, at least Bubblegum cares if I'm there.
Isla de Señorita|  Sometimes, I wish he would just go into outer space so I'd never have to see him again.
Ice King|  Yeah, he's awful, you shouldn't have to put up with that.
Isla de Señorita|  Yeah, that's true.
Ice King|  Yeah, girl.
Isla de Señorita|  ...I'm gonna break up with him!
Ice King|   Yeah, girl!
Party God|  
Ice King|  Oh, snaps! Good luck! 
Party God|  Ouuuu... I forgot the batteries.
Isla de Señorita|  Hey, babe, I have to tell you something.  Uh, babe?
Party God|  Found them.  Huh, hey what's that?
Isla de Señorita|  Oh, that just washed up on me after a storm.
Party God|  Hmmm, oh whatever, what did you want to tell me.
Isla de Señorita|  Well, I've been doing some thinking. And I- I...
Party God|  Aye, yai yai, what?
Isla de Señorita|  I I... hope you have fun at your party...
Party God|  Ugh! You're killing me babe, ouuuuu 
Ice King|   Uh! What was that?!
Isla de Señorita|  Uh...
Ice King|"  You should have been like ""I am done with you! Bam! Pack your bags and get out my face!"""
Isla de Señorita|  I-
Ice King|  Whatever, I'm gonna break up with him for ya'! 
Party God|  
Ice King|  Hey, yo! Yo, dog! I need to talk to you.
Party God|  Who are you?!
Ice King|  I'm Ice King, we sort of met that time at Peppermint Butler's. Anyway, I've been spending lots of time with your girlfriend, and she re-.
Party God|  Whaaaat?!! Hey wait, you're the guy who's been living on her stomach.
Ice King|  Yeah, but no! It was strictly platonic! I wasn't hitting on her or anything.
Party God|  There's going to be two hits, bro, me hitting you and a second instance of me hitting you. 
Ice King|  Whoa mama!  L-let's talk this out! Think about what's best for her- Ice Lightening!! 
Party God|  
Ice King|  Wowzers! 
Party God|  Aa yeah, run blue piggy! 
Ice King|  Take it easy, wolfy, I just stomped grapes on her tummy, alright! Ahh! Bread balls bread balls bread balls!  Psych!  Eat it, party puppy! 
Party God|   Face it bro, my divinity is unassailable. You should have stayed out of my business.
Ice King|"   She is not your ""bid-ness""! "
Party God|"  I can dodge your ""zyaps"" for days "
Ice King|  Uh oh.  Hmmm.
Isla de Señorita|  Party God? 
Ice King|  Hey, girl 
Isla de Señorita|  Did Ice King tell you to come talk to me?
Ice King|  Um, maybe.
Isla de Señorita|  Oh...
Ice King|  So, is there something you wanted to tell me?
Isla de Señorita|  Uh, nope- I'm good!
Ice King|  Eh, ah ah, um didn't you get some good advice from a cool bro and you want to tell me something important that would be difficult but good for your future life in the long run?
Isla de Señorita|  W-well, y-yes. You're bad and I'm terminating our romance! Bam, get out of my face! Wow, I never would have been able to do that without the advice from my emotionally mature friend, Ice King.
Ice King|  Huh? Um, Ice King wanted me to tell you that he's going to break up with his girlfriend too, and- that- your as much of an inspiration to him as he was to you. If not less so.
Isla de Señorita|  Mmm, that's nice.
Ice King|  He says he'll be sure to visit. Oh, I'm going into outer space now!
Isla de Señorita|  Oh, okay.
Ice King|  
Isla de Señorita|  Whew.
Ice King|  
Princess Bubblegum|  Fun cakes! 
Ice King|  I've come to a decision, you ready to hear it? I'm breaking up with ya! You party too much, you never want to spend time with me and you only care about having fun and other people's stereos! I'm just a big island you can come and go from as you please!
Princess Bubblegum|  BANANA GUARDS!!
Ice King|  Banana Guard yourself, Princess!!  Ah, we'll work it out.
Kee-Oth|  Your butt is mine, Joshua.
Jake| What? My butt? Weird. Where are we?
Kee-Oth| This is my yoga room. And this is your new home.  Downward, dog!
Jake| Ouch!
Kee-Oth| Welcome to revenge, Joshua. You'll never see your loved ones again. Everything you need for survival is booby-trapped!
Jake| Hmm.
Kee-Oth| Now I'm gonna gank your blood the way you ganked mine.
Kee-Oth| Boo-yeah! How does it feel, dog? How does it feel that I've juiced your body and turned your blood into man dazzle?
Jake| Hmm. Not that great. I feel weird in my skin.
Kee-Oth|  Wait. Is that it?
Jake| Yeah... but I could get used to this.
Kee-Oth| What? No! You have to suffer.
Jake| Okay.
Kee-Oth|" No ""okay."" When I say something, you're supposed to disagree! Okay?"
Jake| Okay.
Kee-Oth|  Sheesh. You're causing tension in my neck and shoulders. I'm gonna go stretch it out. You stay here and suffer.
Jake| Okay.
Finn| Jake?  Drat! Hmmmmmmm.  Ah! 
Lady|  여보세요? 
Finn| Hey, Lady. Listen. Your husband got abducted by Kee-Oth the demon.
Lady|  누구? Jake? 
Finn| Yeah, your hubby - your boyfriend or whatever.
Lady|  어머, 뭔 소리야! 걔 내 남자친구잖아! 왜 자꾸 우리 사이를 이상한 쪽으로 몰고 가려고 그래? 
Finn| Yo, my Korean is not that good. Can you just get over here? We need to find a way to Kee-Oth's dimension 십시요..
Lady|   아! 맞아. 내가 도움 될 만한 거 가지고 있어! 
Finn| Alright. That sounds...affirmative. See you soon. Bye. 
Jake|  Broke-up dimension, you're breakin' my heart. I'm lookin' for broke-up girl to break me apart.  Just kiddin'. I got a girl!  Lady Rainicorn, yeah! Hmm, that don't look right.  That's better. 
Little Buddy|  Excuse me?
Jake| Hmm?
Little Buddy| Down here. Hi!
Jake|  Oh my fun. I thought you was a rock.
Little Buddy| I'm not a rock. I'm a Little Buddy. Can you get off me, please?
Jake| Whoops!  Sorry.
Little Buddy|  It's okay.
Jake| Cool. You wanna be friends?
Little Buddy| I'd like that. I've never had a friend.
Jake| Whoa. Seriously?
Little Buddy| My species spends its first twelve years sleeping. I just woke up today! 
Jake|  Hello?  I'm just gonna pretend you're sleeping. 
Finn|  Whoop! She's here.
BMO| I thought my body was hopping up and down. But I was sitting still.
Lady| 가지고 왔어! 
Finn| What is it, Lady?
Lady|  옛날에 조슈아가 만든 테잎이야. 제이크가 그 위에 그냥 녹음해버려서 기억하고 있어. 그 앞쪽은 보지 말고 그냥 빨리 돌려! 
Finn| What?
Lady|  앞쪽 보지 말고 그냥 빨리 달.. 돌리라구. 
Finn| Eh, something skip? I don't know. Just play it, BMO.
Joshua|  Jake? Finn? Jermaine? Whoever is watching this?
Finn| Dad!
Joshua|  I just opened up an unexplored cavern deep in the underground grasslands complex. Please refer to my chart system, okay? I'm in cave 73H. In case I am overtaken by an enemy I need you to retrieve my corpse.
Jake|  Hey, Lady. You asked me to make you a video.
Lady|  돌려! 돌려!! 
Finn| BMO! Skip!  Skip!!
Jake|  ...saying JTD won't change his doggy ways.
Finn|  That should be good.
Jake|  Okay, I love you girl. I hope you liked it. Bye! 
Joshua|  Over here, you see, the second half of the tablet I believe. Now, if I put this together with mine, I should be able to create a portal to the demon Kee-Oth's dimension and trap him in a circle of holy water. Okay, here we go.  Perfect. Okay, let's see.  Kee-Oth zaple myrups pama...
Jake|  Okay, this is scene one and take one of Heat Signature 2. Ready? Action!
BMO| Father, it has been a year since I was on the submarine, but, I still hear the screams! I was forced to choose; the lives of my men, or the entire planet! What would you do? Tell me father! I'm a mess, man!
Shelby| Wait, what do I say? Mmmm, Check please-
Jake| No!
Finn| Hold on, BMO, I feel like we should watch more of this video for clues, but you gotta promise me that I'm not going to see more weird Jake stuff.
Lady|  더이상 제이크가 이상한 짓 하는 거 없을 거야. 진짜야! 그래도 내가 이 테잎 본 지 하도 오래 돼서 장담은 못 하겠네. 미안해. 
Finn| Okay, high-five! Play it, BMO!
Jake| Hmm, guess what, Lady? This dirty dog needs a bath!
Jake| Wawoo!
Kee-Oth|  This stinks!
Jake| What'a mean?
Kee-Oth| Come on, Joshua! Back in the old days, you would have been up here trying to take me apart!
Jake| Uh, what? That's my dad, Joshua, back in the old days.
Jake| I'm his son, dude.
Kee-Oth| Shoot.
Kee-Oth| Where is he?
Jake| He's dead, dude. Don't make me get emotional about it.
Kee-Oth| Then why you being such a wimp then? Come on up here and beat on me like your dad would.
Jake| Okay, that's weird.
Kee-Oth| What's weird?
Jake| You want to get beat up? That's weird. I'm not doin' your weird biz.
Kee-Oth| You won't fight?!
Jake| Nope.
Jake| What the—!
Samantha| Hi. I'm Samantha.
Jake| I'm Jay T.—the Dog. I'm Jake.
Kee-Oth| Only one can survive my pit! This bozo tried stealing my blood too! So youse better duke it out, and see who gets to live!
Samantha| But I haven't seen a man-dog in years! And now the universe has dropped one into my arms!
Jake| Whoa, lady, no way. This boy's got.
Samantha| But fate has brought us together! The stars have paired you with a goddess.
Jake| I like the way you talk, but you are crazy.
Kee-Oth| Kill or be killed, you two!
Samantha| Yes, if I'm so crazy, then let's fight!
Jake|  No, girl, we can bounce outta here. My friend Finn will save us any second now.
Samantha| I don't wait for rescue. I conquer till I am conquered. By love... or by the hand of an adversary.
Jake| Well, I guess we're gonna have to fight then.
Kee-Oth| Okay, take your time. I gotta do my daily sun salutation.
Kee-Oth|  Release me, Joshua!  I'll show you!
Kee-Oth| Dude, your blood is harsh!
Joshua| That's because I've been drinking so much holy water. It's in my blood, sucka! And naturally, I gotta go to the bathroom like crazy. Be right back!
Kee-Oth| If I can't suck you, I'll suck myself's blood.
Kee-Oth| Hehehe...Taste it, scrub!  AUGH!
Joshua|  Man, I can't believe it...I gotta wee-wee again!
Beemo| Would you like to rate this video?
Finn| No time, Beemo.  Let's go find the cave from the video. Maybe we'll find more clues there.
Lady| 잠깐! 내가 네 주위에 보호막 쳐야 돼! 
Lady| 됐다. 이제 가도 돼. 
Finn| Kee Oth Zaple Myrups Rama Mancakes?
Finn| Whoa.
Finn| Jake?  Yeesh.
Kee-Oth| Eh?
Finn| Jake?
Jake| Finn, yes! Help me!
Lady| Jake! 왜 저 못생긴 지지배가 널 껴안고 있는거야! 
Jake| This isn't hugging—it's fighting! Fighting!
Finn| Jake, what do I do? Should I kill him?
Kee-Oth| With what?
Finn| With this! 
Kee-Oth| Demon blood...
Finn| That's right! Demon blood beats demon!
Jake| No, that is not correct!
Kee-Oth| Hahahaha! Oh yeah! Gimme that blood, stupid!
Finn| Lady! Don't break the circle of protection!
Lady| 당연하지! 
Finn|  Aw geez, he's sucking my sword off its hilt!
Kee-Oth| Yeah, hahaha! Your circle can't stop my sucking! Now I have your demon blood as well!
Finn| Except it's not demon blood! It's a frozen grape juice that was blessed by the priest.
Finn|  Bless this sword, fodder.
Shelby| Mmm, check please!
Finn|  Mmm, grape-y!
Kee-Oth| Wait...  Aaaaaah!
Jake| My blood! Woo!
Samantha| Coward!
Jake| Woop! Hey, hey! Lady! 
Finn| Let's go, bros!
Jake| Samantha, you can come too, I guess.
Samantha| Very well.
Samantha| You've returned me to my world, so I recant my oath to destroy you.
Jake| You made an oath. Okay.
Samantha|  Let's fight again some time.
Jake| Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree.
Samantha| Hmm. Took you long enough to stretch outta that pit. 
Lady| 뭐, 뭐가 어떻게 된 거야? 너 저 여자한테 반한 거야 뭐야! 
Jake| Pshh, please! Not even.
Lady| 그럼 그 함정에서 왜 그렇게 오래 버티고 있었어? 
Jake| Uh, because... Kee-Oth was right there! An-and there were traps! I didn't have no blood this whole time, so I'm totally out of it. 
Lady, Finn| Jake!
Jake| Woo...Sorry, I got a little light-headed.
Lady| 아, 이 말썽꾸러기. 사랑해 자기야. 
Jake| I love you too, Lady.
Finn| Yo, guys, I still love Flame Princess.
Jake| Okay, big hug!
Finn, Jake and Lady| Hug!
Princess Bubblegum| I can't believe I let you talk me into this. It's not like I have a lot of free time, you know.
Marceline| Peebs, you work too much. Imagine a pizza. Only half should be business. The rest should be personal. Personal pizza.
Princess Bubblegum| Yuck.
Marceline| Try to have fun tonight.
Princess Bubblegum| With the Ice King? Not in your everlasting lifetime, girlfriend.
Marceline| I wish you'd call him Simon. He's actually kind of sweet and funny.
Marceline| Can you please try to get along tonight? It would mean a lot to me.
Princess Bubblegum| I'll try.
Ice King| Try anything once, that's what I say.
Marceline| Simon! What's this?
Ice King| It's a present. To bribe you for coming over.
Marceline| You don't have to bribe us, silly. We're here because we want to hang out with you.
Ice King|" No one has ever said that to me before. You didn't say, ""No take backs."""
Marceline| Bottoms down.
Ice King| So, check it out! I upgraded my home karaoke system. Do you like karaoke?
Marceline| Duh! We love karaoke. Bonnie is a dynamo on the mike! Okay. You guys get started, I'll freshen up PB's drink.
Princess Bubblegum| Marceline?
Ice King| Irslerskat prjon! Prjon, prjon Prrrrrrrrrrrrjon!
Princess Bubblegum| Marceline! Get out here quick!
Marceline| What's going on?
Princess Bubblegum| Something's wrong with the I.K.
Marceline| No! Simon!
Ice King| Hi, Marceline.
Marceline| Are you guys pranking me?
Princess Bubblegum| Your friend just majorly malfunctioned! He was jerking around all weird, and his voice sounded like he was possessed!
Marceline| Cool out, B-Bell. I know you love karaoke, but you can't take it so seriously.
Ice King| I hope you like penguin cuisine. It's mostly just shapes.
Marceline| Who doesn't love a good rhomboid?
Princess Bubblegum| You're a rhomboid.
Marceline| Here, Simon. I know these are your favos.
Ice King| Thanks, Gunther!
Princess Bubblegum|" He just called you ""Gunther."""
Marceline| He calls everybody Gunther. Bonnie!
Princess Bubblegum| There's something really wrong with Simon.
Marceline| There's some wrong with Wait. You just called him Simon.
Ice King| Call me whatever you want. This is the best date I've been on since my last date.
Princess Bubblegum| This is not a date.
Ice King| Neither was the last one. It was a robbery.
Marceline| For real?
Ice King| Yeah. She stole my heart. And my crown.
Princess Bubblegum| Your crown.
Marceline| Crubs! He's really flipping out!  What'd you do that for?!
Princess Bubblegum| It just makes things easier.
Princess Bubblegum| I'm definitely seeing some weird activity here. It's really, really.
Marceline| You don't know what's going on.
Princess Bubblegum| Maybe I can access it with my VR equipment.
Marceline| Whoa, Bon-bon! This stuff is rad. Why haven't you shown me before?
Princess Bubblegum| I didn't think you liked science.
Marceline| I like games.
Princess Bubblegum| We can play sometime. But this time, it's business.
Marceline| Whoa.
Princess Bubblegum| This is not what I was expecting.
Marceline| Did you press the wrong button?
Princess Bubblegum| I never press the wrong button.
Marceline| Yeah, you always know which button to press. I'm referring to the fact that you know how to annoy me.
Princess Bubblegum| Yeah, I got that. What I don't get is this stupid scenery.
Marceline| At least it's got a pretty killer beat.
Gunther| Wow! Two newbies at the same time! How'd you manage that? Yeah, okay. I guess if you really squeeze together, it could fit you both.
Princess Bubblegum| Who are you?!
Marceline| Are you a dinosaur?
Gunther| I'm a Gunther.
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, what's a dinosaur doing here?
Gunther| I'm practicing my drums. The others say the acoustics out here are better than in town.
Marceline| What the bleep?!
Gunther| Yeah. That's been happening lately. You're lucky you didn't get rearranged. Ooof!
Princess Bubblegum| Does this circuit look infected to you?
Marceline| I don't know. I only deal in infectious grooves.
Gunther| Sounds like you guys need another brain. I'm gonna take you guys to the the professor! He's the smartest guy I know. Next to Master Evergreen, of course.
Sveinn| Prjon.
Gunther| Hey, guys.
Sveinn| Prjon. Hey, Goontz!
Marceline| Who are those dudes?
Gunther|" That's Sveinn. He only wore the crown once. And the guy next to him says he's the first ""Santa."" Like, what's even a ""Santa""?"
Marceline| Dude, the Santa?
Princess Bubblegum| Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.
Gunther| Aha! There he is! Professor Petrikov!
Marceline| Simon!
Simon Petrikov| Marcy! Dear! How is this possible? Did my beloved Betty master the secrets of the crown?
Marceline| No. Bonnibel scienced us in.
Simon Petrikov| You must be Betty's little assistant.
Princess Bubblegum| Assistant?! I have been my own boss my entire life. I built my own lab! I've created freaking life forms!
Marceline| Okay! Actually, I haven't seen Betty since she came back to Ooo.
Simon Petrikov| But if Betty didn't send you, why are you here?
Marceline| The crown is going ba-nay-nays.
Princess Bubblegum| It's making Ice King act super weird in the real world.
Simon Petrikov| Yes, I see. It seems to have infected much of the crown's labyrinth. I was actually just about to follow its path of destruction.
Gunther| A quest!
Simon Petrikov| Hey, Marcy, last time, I was so caught up in making things right with Betty that you got left out. I'm sorry.
Marceline| It's okay. I get it.
Simon Petrikov| So, you got a boyfriend yet?
Marceline| Ha! No. There was this guy once, but he was a real jerk, so I dumped him hard.
Simon Petrikov| Wish I'd been there to punch his face.
Marceline| Simon! I can punch my own jerks now.
Princess Bubblegum| It's getting pretty bad. I think we're close.
Gunther| Yeah! Can't you hear my intense drumming?
Princess Bubblegum| Magic Man?
Betty| Magic Woman.
Simon Petrikov| Betty!
Gunther| This is the fabled Betty? I always pictured her more majestic. You know, with, guts and stuff.
Simon Petrikov| Betty, please, what are you doing?
Betty| I'm re-programming the crown's wish magic. Got to fix Simon. A-ha!
Gunther| I'm a bush!
Marceline| It's just on backwards.
Princess Bubblegum| Betty's the one who's backwards. We got to get her malware out of here before she causes irreparable damage.
Princess Bubblegum| Now!
Princess Bubblegum| Now!
Marceline| Hoo!
Princess Bubblegum| Now! Aaah!
Simon Petrikov| There has to be a part of the real Betty in there somewhere, Gunther. If only I could reach out to her.
Gunther| Okay. Get in there and reach.
Simon| I think I will. Betty? I'm the reason you're doing all this.
Betty| I'm busy.
Simon Petrikov| Remember how we met? When we both reached for the same book in the library, and I said you should check it out first? And when you returned it, you left a note inside, because you knew I'd borrow it next? It was the funniest, smartest note I've ever read.
Betty| I... have to work.
Simon Petrikov| Betty, I love you so much, but you can't help me like this.
Betty| I can and I will help you, Simon!
Simon Petrikov| You remember me!
Betty| I-I
Simon Petrikov| Stay with that feeling, Betty! Stay with it! Betty!
Betty| Simon?
Simon Petrikov| Betty! I can't believe it's really you!
Betty| Technically I'm a magical A.I. avatar derived from Betty's memories.
Simon Petrikov| Close enough!
Princess Bubblegum| Shwang! The system appears to be stabilizing. Crown shields are coming back online.
Marceline| What does that mean?
Princess Bubblegum| The crown will re-seal itself off from foreign entities.
Marceline| But I-I can come back and visit Simon, right?
Princess Bubblegum| No.
Betty| What about me?
Princess Bubblegum| Don't freak out, but you're gonna be deleted.
Simon Petrikov| Oh, no!
Betty| It's okay, Simon. I'm just glad I didn't destroy your world.
Simon Petrikov| You are my world.
Gunther| Goodbye, freaks! Don't forget Gunther!
Marceline| Bye, dude. I'm gonna be nicer to penguins from now on.
Gunther| Okay. Wait, what?
Marceline| Whoa.
Betty| Before I go, there's something I have to tell you.
Simon Petrikov| Tell me, Betty.
Betty| I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I
Simon Petrikov| Betty!
Princess Bubblegum| I'm seeing remnants of Betty's program in the readouts. It's like her data left a shadow print on the circuitry.
Simon Petrikov| So, what was that thing you were gonna tell me?
Betty| I just said that for drama. I figured it would drive you crazy, but at least you'd never stop thinking about me.
Simon Petrikov| Betty, I never could.
Betty| Mwah!
Marceline| I don't see anything. These are just weird dots to me.
Ice King| My place is trashed and I can't remember a thing. Great dinner party, huh?
Princess Bubblegum| Best I've ever been to. What? I don't like relaxing; I like science.
Ice King & Abracadaniel| Road trip!
Ice King| Check out this sweet make out wagon!  Life giving magus bro!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Yo, yo, yo!
Ice King| Yo, yo.  Ron James bro!
Ron James| Whazzup!
Ice King| Not much, not much.  Finn's old hat bro!
Little Dude|" Uh, name's ""Little Dude."""
Ice King| Sure, sure.  Hey, uh..
Beau| It's Beau.
Ice King| Beau bro, right!  Leaf Man bro!  And, uh... Who's this guy?
Abracadaniel|" I don't know. We just picked him up. That's the kind of trip this is gonna be. It's a ""destiny will guide us"" kind of thing."
Ice King|  How 'bout we call you...Giuseppe.  That's right, Giuseppe.
Abracadaniel| Okay, Ron James, it's time.
Ron James| A'ight, listen up, brahs. Here's the plan. 
All| Ooooh.
Ron James| We're heading for Big Butt Rock. At sundown, we'll gather on the Cheek's Peak, and using the ah-has, deep feels, and woo-woos we score from the journey, we will chant a totally original spell, thus forming an entirely new school of magic!  Kind of like those jerky secret societies, but less jerky. 
Abracadaniel| Just got one more stop. 
Ice King| Finn and Jake's crib? They won't come. They're out of our league.
Finn|  Hey, Abracadaniel's here, with a bus full of lame wizards.
Jake|  Here we go. They're probably gonna try to lure us on some dumb trip.
Abracadaniel| Hey, water nymphs! Uh...hi. Uh...do you girls feel like, uh...going on a road trip?
Nymph| Um...no thanks.
Abracadaniel| Okay, but what if I...
Nymph| Ew.
Ron James|  Hey, ladies! Hellooo.
Nymph| Whoa, do you guys know this person?
Denise| No, but his eyes are just... gorge.
Jake| Oh.
Abracadaniel| Here we go!
All| Wooo! 
Ice King| Uh, why'd we stop?
Abracadaniel| I think we ran out of gas.
Little Dude|  And the wheels fell off!
Ron James| Well, this ain't goin' the way we planned, but fate has decreed that this place is just what we need. Draw your inspiration from this muddy, old cow pasture. Here, bros.  We got a stock full of T.P. and magic ink. 
Abracadaniel| Let's all write down arcane, cryptic words in unexpected new combinations and patterns. Maybe the nymphs can dance on top of the bus to be, like, our muses.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Inspire us, water nymphs!
Nymph| We don't want to. We'd rather write.
Ice King| I'll dance if dancing is needed.  Doo-doo doo doo-doo. Yah yah, doo-doo wah  Dance, dance, dancin' dance writing.  I'm dance, dance, dance, dancin'. Top of the bus, window...
Little Dude| Hey, check it out, y'all. The dirty old stranger's writing, too. 
Farmer| What's all the ruckus?! I own this pasture, so get back in your vehicle and get! 
Ice King| We can't! Our wheels fell off!  Back on the vehicle. I'll make a slick ice road. 
Farmer| Are you gone? I can't really see!
Ice King|  Oh! 
Abracadaniel| Is there a problem?
Ice King| I ran out of juice.
Abracadaniel| Can I take over?
Ice King| Yeah, maybe you should. Hey, let's switch headgear.  Ooh, it fits!  Yeah, girl, just let the ice magic flow.  Oh, b-but be careful, okay?
Abracadaniel| What? 
Ice King| Oh!  Not me.  Nice ice road.
Abracadaniel| Thanks. Hey, I don't think we're moving.
Ice King| Uh, hold on.  Everyone, time to push the bus!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Eh, I don't really want to.
Ice King| Come on! Destiny!  Okay, back on the bus! Back on the bus!  Huh? Ooh, a crabapple tree. Giuseppe, make yourself useful and grab us some of them crabapples.  Okay, get ready. Jump! 
Little Dude| Oh, no! Giuseppe can't catch up!
Ice King| What?! Magus of Life Giving, take the wheel! 
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Uh, okay, but I am not a confident driver.
Little Dude|  You're doing great, buddy.
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Don't touch me! 
Ice King|" Giuseppe, throw the crabapples!  Giuseppe?  We have lost Giuseppe.  Mm! Hmm? Well, let's see what old Giuseppe wrote.  Listen to this, everybody! ""These are not my tear drops, daughter dear, but just a sheen of dew that lingers here, past other fields where other fathers lie, who kept their daughters better far than I.""  What do you guys think?  What's wrong with you guys?"
Ron James| Look who's talking.
Ice King|"  Huh?  This is true art.  Well, let's see what you other guys wrote.  Little Dude, here's yours. ""Days don't have shades, directions with no ways, adjusting minimum scholarly curriculum to enrich empty minds, it takes refracted sunshines."" That is awesome. ""Take this light with your great might, free hearts that are gated seeing truth in things exaggerated."" Ah, some interesting spell combos going on guys."
Abracadaniel| Ice King! I see the Butt Rock!
Ice King| The hour of glory is upon us. Cauldron! 
Abracadaniel| Smells so good down here! What's cooking? 
Nymph| Girls, we can help.  Okay, one, two, three! Lift! Ow! Ow. Um...let's get out of here. 
Ice King| No, don't go.  Hey, I could freeze all of us. Then we'd be safe from drowning, and once someone discovers our preserved bodies, we'll be saved! Be like, 200 years, tops! 
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Oh! Let me try this!  Mommy!
Bus| Oh Grob, I can't swim! Aah! Oh Glob!
Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving| Ymmom! Somebody! Sorry.
Ron James|" I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. My ""last resort"" poshe, obtained from a mad yogi in the Mystery Mountains. It's time to find out what it does.  Ba-bam! "
Tree Trunks| Nice and slow. Ooh, gent--oh! 
Tree Trunks|  Oh, I'm flying!
Ice King|  Yoink. Take my head away from here, baby!  No! 
Abracadaniel| Maybe this is a test from destiny, guys! If we all just surrender to these events, the answer will reveal itself.  Whoa.
Little Dude| Wha?  Hey, it's Giuseppe! 
Ice King|  Giuseppe, how have you done this? 
All| Whoa.
Abracadaniel| What was he?
Ice King| I don't know, Abracadaniel, but I think he was trying to show us something. Something new. 
2 Wizards| Sploo! Jicka haka boogy noona hubba gubba--secret wizard handshake!
Berdzerd| Later, Chinchizerd!
Chinchizerd| Bye, Berdzerd.  See you at the secret thing tonight!  Loser.
Ice King|  Giuseppe.
Jake|  Loot, bro!
Finn| Gear dumped, bro!  How about this room, bro?
Jake|  Looks like a brolicious room to relax in and play video games... bro.
Finn| Home, sweet home, bro.
Ice King|  Yeah, you said it. I've been home this whole time.
Jake|   I keep forgetting that he lives here now.
Finn|  Just until Gunter finishes rebuilding the Ice Kingdom.
Ice King|" What y'all whisperin' about?  Hehe! Ex-""squeeze"" me. "
Jake|  Ice King, we've told you a thousand times this couch ain't for cuddlin'.
Ice King| Sure it is.
Jake| It isn't!
Ice King| Mm, it's cozy.
Finn|  It's not that bad, Jake.
Ice King| See?
Jake|  Finn, can I speak to you in the kitchen?
Ice King| Oh, hey, Jake, can you bring me a sandwich?  Sandwich?
Jake| It's time to kick Ice King out!! 
Ice King|  Don't forget the bread! Haha!
Finn|  Look, I hear you. But we can't kick him out because I still feel guilty about junking up his crib. Hey, what if we check him into a hotel room?
Jake| Hmmm? 
Finn| What's that?
Jake| Checking him to a hotel room.
Ice King| Oooh! Sandwich time! 
Finn| Hey, Simon, how would you like to stay in the Coolest Hotel?
Jake| Lumpy Space Princess stays there. That's how cool it is.
Finn| We'll even put you up for few weeks until your place is ready.
Ice King|" Ahh, but that sounds lonely. I just like to stay here with you guys! Having roommates is nice! It keeps me out of my head. Gunther says only ""Wenk!"" What's up with that?"
Finn| Hehe, yeah?
Jake| Finn, I'm ready to murder the Ice King.
Finn| No. I-I have another idea.
Ice King| Oop. 
Finn| Oh, my gosh! Someone's at the door. We have a doorbell now. We'll get it.
Finn and Jake| Abracadaniel?!
Finn| What are you doing here? 
Abracadaniel| What? You kept calling and call... 
Jake| Hahaha! Shut up-up-up-up-up, Abracadeez!
Finn| Yeah, man! You don't even need a reason to stop by! 
Jake| A sexy wizard like you goes where he wants!
Ice King|  Whoa-oh! I see what's going on!
Jake| What... You do? 
Ice King| Yeah! This wizard donk  is trying to jack my Tree House styles, just 'cause he beat me that one time at Wizard Battle! And if he takes one step closer, I'll bust him up one real good! I never asked to be... 
Finn|  Come on, dude, we got cookies and the cocoa!   Dang! But you're funny, Abracadaniel!
Abracadaniel| I didn't say anything.
Finn|  Fantastic.
Jake| Hey, Abadabs!  Why don't you show us that trick you're working on! 
Abracadaniel|" Oh? Uhh. Yeah! I suppose I could!  ""Shirmo lock kanta Floriana"" "
Finn| So good! Whoo!
Jake|  You're a good wizard!
Abracadaniel| I don't know, it's dumb! I'm still working on it! It's-It's nothing!
Ice King| Oh, you're right that ain't nothing! Check out this wizar!  Whoa!  What?
Abracadaniel|  Ohh! You're the greatest wizard ever!
Ice King| Well, maybe not ever ever! Am I the greatest wizard in our generation? Yes. 
Jake|  This was a great idea, man! It's like he's forgotten all about us!
Finn| Uhh-huh. Pretty soon, he'll be outta here for good.
 Jake| For good!
Finn|  Yeah!
Ice King|  Finn!! Jake!! Come quick!! It's an emergency!! Hurry!! 
Finn| Ice King? What's up?  Huh? What the flip?
Ice King| Tada!
Jake| How'd they get the other couch down here?
Abracadaniel| There you are, sir. There you are.  Right this way.
BMO| You made it!
Abracadaniel| Caw! Tada!
BMO|   A bird! He's a bird!
Abracadaniel| I've always been into interpretive dance. But I've never been able to find a musician who could match my energy until now! 
Jake| Huh! He's actually not bad!
BMO|   Dance party! 
Abracadaniel| No! 
BMO| Awww! 
Abracadaniel| No! 
BMO| Ow!  No!
Abracadaniel| Ow! Why are you doing this?!
BMO| You pushed my whole body!
Finn| Um,  whoo! That was great, guys!
Abracadaniel| Yeah? You guys liked it?
Ice King| Well, then the second and third acts are gonna knock your socks off!
Finn| Uh,  actually, Jake and I have got, uh, got some stuff to take care of.
Jake| Yeah...  It's getting pretty late.
Abracadaniel| Uh... oh, Glob.
Finn| 'Sup, ABD?
Abracadaniel| I just remember that I'm, uh, a-allergic, uh, to, to the night sky.
Finn| You're afraid of the dark?
Abracadaniel| Yes, if I ever had to walk, uh, outside at night, I might die of-of...
Ice King|  Of fright.
Abracadaniel| Of fright!
Finn| Gee. Well, I guess you can crash here for the night.
Abracadaniel| All right!
Ice King and Abracadaniel|  Sleepover!!
Finn| Wait! Are you really afraid of the dark?
Abracadaniel| Maybe.
Finn| Okay. Well, you can sleep on the couch. We're gonna go. Uh, good night. 
Abracadaniel|  Whoa!
Ice King| See, I told you! Isn't it awesome? Eh, since I'm pretty much in charge here, we can totally take all this treasure if we wanted to.
Abracadaniel| Ha! Totally!
Abracadaniel| Wow! Cool! 
Ice King| Oh, that's just a byncomire.
Abracadaniel| Ohh!
Ice King| Wanna see something really cool?
Abracadaniel| Yeah!
Ice King| Okay, but you gotta promise not to freak out!
Ice King| This is Joshua the Dog's Demon Blood Sword.
Ice King| Yeah! It's a real demon blood sword.
Abracadaniel| What?!
Ice King| And you see these words?  If you say them out loud, you can actually see a vision of the demon whose blood was used to make the sword!
Abracadaniel| No way! That sounds awesome! Too bad neither of us can read Demon Runes.
Ice King| Ooh! I know how! Butyrum lac surepo kee oth pradium, like that!
Ice King| Oops.
Abracadaniel| Wow! It looks so real!
Kee-Oth| I am real!
Kee-Oth| Bring me the true bearer of my blood sword or I will destroy you both!
Ice King| Come on, best friend,  let us not betray Finn! Let's fight Kee-Oth ourselves!
Abracadaniel| Nobody can defeat us if we work together! Super Wizard Team Up!
Kee-Oth| You're wasting your powers on me. Haha!
Ice King| Oh! No! Oh, no! He's too powerful!
Finn and Jake| Kee-Oth!
Kee-Oth| Joshua!
Finn and Jake| Kee Oth Rama Pancake...
Kee-Oth| Don't say another word, Joshua! Or the throats are going to get it! If you speak the words to banish me, I'll reduce your friends to ash!
Jake| Kee Oth Rama P... 
Finn| Dude!!
Jake| I thought he was bluffing.
Kee-Oth| I'm not bluffing, Joshua! If you do not willingly return my stolen blood, I will destroy him  and him. 
Finn| Ahh! The sword!
Jake| Scary!
Finn| I just can't do it, Jake. This is Dad's sword!
Jake| You don't have any other choice! Do it!
Kee-Oth| Do it!!
Finn| Whoa.
Finn| You got your blood, now get outta here!
Kee-Oth|  All right, I'll go. Psych! Got you now, Joshua! 
Abracadaniel|  Uh, hey, so, uh, I should be getting home.
Ice King|  Uh, yeah, me, too. Hey, Abracadaniel, wanna hang out at my place?
Abracadaniel| I thought your house broke.
Ice King| Ice Kingdom's been rebuilt for weeks!
Finn| Jake?
Finn| Tree Trunks! The slumber party is about to start. Get those hot buns in here, girl!
Finn|" Did you hear me? I said, ""Get those hot—""!"
Finn| Hi, Mr. Pig.
Finn| Why are you hitting me?
Finn| I was just talking about Tree Trunks's hot—.
Princess Bubblegum| Come on, Finn! We're doing music chairs.
Chet| Everyone ready?
Everyone| Ready!
Chet| Take a seat!
Princess Bubblegum| Uh, uh...
Finn| Uh-oh, uh-oh!
Mr. Cupcake| There's a seat by me.
Finn & Princess Bubblegum| Oh! Heh.
Finn| You take it, Princess. This is your party.
Princess Bubblegum| You take it, Finn. You're my guest.
Finn & Princess Bubblegum| No, no, I insist!
Chet| Time is up. You two must now be sent to the closest closet to have heavenly thoughts.
Chet| Heavenly thoughts. 
Finn| Hey, PB.
Princess Bubblegum| Hey, Finn.
Finn|  Mm?
Princess Bubblegum| Bup, bup, bup. Hey, you wanna ditch the party and go for a walk?
Finn| Wha—? Really?
Princess Bubblegum| It's been a while since we just hung out, you know?
Finn| What about the Candy People?
Princess Bubblegum| Ah, they should be fine, right? For once? Maybe they'll surprise me by being fine. Come on. 
Finn| Whoa!
Princess Bubblegum| Secret passage.
Finn| Noice.
Manfried| Boy, it's sure quiet in there. What's going on in there, you think?
Crunchy| Someone should listen at the door.
Mr. Cupcake| We nominate you, Crunchy, to go listen at the door.
Dr. Donut| And tell everybody what's going on.
Crunchy| Eh, what? Why me?
Starchie| Come on, Crunchy. You're the go-to guy. You're the new Cinnamon Bun. 
Crunchy| No, I'm not. 
Gumdrop Lass 1| What do you hear?
Dr. Donut| Yeah, paint us a picture, Crunchy.
Crunchy| I hear, like, uh, like, a lush, green field... next to a white picket fence. Finn and the princess both brought picnic baskets. Oh, but they brought the same stuff, and they're laughing about it. And now they're kissing.
Chocoberry| There's no lush, green field in that closet!
Crunchy| Well, you guys asked me to paint a picture.
Chocoberry| Just tell us what you hear!
Crunchy| I can't hear anything. They must be just lightly brushing their lips together.
Starchie| Or... maybe they kissed so much they passed out! Crunchy, open that door!
Mr. Cupcake| Step aside, Crunchy. I'll make short work of this door opening.  Oh. I guess I'm just too strong. 
Gumdrop Lass 1|  Then they're trapped! What if they ran out of air?
Mr. Cupcake| No air? I'll smash down the door!
Chet| Stop!
Mr. Cupcake| Huh?
Chet| Mr. Cupcake, your mighty strength might kill them! There's a drill and saw in the supply room, though.
Mr. Cupcake| In here, you say? 
Candy People| No, don't!
Candy People| Aw...
Jake|" Yo, guys! You gotta do something! That's my best friend in there!  ""You okay in there?"""
Finn|  Yeah, we went out the secret coat passage.
Princess Bubblegum| It's so nice to get away sometimes.
Finn| Hmm. Candy peeps can be a handful, huh? 
Princess Bubblegum| Yeah. They mean well, though. You wanna meet Timmy?
Princess Bubblegum|  Timmy!
Finn| Aw! So squish!
Princess Bubblegum| Hop on!
Finn| Okay. 
Candy People| Breathe!
Candy People| Breathe!
Candy People| Breathe!
Chet| Wait. Wait! Don't Candy People breathe out, like, poisonous gas or something? Something like...  carbo... carrin dio—
Jake| I know! It's called...  And it is deadly.
Chocoberry| Suck it back out! Suck it back out!
Chet| Cupcake's dead! What do we do?!
Jake| Ha-a. 
Princess Bubblegum| So got any other weekend plans?
Finn| Mmm... probably gonna hit up the arts and crafts kingdom with BMO. You?
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, I'm gonna garden some, plan next week's pizza lunch, answer 800 e-mails, and... you know, whatever.
Finn| Wows. Do you ever get tired from doing princess work all the time?
Princess Bubblegum| Sure. I mean, it's a lot of responsibility  looking after so many people, though lately I have been trying to be more chill about it. 
Finn| Cool, like taking ice cream breaks?
Princess Bubblegum|" Yeah, and, like, being more... sorta okay with everyone making mistakes around me. Like ""mind my own stuff"" more. You know what I mean?"
Finn| Yeah. Kind of like how I've been thinking about my dad and how I want him to act more like daddy. But, but maybe acting like daddy just isn't what he does. Maybe my dad's not a dad but a kid stuck in a dad's body.
Finn|  Timmy knows what's up!
Princess Bubblegum| Timmy!
Finn & Princess Bubblegum| Timmy!
Manfried| Okey-dokey, everybody! Check it out!
Manfried| Once in place, this sweater will muffle the cannonball explosion perfectly, allowing the frame around the door to gently fall apart, freeing Finn and PB.
Mr. Cupcake| Manfried's a good leader because we can always see him.
Manfried| Now the cannon should go right over here.  Oh, wait. Here. 
Chocoberry| Aren't you worried about Finn?
Jake| Of course I am! See these tears of worry? 
Chocoberry|  It will be okay, Jake.
Finn| PB is showing me all this cool stuff. She has an awesome shirt. How's the party?
Manfried| Okay, everyone, prepare for the boom.
Manfried| Three... two...
Colonel Candy Corn| Fire!
Colonel Candy Corn| Aw, my cannon.
Manfried| Uh-oh.
Banana Guard| Hey, the closet's open!
Crunchy| So they're dead, right?
Ice Cream Guy| Chocoberry can tell us! She saw a ghost at my house once.
Chocoberry| Oui, it's true. I have the gift.  Yes. I sense their spirits.
Chocoberry|" Finn says... He says, ""Remember to feed BMO."" "
Colonel Candy Corn| That idea stank, Manfried! I'm calling the shots from now on.
Mr. Cupcake| No! Manfried is still the most clearly visible.
Jake| Hey, why don't you guys team up and fight each other to see who gets to wear the crown. 
Princess Bubblegum| Here, try this one.
Finn|  Mmm... fire.
Princess Bubblegum|  You got a little edible fire mustache there.
Finn| What?  Gonna send this to Jake. 
Jake| Check it out.
Princess Bubblegum| Hey, what's that?
Finn| Uh, it's—
Princess Bubblegum| Let me see.
Finn| Mm. You won't like it, but okay. 
Princess Bubblegum| I'll worry about it later.
Finn| Oh.
Princess Bubblegum| You wanna see the burrito room?
Finn| Yuss!
Colonel Candy Corn| This is a brutal new society. For a society to function, it needs rules. 1. You must drink tea with your pizza. 2. Pizza can only be eaten alone. 3. If a pizza is found in a field, you must make the next person you see holding a glass of milk eat it.
Crunchy| Sire, I must congratulate you on becoming princess.
Colonel Candy Corn| Thank you.
Crunchy| Is there anything I can do or get for you?
Colonel Candy Corn| Anything?
Crunchy| Anything.
Colonel Candy Corn| Could you perhaps procure a pizza?
Crunchy|  Yes. 
Jake| Man, this is intense. I better do something! 
Finn| Thanks for showing me around, PB. I've enjoyed just, just hanging out.
Princess Bubblegum| Me, too!
Finn|  Jake just sent me a funny picture of himself. 
Princess Bubblegum| Whoa. It looks like the Candy People's makeshift government has been taken over by a ruthless despot.
Finn| What? Why aren't you freaking out?
Princess Bubblegum| Eh, it was worth giving them a shot. Let's go back to the party, though. It looks like we have to save it.
Colonel Candy Corn| Neigh! Whinny!
Candy People|  Crunchy! Crunchy! Crunchy!
Crunchy| To the crater!
Crunchy| Any last words, Starchie?
Starchie| You smell.
Crunchy| Throw him in!
Princess Bubblegum| What's going on here?
Candy People| Uh...
Jake| They devolved into beasts. It has hilarious.
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, everybody get into your sleeping bags, and I'll read you a story.
Princess Bubblegum|  Modern menswear can be traced back two hundred years. Furs and textiles became easier to produce...
BMO| Kya! Kya!  Hmm.
BMO| Ohhh, that's pretty good. Kya! 
Jake|  BMO... keep it down!
BMO| But you said 800 to 1000 is my time to do karate. It's my karate time!
Jake| I know, but I got a headache, and I'm in a funky mood.
Finn| What's wrong, dude?
Jake| I don't know. I think I got restless leg syndrome.
Finn| Is that from getting chubby?
Jake| What? No, man, it's just restless leg.
Finn| Oop! My bad.
Jake| What are you reading?
Finn| This old copy of Adventure Boy magazine—the only magazine for boy adventurers. This kid Rusty is getting chased down the river by three grown otters. This magazine rules! But I'm saving the end for tomorrow. 
Jake| Cool.
Finn| Well, I hope your leg feels better. I'm turning in. I'll see you up there.
BMO|  Jake...
Jake| No, BMO.
BMO| KYA! 
Jake|  No, BMO! No more!  Maybe some soup will take the edge off.
Jake| Ew! Gross! Nasty!  Hyah!
Jake| I'm sorry you were born a fly and I had to kill you, you disgusting, disgusting creature.
BMO| Kya! Kya! Kya!
Jake| BMO, PLEASE!
Jake|  Finn, was that you?
Jake|  Probably just BMO or something.
Jake| That's weird. BMO doesn't like 30's jazz.  Yeesh. Creepy. 
Jake|   I didn't know we had one of those.
Voice|  Oooooo...
Jake|  Hey, hey. Hey, who?
Jake| Aah!
Ghost Fly| Ooooooo...
Jake| Hey! I killed you!
Jake| Aah!  Aah! Ghost fly touching me!  Finn! Finn!
Finn|  Aah!
Jake| Ghost fly, man! Aah! Aah!
Finn| Okay.
Jake| Come on, man. Let's get out of the house. It's a ghost fly!
Finn| So what?
Jake| No, man, ghost flies are filthy! They carry diseases, such as tuberculosis, polio, dysentery. They leave those little fly doodies on your soul.
Jake| Aah!
BMO| Finn, Jake! What's wrong?!
Finn & Jake| Ghost fly!
Jake|  Thank goodness we lost him. He's gone.
Ghost Fly| Whoo. 
BMO| Run! Just run!
Finn| Ay-ay-ay-ay!
BMO| Hmm.  Kya! Kya!
Jake| We should ask what its unfinished business is. Ghosts always have unfinished business.
Finn| Ghost fly, what's your problem?!
Finn| Come on, dude. Tell us your unfinished business!
Finn| Aah! It's no good. He's a tortured little spirit. We need help to communicate with this ghost fly.
Jake| Nah, man, let's just get someone to banish it—someone with serious paranormal juice. 
BMO| Is he coming soon?
Jake| I think so. His ways are kind of mysterious.
Finn| That's cool.
Ghost Fly| Woo?
Peppermint Butler| Let's get this ritual rolling. I got stuff to do.
Ghost Fly| Woo! 
Peppermint Butler| Hey! No! Unclean demon, feel the sting of holy water! 
Jake|  Thank you.
Peppermint Butler|  These circles will protect you from the ghost's attacks while I prepare the banishing ritual. Worry not, fellow believers, for in this bag, I possess all the darkest and most powerful tools of magic ever to be assembled in one place. We're perfectly safe—as long as...  we... have...
Jake| Well, huh. How about that? No biggie. We'll just hang out inside these magic circles until morning. That's when ghosts go to sleep. Yep. Just got to make it... till morning.
Ghost Fly| Woo! 
Finn| Hmm?
Finn|  The end of my story. And it's so close.
Jake| Don't do it, bro. It's a trap.
Finn| I know. It's an obvi trap. But wait. What if... watch this. Ha!  Mm?
Jake| Dude, what are you—?
Finn| If I extend the circle...  farther... I can get closer to the magazine.
BMO| Theoretically, that is possible.
Jake|" Yeah, but I'm still getting a ""woo-jah"" feeling. This seems like a bad idea."
Finn| Just have to stay inside this circle.
Finn| Ha ha! How'd you do it, Rusty? How'd you shake them otters?   Man, what a great ending! 
Jake| Finn? What's wrong, buddy?
Finn|  
Jake| Oh, Finn, you're disgusting!
Jake| Aw, that's it! I've had it with this ghost fly! I wish I were a ghost so I could punch him with my ghost fist!
BMO| Jake, I have a radical option. I've been studying a karate move that could temporarily stop your heart long enough for you to fight the ghost on his own plane of existence.
Jake| What?
BMO| It's okay! I learned it out of a magazine.
Jake|  Finn...  All right. But first you got to give me some unfinished business so I can come back as a ghost.
BMO| Tell me a joke.
Jake| Okay. What do you call a bear that only attacks guys named Paul?
BMO| Kya! 
Jake|  
BMO| I killed Jake! Yay, BMO!
Ghost Jake| Whoa! BMO, you killed me. Whoa. Wow. Wow! 
BMO| Jake! I can't hear you! I will start your heart up in five minutes, okay?  This many!
Jake| Okay. Five minutes. Whoa.
Jake| Is this some kind of low-level dead world? That's a bummer.
Jake| Aah!
Jake| Aah! Oh, stuff! Aah!
Jake| Ohh! Ohh! Get away! 
Jake| Aah! You killed it! Aah!
Jake| Aah! Aah! Get away!
Ghost Soup| Oooooo...
Ghost Fly|  Hmm?
Ghost Soup| Hoooooo!
Jake| That's right. You never finished the soup. That's your unfinished business!
Ghost Fly|  Woo-woo.
Jake| And now that you've finished it, you get to ascend to a glorious, new peaceful realm.
Jake|  Ahhh. Bam!  Shouldn't have tried to kill me, son!  Yes!  What's happening? Oh, BMO must be bringing me back! Yes! Yeah, BMO!
Jake| Mm. BMO?
Finn| Jake, I missed you, bro!
BMO| Jake!
Finn| Don't ever leave me again!
Jake| Good job, BMO! You brought me back.
BMO|  Yes. Yay, BMO. BMO is so good.
Doctor Princess| Whew!
Finn|   He's heading for that cube. Come on, Jake.
Jake|  Oh, yeah.
Finn|  Whaaaat?!?! He's gone!
Jake|  What?! What happened?!
Prismo|  Hey, hey! Did you guys see that? You know that was a ghost wearing a dead guy? That might be the nastiest thing I've ever seen. Na-na-na-na-nasty! Nasty jazz! Nast-- 
Jake|  Hey, hey! Easy, buddy! That's our friend Billy! He got possessed by the Lich! 
Prismo|  Oh! Sorry, sorry! I didn't mean nothin' by it! I mean, I have a lot of nasty friends. My uncle is nasty. I'm basically honorary nasty.
Finn|   Do you know where he went? We have to find our friend.
Prismo|  Who knows?
Finn|   Uh. Oh.
Prismo|  Actually, it depends on the wish I granted him.
Finn|"  ""Wish""? "
Prismo|  Yeah, he wished for the extinction of all life and I did it. I guess it changed his timeline or something?
Finn|  WHAT?!?! OH GLOB!
Jake|  Whoa, wait a minute. How can that be if I'm still here kickin' it with my main man, Finn?
Prismo|  Oh, that's because you're safe in my time room until you make your wish.
Finn & Jake|   Ohhhh.
Jake|  I wish that life wasn't anymore extinc—
Finn|   Whoa! Wait, Jake. Don't mess this up. Think about it if we wish everything back to normal, the Lich could just jazz it up again.
Jake|  Oh yeah. Jazz.
Finn|  Hmmmm. 
Jake|  Hmmmm.
Finn|  I got it! I wish... the Lich... never... even ever existed!
Farmworld Finn|  Mom? Mom, what's wrong?
Finn's mom|   Finn, I need you to do something for me. It's very important.  I need you to take the mule into town and sell him for as much as you can.
Farmworld Finn|  What! Sell Bartram?  But, I love Bartram. What the heck, Mom!
Finn's Mother|  Shhh! Finn please, just do as I say. 
Trami|   Got it?
Farmworld Finn|   Dad?
Trami|  I push you, you fall down. 
Farmworld Finn|  The Destiny Gang?
Finn's Mother|  Everything will be fine, Finn, I promise. Now just do as I say. 
Farmworld Finn|    I'm sorry, Bartram. I guess Dad must be in real trouble to be doin' this. But, I bet there's a lot o' fine folk lookin' to buy a good mule. Why, I bet I could even come visit sometimes. Won't that be swell, Bartram?  Bartram? Dang it Bartram! Bar Bar!  What the- Bar Bar, how'd ya get up there?  Whoa!  Jake, look! Golden crown! Unbelievable! We can sell it and keep Bartram! Bong, bong. 
Farmworld Marceline|   Hold it right there!
Farmworld Finn|  Who are you?!
Farmworld Marceline|  I'm a thousand years old and this is my crown!
Farmworld Finn|  Okay, okay! But, um, maybe I could just borrow it for a little while. 
Farmworld Marceline|  Noooo! No! Noo! This crown is magic. Bad, terrible magic. Too dangerous for mortal fingies like yours!  One thousand years ago, my beloved friend Simon Petrikov gave his life to save this foolish, unworthy planet from annihilation.  A frightful bomb was poised to bathe the land in mutagenic horror,  but using his mastery of ice and snow, Simon froze the bomb in mid-flight only inches from the ground, where it remains to this very day.  Today, ever ripe and ready to blow.  But he alone was not saved. Trapped under the giant weight of the enormous bomb, poor Simon perished!
Farmworld Simon|   Little help?
Farmworld Marceline|   And the horrible crown, grieving its lost master, loosed a spasm of magic so wild and crazy the entire earth was buried in ice for four hundred boring years. 
Farmworld Finn|  Uhh, none o' that is true, 'cause magic is fake. Daddy says the false prophets of old used cheap parlor tricks to control the people.  And to get babes. Like 10 or 12 hot babes each.
Farmworld Marceline|  No! Magic is real!
Farmworld Finn|  Lady! You been down here too long! Why don't you, just let me- 
Farmworld Marceline|  Step off! Or I will use this!
Farmworld Finn|  Lady! Quit it with that thing! 
Farmworld Marceline|  I'm sorry. You must DIEEEE! 
Farmworld Finn|  WAAAAAAAAAAaaaaah… ooo… uuum… 
Farmworld Marceline|  Oh, man! This thing! Dang it! 
Farmworld Finn|  Go, Jake! 
Farmworld Marceline|  Aaah! Go back to the underworld, ya beast. 
Farmworld Finn|  Sorry, gotta save my dad! 
Farmworld Marceline|  Destroy the world more like it!  Dummy. I give up.
Farmworld Simon|  The crown. Go get it.
Farmworld Marceline|  I know you're not really talking to me. I'm not crazy!
Farmworld Simon|  Get the crown! Go get it!
Farmworld Marceline|  
Farmworld Simon|  Get the crown, Marceline! Go get it!
Farmworld Marceline|  I can't. My knees!
Farmworld Simon|  Oh, that's really disappointing I must say. I'm just—uh, whatever, you're really letting me down right now.
Farmworld Marceline|  Okay, alright. 
Farmworld Finn|   Cool crown! Who wants a cool crown? I found it on a dead magician dude!
Guy #1|  I'll take it!
Farmworld Finn|  Awesome! How much cash ya got?
Guy #1|  Ohhh, I'm poor. Uh, but what about I trade you for a personal concert at your house? I'll come over later and sing ya like, four songs. I mostly do covers, but I have originals too. Do you own any spoons?
Farmworld Finn|  No.
Tromo|  Let me see that! 
Farmworld Finn|  Hey!
Tromo|  Heh!
Farmworld Finn|    Wait, Destiny Gang. I gotta sell that to pay you guys!
Tromo|  Trami, what you think? Is it my style?
Trami|  Big Destiny will know. Yo, boss! 
Big Destiny|  Snap! Huh? What is this?  Are you tellin' me what to wear, Trami?
Trami|  No, boss, you look good! 
Big Destiny|  You think I should reinvent my style and put a stupid thing on my head?!
Trami|  No, man! You tell us what to wear!
Big Destiny|  Otherwise you would dress like an idiot! Bam! Crown shorts! 
Trami & Tromo|  Amazing! 
Big Destiny|  Yeah-ha-ha!
Tromo|  Clap harder, trash bag! 
Farmworld Finn|  Okay, you guys. Gimme my money and leave my parents alone.
Tromo|  Property of old dead person go to Big Destiny.  One-arm needs to learn the rules, unless you want your butt handed to you.
Farmworld Finn|  I guess it wasn't really mine.
Farmworld Marceline|   It's mine! I'm a demon... half-demon.
Big Destiny|  Tromo! Jack up crazy lady! Trami! Take mule back to crib for din-din.
Farmworld Finn|  Whaat!  Bar Bar!
Trami|  Tough luck, One-arm! 
Big Destiny|  See you soon, bad-style Junktown! 
Farmworld Finn|  Bar Bar. 
Tromo|  End of the road, bat lady! 
Farmworld Marceline|  Oh, my bones!
Tromo|  Haha! Ah!  My eye! I will junk your face! What the! 
Choose Bruce|  Destiny gang, get outta town! We're sick of bein' bullied around! 
Tromo|  You make biiig mistake! Especially you, One-arm! 
Farmworld Finn|  My name is Finn Mertens! And tell big D I'm comin' for my stuff!
Tromo|  Ohhh, you come n' try!
Farmworld Finn|  Are you okay, lady?
Farmworld Marceline|  You must promise to—promise to return the crown to its hide-hole.
Farmworld Finn|  I promise.
Choose Bruce|  You'll need this Finn if you want to win. 
Farmworld Finn|  Choose Bruce, what is it?
Choose Bruce|  It's a weapon for your arm. With this you will defend from harm. 
Farmworld Finn|  Feels natural. Like peeing outside. Sort of.
Choose Bruce|  Best not to take the lift my friend, else the D gang'll see ya comin' in!
Farmworld Finn|  No. I want them to see me. I'm-a go up there AND SHOW THEM MY FACE!  Yaaaaaaaaaa-huh? Hello?  Bar Bar? I'm comin'! Bar bar!  I want my stuff, ya big dump! 
Big Destiny|  You want Big D's crown, huh?
Farmworld Finn|  Yeah, and Bar Bar.
Big Destiny|  Here ya go then. 
Farmworld Finn|  Wha?
Big Destiny|  That is your final possession, the last thing you will ever own.
Farmworld Finn|  What do you…mean? 
Big Destiny|  Look down there, stupid.
Farmworld Finn|   
Big Destiny|  Town is on fire! See? I made it on fire! Fix up Junktown! Look at old man cry!  That's what happens when you mess with Big D! You get crushed! Your family get crushed! Booya! 
Farmworld Finn|  Suck my shirt!  Choose Bruce!
Choose Bruce|  All my stuff is gone! Now they're goin' after your home! 
Farmworld Finn|  Bar Bar, come on!
Choose Bruce|  Hurry, Finn! You can win! 
Farmworld Marceline|  Finn! Return the—whoa! 
Farmworld Finn|  I will, but we gotta stop the Destiny gang first. Come on Jake! Good boy! 
Destiny Gang|  Destiny! Destiny! Destiny! 
Farmworld Finn|  Noooo!
Big Destiny|  Yeah! How did I even get here, son?!
Finn's Mother|  Nooo! 
Finn's Father|  Fiiinn!
Farmworld Finn|  Mom! Dad!  You said this thing is magic?
Farmworld Marceline|  Yes. Powerful and dangerous.
Farmworld Finn|  But you lost your mind in a cave.
Farmworld Marceline|  Whatever. You just gotta believe me, okay? For serious, ya donk.
Big Destiny|  I am Big D! Wooooo!
Farmworld Finn|  I believe you.
Farmworld Marceline|  You do?  Wait! Noooooo! Dang it!
Farmworld Finn|  Aaaaaah!!
Finn|  Wha—?! Jake, I told you to stop staring at me right at the time when I wake up.
Jake| I'm staring because I can't move my head.
Jake| No, really, I can't move.
Finn| I can't move either.
Jake| What's happening?!
Finn| What? What was that? Who goes there?
Jake| Hey! Who is that?
Finn| Jake, use your peripheral vision!
Jake|  Ooooh...  Ice King!
Ice King|  I shouldn't be laughing, I'm sorry. Oh, I know, I'll do the opposite.  Oh, boohoo.  Ah, this is weird.
Finn| What did you do to us, Ice King?
Ice King|" Whoa, whoa. I didn't ""do"" anything to you, okay? C'mon, guys, I'm your friend."
Jake| So why can't we move?
Ice King| Ooh, because I froze you... with this. 
Finn|  Freezing Potion A.
Ice King| I sprayed it on you while you slept.
Gunter|  Wenk! Wenk!
Ice King| No! Gunter, no! This one likes to break bottles, don't ya?  Tuck-ety tuck! Let's move to the living room.
Jake| Why are you doing this, Ice King?
Ice King| Why? Oh, because I love you guys. But you don't love me, do ya?
Jake| You tried to kill us, like, four times.
Ice King| I only try to kill you 'cause you're princess-blocking me all the time! Anyway, now that you're frozen, we can bond and stuff. And the sooner we do, the sooner I can spray you with this. 
Finn|  Unfreezing Potion A?
Ice King|" Ah, I underlined the ""un"" so I wouldn't mix 'em up."
Jake| Just unfreeze us now, man.
Finn| Yeah, 'cause we're already friends.
Ice King| We are?
Jake| Mm-hmm.
Ice King| What's my favorite color?
Finn| Uh, yellow? Orange? Blue—no, no, lavender! Lavender! Yeah!
Jake| Um, ooh, uh... rainbow?
Ice King| You don't love me. I know a lot about you guys. Jake, you don't put ice in your drink because you have sensitive teeth.
Jake| Wha—?
Ice King| And Finn, your favorite food is meatloaf.
Finn| How did you—?
Ice King| And Jake, sometimes you don't cry because you're afraid of real emotion. It's okay. Let it out.  You don't love me—  Bad penguin!
Gunter|  Wenk!
Finn| You lock your bottles?
Ice King| Huh, in this economy?  Ah, I'm gonna go make some lemonade. 
Jake| Don't touch my lemons, Ice King! Ice King!
Finn|  Jake, look!
Jake|  Gunter! No, Gunter! No!
Finn| No, Gunter, no!
Gunter| Wenk! 
Finn| No, Gunter! No!
Jake| No! Gunter! No!
Finn| Gunter, stop!
Gunter| Wenk, wenk!
Jake| What're we gonna do?!
Finn|  When someone loses one sense, their other senses are enhanced—like a blind man who can smell and hear really well. I'm gonna try using my now-enhanced brain sense to make contact with an Astral Beast who will help us.
Jake| What?
Finn| Whee! Haha! Whee! Astral Beast, come to me!
Finn|  Come to me, Astral Beast...
Ice King| I've got lemonade! You want some, Jake?
Ice King| Huh? Gunter...  No, Gunter! No bottles. Look at me.
Gunter| Wenk!
Ice King|  What am I gonna do with you?  You're going to have to wear a leash.  This should keep you out of trouble.  Now, our first bonding activity will be walking in each other's shoes—so to speak. To better understand each other's perspectives, we're going to dress up like each other. Me first!
Ice King|  It's adventure time! I'll save you, Princess! Let's have babies, Princess, and let's teach them to be good babies! Oh, Princess, sure, I'll kiss you. I'm a hero. Hey Finn, don't you think it's weird there's two Finns? Finn?  Not talking? Now, I'm gonna dress like Jake. 
Jake| Noooo! No, no, no, no, no!
Ice King| Okay, okay! We'll bond in another way.
Ice King|" So, I wanted to show you something telling of my soul. I take artful black and white photographs of my penguins' body parts. Photography is art; let's see some art.  Okay, first one. See how Gunter is staring into the camera? He's saying, ""Here I am. Look at me. Accept me."" Okay, second one.  This is a haunting image of a penguin's flipper. Look at how it penetrates the negative space. Oh yes, this one is very—"
Jake| I can't take this any more! Dang it, Finn! What are you doing in there?
Finn| Astral Beast! Where are you? You come here NOW!  Wheee...!
Ice King| ...Yeah, I've thought about it a lot, and having a little gallery show might be nice. A little cheese, a little cider... could be nice, y'know?  Maybe bring a veggie plate? I think people would appreciate that.
Jake|  Key! Gunter. Gunter. Psst! Pssssst. Come here, Gunter. 
Ice King|  This next one is very rewarding...
Jake|  Grab it, Gunter. Pick it up!  Pick it up!!  What are you waiting for? Just grab it!
Gunter| Wenk.  Wenk, wenk. Wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk, wenk.
Jake|  Gunter! Come back.
Ice King| Gunter!
Gunter|  Weeenk.
Ice King|  You are being naughty, Gunter. You've interrupted my thing.  Now you stay right here and go to sleep.  Sleep.  Aw. So cute. Alright, back to art.
Jake|  Gunter. Gunter, wake up.  Go... get... the... key.  Consarn it, Gunter!
Ice King| Okay, time for a break. Who wants lemonade?  Ooh, don't want to lose this.  Gunter! Jake! No! You're bonding without me.
Gunter| Wenk.
Ice King|  It's for your own good, sweetie.  Now then. 
Jake| Wait, you're sleeping up here?!
Ice King| Well...  not before our next bonding activity late-night gab session! Do you want to talk about girls? Do you have a crush on anyone?
Jake| Uh, yeah, my girlfriend? Lady Rainicorn?
Ice King| Ohhhhhh! Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.  Know who I have a crush on?  Princess Bubblegum.
Jake|  You don't say.
Ice King| Oh, I do. I've liked her for quite some time. Feels weird to say it out loud. 
Jake| What?  He fell asleep with his eyes open. Finn! Finn, snap out of it!
Finn| Astral Beast! WHERE ARE YOU? Show yourself! Why not? Does this dance please you, Astral Beast?  Does this please you?!
Finn| THIS IS IIIIT!
Finn|  The Astral Beast cometh.
Ice King|"  Crows like a rooster, laughs] Who's ""hungie""? Jake, you ""hungie""?"
Jake| I'm hungry.
Ice King| Alright, fair enough. Well, how 'bout I make us some omelettes?
Jake| That sounds pretty good, actually.
Ice King| I'm gonna put my foot in it. Eating a part of me will bring us closer together.  I'll be inside of you! 
Jake| Dude, you're back!
Finn| Yup. I just got back from the Astral Plane!
Jake| Where's your Astral Beast?
Finn| It's on its way. It's gonna be awesome.
Jake| What kind of beast?
Finn| Uh, I'm not sure. I couldn't see it in the Astral Plane. But I heard it. It sounded really intense.  Maybe a gorilla?
Jake| A gorilla, huh? 
Finn| Aw, junk! Did I summon butterflies?!  I'm the worst.
Jake| Hey, come on now, you're not the worst.
Finn| Yeah, I am.
Jake| No, you're not! You're the best!
Finn| ...at being the worst.
Finn| What are you doing?
Jake| I'm using my enhanced brain sense to tell your astral beast to slap some sense into you.
Finn| Oh. That's cool. I deserve it.
Jake|  No... you... don't!
Ice King|  Well, I don't want to use too much foot. It'll overpower the eggs. Take away from the omelette.  Huh? Aah!
Ice King| Finn! and Jake! and a bunch of butterflies! and a sword!
Ice King| What do you want from me?
Finn| What do we wa—? We want you to unfreeze us, you lunatic!
Ice King| No! We're not friends yet. You haven't eaten my omelette. 
Finn| Friends don't eat each other, Ice King. That's not how friends work. Now unlock this bottle and unfreeze us.
Ice King| Oh, alright. I don't know how you're doing this, but it is impressive.
Ice King| Wait a minute... which bottle is thi—?  I think they brought me the wrong bottle. Gunter's still upstairs.  Gunter! Gunter! Gunter! Gunter!!
King Of Ooo|  There. Right there. See?
Finn|  Uhhh...Yeah. It's a small thing?
Jake|  Hey, do you have bigger chairs?
King Of Ooo|  Stools.
Jake| Huh?
King Of Ooo|  They're stools; not chairs.
Jake| Well can I have a bigger stool, then?
King Of Ooo| Jake, stop interrupting!
Jake| Sorry.
King Of Ooo| Enhance!
Finn and Jake| Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, whoa!
Jake| Looks like a mushroom. Someone throwing mushrooms?
King Of Ooo| Yes, very good, it is a mushroom! Or a toadstool. That's why you're sitting on stools.
Finn and Jake|  Oh.
King Of Ooo| See, you guys gotta trust me on this one, okay? I picked those stools for a reason. Trust my process! You can get up now.
Jake| My legs.
King Of Ooo| No, nobody's throwing mushrooms.  I believe they're flying on their own. That's where you two come in.
King Of Ooo| Okay, the flying mushroom came from that direction,  so I want you two to head that way until you find one. A big one. and I want you to capture it, and bring it back.
Jake| Why?
King Of Ooo| Huh?
Jake| Why?
King Of Ooo|  Trust my process.
Jake| Okay, but why, though?
Finn| Yeah, we're curious.
King Of Ooo| I wanna ride it around instead of walking. I think people will respect me more.  Hey. Hey, you, what's your name?
Dirt Beer Guy| I'm Dirt Beer Guy.
King Of Ooo| What would you think if you saw me on a giant flying mushroom? Dirt Beer Guy
King Of Ooo| See? Don't fail on this one, boys.  Don't you dare fail me.
Finn|  Actually, I'm kinda glad we're walking in this direction. We never walk in this direction.
Jake|  Hey, how long do you think capturin' a flyin' mushroom takes?
Finn|  Well we gotta find one first. 
Jake| Yeah, that too. How long?
Finn|  Mm. An hour to capture, aaand, if we don't find him by dinner, we'll tell KOO to send out a Banana Guard patrol.
Jake| Tell who?
Finn| KOO.
Jake| ...King Of Ooo?
Finn| Yeah.
Finn| Did you notice he was wearing Princess Bubblegum's clothes?
Jake| Yeah, that was sorta cool. But you know, PB just left her kingdom to 'im. And all her stuff, so what's that about?
Finn| Hmm.
Jake|  I smell mushrooms.
Finn| Yeah, good job, Jake.
Jake| Check it out.  Big enough for KOO's tiny heiny!
Finn| Yeah, the only thing, though, is it's not flying.
Jake| Mmm, yeah... 
Finn| I guess we could just sit here... and wait for it to fly?
Kim Kil Whan|  Okay, so here's what happened. I had sent my top employee, Rennie Hamlin, to check on one of my properties...
Rennie| Okay, boss, I'm here now.
Kim Kil Whan|  ...Joshua and Margaret Investigations!
Rennie| Yep, there's definitely been a break-in.
Kim Kil Whan| Check out the damage. I'll call you back in thirty seconds.
Kim Kil Whan|  Rennie?
Kim Kil Whan| And he's been like this ever since.
Finn| Poor guy.
Kim Kil Whan| Something terrifying has taken residence in Joshua and Margaret's old office, and it's not paying rent. So I want you guys to find out what it is and get it out.
Jake| Yes, sir, son!
Kim Kil Whan| You have one hour! Bye, dad. 
Jake| I wonder what it could be.
Finn| Maybe it's a gross rotting fish gob with long, slimy tentacles.
Jake| Maybe it's a teenage silverware werewolf squatter.
Finn| Hey, you know what it could be? It could be a ghost. I think I saw a ghost there when I was a baby. Maybe it's like a ghost hotspot.
Jake| Ghosts, huh? Whoa, wait! What if it's...
Finn and Jake|  Ghost Mom and Dad!
Finn| I have to brush my hair!
Jake| I'll go get tulips for Mom!
Jake| Man, I've never been this excited about ghosts before.
Finn| This could be one more chance to tell Mom and Dad how much we love them.
Jake| And show 'em that their kids are awesome.
Jake| Hello? Ghosts? If you're in here, please vacate my son's property!
Finn| Unless you're Mom and Dad ghosts!
Jake| Yeah, in that case, I brought flowers!
Finn| Look. There's the broken window. But I don't see any signs of squatters... or ghosts.
Jake|  I'll sniff 'em out. 
Finn| Hey Jake, why don't we own this place?
Jake| I dunno. Kim Kil Whan is a good businessman. Plus I'd feel kinda weird dealing with this stuff.
Finn|" Yeah. Just looking at all this is like, ""Whoa, memories!"" Like this ticker tape machine. Remember when Mom and Dad brought us to work and we made a fort of ticker tape?"
Jake| It was right over there! And over here you gave me a wet willie one time.
Finn| Ew. No I didn't.
Jake| Right. I know you believe that's true, but memories distort over time. Classic false memory syndrome.
Finn| Maybe you're the one with a false memory syndrome.
Jake| Classic false memory syndrome response.
Finn| You hear that? Can you use your dog powers to locate that sound?
Jake|  Way ahead of you, pal. Uh... over there!  Aha! 
Finn| Anything?
Jake| Nope. This is a nice bathroom, though. Man, this whole office is nice. It's kinda bunk how Mom and Dad stopped using it.
Finn| Yeah, it's weird that they had this whole other life, and they just dropped it for us babies.
Jake| We were babies forever.
Finn| Man, we suck.
Jake|  Yeah, but they knew what they were getting into. Whoa! Who moved the sofa? Who put forth those chairs?! Who set the table?! What's going on?!
Finn| This griz is poltergeist biz.
Jake| But I don't want that.
Finn| Embrace the paranormal, bro.  Are these candles real or poltergeist mind-tricks?
Jake| Look!
Finn and Jake|  Poltergeist!
Margaret| Ooh, goody. It's on now, dear.
Joshua| Well done, Margaret, love.
Finn and Jake|  Dad!
Joshua| Hello, future people. I'm Joshua of Joshua and Margaret Investigations, and behind the camera you have my lovely wife and partner, Margaret.
Margaret| Hello.
Joshua| We're making this tape to document the strange phenomena in our new office. Like this weird message spelled out in-  Oh, applesauce.
Margaret| You've really stepped in it now, darling.
Joshua| Indubitably. But something is definitely trying to chat us up, and we're gonna catch it on film. I got this fancy ghost-hunting doohickey. It's supposed to record EVPs and such. 
Margaret| Gracious, there it is!
Joshua| Margaret! Margaret! There's another one over here!
Finn| Dude! This place is full of ghosts! We should split up and see if we can get them to appear.
Jake| I'll take the bathroom!
Finn|" That's the spirit. Hmm. ""Spirit."""
Finn| Maybe Mom and Dad left some books about ghost hunting. Hmm. 
Finn|  A ghost!  It seems like the ticking precedes each ghost encounter. Okay, Finn, what ticks? Metronomes, bombs, pencils...
Jake| The bathroom is a lot scarier than I was expecting.
Finn| ...hearts, egg timers, typewriters.
Finn| What else?  Whoa, lil' ghost babies! Wait, that's baby Jermaine! And baby Jake! And baby me!
Baby Jake| Babababa!
Finn|  Oh yeah?
Baby Jake| Oh! Yip! Yip! Yip! Yip!
Finn|  Oh, snap. I guess it was me. Hold on. These babies ain't ghoulish ghosts at all. They're like time... disto...to...morphs? Hmm.
Jake| Scared? No way! I'm primitive! I'm real! Ghosts, you can't touch this dog! You've got ethereal hands! I'm alive! I'm filled with hot blood! You'll never see through me!  Gotcha, ghoul!
Mole Man| Pardon?
Jake| Aah! Oh, sorry for interrupting your poop.  Hey, sorry again, man, but I have a qu- 
Jake|  I gotta get out of here! No, Jake. You gotta stay for your boy Kim Kil Whan. Ghost! Quit freeloading off my son!  That's a father's job. 
Joshua|  Margaret, stay away!
Jake| Huh? 
Joshua| Something's about to happen!
Jake| Dad?
Finn| So, I can see you, and you can see me. And we're occupying the same space now. So this time stuff must be getting more intense.  Whoa!
Finn| Hey, creeper, stop creepin' on baby Jake!  Baby Jake?
Jake|  Finn! I'm freaking out, man! I just saw the most messed-up thing!
Jake| Dad?
Joshua| Margaret, stay away! Something's about to happen!
Margaret| Something's about to happen with me, too!
Joshua| Margaret! Aah!  Yowzas!
Baby Jake|  Hello, Daddy! Hello, Mommy! It's so nice to be here with you now!
Jake| That's so not how I was birthed! I'm no melon baby! I'm a majestic womb baby!
Finn| Jake, calm down.
Jake| I'm gonna go hog-wild on the next ghost I see!
Rennie| Boy, do I love real estate!
Jake| Aah! 
Kim Kil Whan|  Rennie?
Jake| We're trapped in a ghost trap!
Finn| Relax, bro. There's no ghosts. What we're experiencing are time slips. Point is, something is causing this.
Finn| You ready?
Finn| Time dingalings! Wait, that ticking. I know who this is!  Clock Bear!
Jake| One of the dudes that escaped Dr. Gross' menagerie.
Finn| He must be the one causing the time slips. There's us from before. 
Finn| Are you sick?
Jake| Yeah, I'm pretty disgusted with the whole situation!
Finn| I meant Clock Bear.
Finn|  He's sucking up all the spilled time!
Jake| That doesn't sound scientific!
Finn|  Jake, take care of Clock Bear. There's something I gotta do!
Jake| Wait, I'm still confused! And having feelings!
Joshua| Oh boy, our first case! Looks like we have a poltergeist!  And it's got a little crush on me. What a sassafrass! Gotta get this one tape!  Whoops!
Jake| If this was all time weirdness, I guess that memory was true. I did see my own birth. Far out.  Oh! Must be a leftover time ghost.  Hmm.
Shape-shifter| We have to leave!
Jake| We're doin' what now?
Finn| It was just Clock Bear... No, I don't think he has any money.  Jake? Jake!  Oh, no! Something's happened to Jake! He could be in grave dang-  ...Okay, then.
Finn|  The Goblins have suffered long enough, Xergiok!
Xergiok|  Shush! You guys can't live without me, right? 
Goblins|  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Jake|  You got problems, man.
Xergiok|  Blah! 
Finn|   Wands are for wimps! 
Xergiok|  You may have beaten me this time, but— Ogh!
Finn & Jake|  Haha! Yeah!
Xergiok|  
Finn|  And stay out, Muffin Top!
Goblins|  Finn and Jake! Finn and Jake! Finn and Jake!
Gummy|  Nyaaar! Great job, warriors! You've freed us. I am Gummy, royal goblin chief of staff.
Finn|  Nice to meet you. 
Gummy|  Nyaan! I'm sorry. I have not known a friendly touch in some time. You see, Xergiok loved to be a jerk to us...
Xergiok|  It's spanking time!!! Hiyahhh! Yeah!
Xergiok|   Sigh.  Yahhh!
Goblin|  Ow! Ow!
Goblin|  Ah, heck, Maria, I need to ask you something,  Do you want to do this marriage thing with me?
Goblins|  Awwww!  Isn't that sweet?
Maria|  Oh, my love, the answer is yes.
Xergiok|   Boom! Hahaha!  Congratulations.
Maria|  Oh!!!
Xergiok|  HA HA HA.
Gummy|  We need a good king to rule us, like you mayhaps?
Goblins|  Yeah, yeah! 
Jake|  Yeah, be their king.
Finn|  No, man, I'm an adventurer for life.
Goblin with Cane|  If there isn't a king to not tell me to not start a riot, I could start a riot, then!
Goblin|  No rules, baby! Start that riot!
Goblins|  Whoo! Yeah! 
Goblin|  Flip this table!
Goblin with Hammer|  No one can tell me no!  Aah!
Gummy|  Please, Finn,  we need a king.
Finn|  Stop the riot!
Goblins|  Huh?
Finn|  I'll become your king! To save y'all, from yourselves.
Gummy|   We have a new king!
Goblins|  Woohoo! Yeah!
Goblin|  
Jake|  Finn's gonna need a queen... I'll do it.
Goblins|  
|Outside the Throne Room
Gummy|  Allow me to show you the grounds, Your Majesties.
Jake|  Show me what we got, Gummy. Show it to me!  Dude! I'm psyched!
Finn|  Hahaha, yeah!
Gummy|  The Goblin Birthing Pits, Your Majesties.
Goblin in the Pit|  I'm being... born.
Finn|  That's pretty neat.
Gummy|  The Garden of Living Fountains.
Finn & Jake|  Whoo! Awesome.
Gummy|  The Royal Game Archive, complete with controller hats.
Finn & Jake|   Ooooh.
Gummy|  The Royal Dragon Stables.
Finn|   Whoa!
Gummy|  And finally, the royal bedroom, with king-sized bed for the royal couple.
Jake|  Can you make that a bunk bed?
Gummy|  Yes, my queen. Whisper Dan. 
Whisper Dan|  
Jake|  I call top. 
Finn|  And I call...
Gummy|  Wait! For you, great king, the Book of Royal Rules. 
Finn|  Hmmm. Sounds boring.
Gummy|  Oh, no worries, my Liege. I'll read it to you.
Finn|  Hey, Jake, want to stay awake and hear some rules?
Jake|  
Finn|  Alright, lay it on me, Gummy.
Gummy|  Introduction, colon, the 623 royal rules were established in moon year 16, in response to Elder Gorflox's repeated requests for an organized...  Awaken, Your Highness!
Jake|  No way, dude. 
Gummy|  Your Excellency! Let's go. We have much to do! 
Finn|  Whoo!!
Gummy|   This is where you may perform your daily processes, my king 
Finn|  Whoooaa!!!! Look at that huge mirror... and it's painted baby blue—boy style.
Gummy|"  Come, sire, it is time to brush your teeth in the front of the ""boy style"" mirror. "
Finn|  Whooo!!! Awesome! 
Goblins around the sink|   Oh, no, no, no, Your Majesty! Let us brush your teeth
Finn|   Yaaaah!! Whoa, ease up, dudes. Finn access only.
One goblin around the sink|  Aaaah, he's a rule breaker! Don't spank us too hard. 
Gummy|  Spare them, Your Majesty! Spank me instead!  Set my buttocks ablaze!
Finn|  Guys, what are you talking about?
Gummy|  Rule 1 The king shall not brush his own teeth... in the book of royal rules I read to you last night.
Finn|  Oh! Oh. Guys, put your hams away.
All three goblins|  Whaa??
Finn|  I'm not gonna spank your hams. I'm not that kind of king!
Gummy|  So then... we may brush your teeth, my lord?
Finn|  You can brush my teeth... I guess.
All 3 goblins|  Yaayyyy!!!!!! 
Finn|  This brunch looks great! Can't wait to dig in. 
Gummy|  Uhhh, I will cut that, Your Highness.
Finn|  Gummy, as king, I order you to let me cut it.
Gummy|  I'm sorry, sire. The royal rules don't allow it.
Finn|  I'm cutting it, Gummy! 
Gummy|  No! 
Finn|   Thank you, Gummy.
Gummy|  Uhhhhh, a thousand pardons, my lord. You're not going to chew that, are you?
Finn|  Yeah.
Gummy|  I'm sorry, sire. The royal rules don't allow it.
Finn|  Gummy, just let me do this. No one will know.
Gummy|  I would know. 
Finn|  Uhhhhhh, Jake, this is nuts.
Jake|  Maybe, but rules are rules. 
Gummy|  Master, eat your food. I chewed thoroughly and heated it to goblin body temperature.
Finn|  I'm not hungry, Gummy.
Gummy|  You look a little bit down. Would you like me to weep for you?
Finn|  No, Gummy. It's just.... 
Goblin|  Sire, sire!!!! There's trouble in town square. A thief!!
Finn|  A thief? Hahaha, yes! I'll handle it! 
Gummy|  No, sire! The king is not allowed to fight. He must give a speech to the thief. That is the royal rule, my Liege.  There's the thief! 
Thief|  Give me them hot buns, lady!
Finn|  Hey, thief!
A goblin|  It's the new king. It's him! 
Finn|  I got a speech for you—
Gummy|  Nooooooo!  The Royal Speaker must give the speech.
Finn|  What.
Gummy|  Ya see? 
Royal Speech-taker|   Since the dawn of time, the balance of what is right and what is wrong has...
Thief|   Ha ha ha, I'll take this.
Gummy|  Yes, you can feel it slowly working, eh?
Finn|   I can't let this go on.  Hands off, thief!!
Thief|  
Finn|  Ha!! Here you go, old lady. 
Old lady|  Oh, no, the new king! Just as cruel as the last king.
Finn|  I—you—what?
Another goblin|  Oh, king, we beg you not to slay the old lady.  Aaaah!!! 
Finn|  No, wait.
Old lady|  Don't slay me! You may keep the hot buns, Your Majesty! 
Another goblin|  I'm ready for my spanking, Mr. Xergiok part two.
Rest of group|  We're ready  for our spankings, sire.
Finn|   ♪I just want to help y'all as much as I can, and y'all just keep showing me your goblin hams.  When I became king, I didn't think y'all would show me your rears, but I'll accept my boring fate, and shed this tear...  'cause I can't seem to cure you of your groundless fears.♪
Gummy|  No. No more spankings...  Aaaahh!!!!
Finn|  Gummy, don't be afraid. I'm gonna stick to the rules now, okay?
Gummy|  My lord, I'm sorry, y-you haven't heard? Xergiok is returning with an evil army. Come look through the scope!  You see? 
Xergiok|  Prepare to destroy them all!
Gummy|   Ohhh...
Finn|   If I defeat Xergiok as king, I can prove to the goblins that an active king can be a good king, but I can't let them know until it's all over. Stay fainted, Gummy.  Ooooooooh! Whisper Dan, have you seen Jake?
Whisper Dan|  
Jake|  I'm in here.
Finn|  Xergiok's back with an army of Earclopses. Let's bust them up.
Jake|  pbbbbbbbbbbbbb. All right, man, how do we do this?
Finn|  Hmmmmmmm. 
Jake|  What if they figure it out?
Finn|  No way, man.
Gummy|  I'm going to be honest with you, king Finn. When I'm scared, I feel most safe in your lap.
Xergiok|  Line up for you spankings, goblins! 
One goblin|  Ohhhhh, too late—in my pants.
Finn|  Jake, the goblins can't see me being unkingly. I need a disguise.
Jake|  Jump in my mouth. 
Xergiok|  Who among you has the courage to face Xergiok?
Finn|  Shut your kissin' hole, Xergiok! It's time for a beatin'.
Xergiok|  I salute you, foolish warrior! You can be my personal sla—
Finn|   wowowowowowowowowoowowoow! 
Xergiok|  How in the world? 
Xergiok|   Eat this!  Whoa!  Ha ha, you missed me— 
Goblins|   
Gummy|  Oh, great king, with the help of a brave soldier, you thwarted the evil Xergiok. 
Goblins|  Hurrah!!! 
Finn|  C'mon, dude, lets get out of here.
Jake|   Alright. 
Finn|  Well, looks like they got the king they wanted, buddy.
Jake|  Yep.
Finn|  And we're going home to adventure.
Jake|  Mmhmm.
Finn|  High five us, dude.  Hey, Jake?
Jake|  Wha?
Finn|  Why do the insides of you smell like vanilla?
Jake|  Ohh, uh, a wizard put a curse on me.
Finn|  Huh, neat.
Finn|  Birthday boy-e-e-e!
Princess Bubblegum|  Enjoying your party?
Finn|  It's great having fun with all my friends. Well, some of my friends mostly Banana Guards.
Princess Bubblegum|  Yeah, sorry about that. The Candy Kingdom is in full lockdown until I can sort out the rumors about my Uncle Gumbald. He's been gone for years, but we should stay vigilant.
Finn|  Don't worry, PB. Now that I'm 17, I'm feelin' ready for anything. Feels like I'm really hitting my stride, y'know?
Marceline|  Finn, I want to give you your gift before I forget. It's a harmonica.
Finn|  Awesome! 
BMO|  Finn, I designed an exciting new game for you.
Finn|  Show me.
BMO|"  It's called ""Birthday Boyfighter. "
Finn|  Looks like another hit.
Starchy|  Finn, Starchy didn't get you squat.
Huntress Wizard|  I got you a present too. It has emotional and metaphorical significance.
Finn|  It's beautifully wrapped. Wonder what it is.
Huntress Wizard|  It's an elk's heart.
Finn|  Oh, cool. I don't have one of those.
Finn|  What's that sound?
Starchy|  It's zombies.
Huntress Wizard|  Sounds like hooves.
Starchy|  Zombie cows.
Finn|  You're green!
 Green Knight|  I'm the Green Knight! And before you ask, yes, of course, I brought you a birthday present. It's a battle axe.
Finn|  That's some axe. Am I an axe guy though? I've always thought of myself as a sword guy.
Green Knight|  But only if you play me a game for it.
Finn|  What's the game?
Green Knight|"  Oh, this game is called ""All you have to do is strike me with it, and it is yours."""
Finn|  Mm?  I can't axe some stranger. Wait a minute! Where's Jake? I know what's going on.
Princess Bubblegum|  No, I don't think you do.
Finn|  Relax, Princess. Jake loves playing birthday pranks on me.
unidentifiable Banana Guard|  Yes, of course One of Jake's classic pranks.
Finn|  Okay, I'm in.
Green Knight|  May your aim be steady.
Finn|   Sure thing Jake!  I win!
Everyone|  
Banana Guards|  Yeah, Finn! Yeah, Finn!
Jake|  Happy birthday, Finn.
Finn|   Jake! When did you Whose head did I Are you pranking me?
Jake|  What? No. My prank is this fake-out gift. Huh?
Jake|  What's this guy's deal?
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, nuh-uh! Banana guards, surround him! And be on the lookout for anything else strange!
Banana Guards|  Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup! Surrender, please.
Unidentifiable Banana Guard|  Princess, is that strange?
Princess Bubblegum|  Yes!
Unidentifiable Banana Guard|  I did good.
Banana Guards|  
Princess Bubblegum|  My guards!
Finn|  I got this. Raah!  Eel!
Marceline|   Get him!
Jake|    Aw.
Huntress Wizard|  He might have an invisible shield. But I'm not sure, because it's invisible.
Jake|  Owiee. Yes. It's an invisible shield.
Princess Bubblegum|  An invisible shield. I've got a device for the dissolution of invisible shields.
Princess Bubblegum|  Impossible.
Green Knight|   Heh!
Princess Bubblegum|  Back off, everyone. He's using some advanced mystery tech.
Green Knight|  
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, let's talk.
Green Knight|   What do you want to talk about?
Princess Bubblegum|  Where did you come from? Why are you playing this weird game with Finn?
Green Knight|   
Princess Bubblegum|  He's playing Mr. Laughing Silent Guy.
Finn|  Game's over, bro.
Green Knight|  The game isn't over until I strike you.
Finn|  Hmm. Let's come up with a better way to settle this, like reasonable late teens.
Green Knight|  I'm listening.
Finn|  Well, we've got everything set up for party games. How about if I beat you two out of three, you got to answer our questions.
Princess Bubblegum|  Psst! Nuh!
Green Knight|  And if I win chop, chop.
Finn|  Deal.
Princess Bubblegum|  Wait, Finn, I think he's plotting something.
Finn|  I-It's fine. I'm 17. I'm hittin' my stride.
Finn|  Hey, Green Knight, why are they all mimey?
Green Knight|  Ah, just to keep things fair.
Princess Bubblegum|  I don't think he can hear us.
Green Knight|  
Finn|  Okay, guy. Why don't we start with something basic like balls and coconuts. Hup! Hup! Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup, hup. Ba-ba-ba-boom! Boom!
Everyone|   Okay, Finn! Yeah, yeah! You got it, Finn! You go, boy!
Finn|   Boooooooom!   Aw, what? I'll let you have that one, 'cause I'm a big boy today. But let's see you try and beat four out of five, huh?
Green Knight|  How do you like them coconuts?
Finn|   I hate them coconuts.
Princess Bubblegum|   Something's wrong.
Marceline|  Yeah, I swear that looked fake.
Huntress Wizard|  It was. I saw it all with my Huntress vision. Finn is totally getting played.
Finn|   All right. You got a freaky curveball, man. But can you climb a greasy pole?
Starchy|  A greasy pole?! It's hard enough climbing a non-greasy pole!
Finn|  Ready?
Green Knight|   Mm-hmm!
Finn|  One, two, three, go!  Ha, ha! 
Finn|  Huh?
Green Knight|  Finn, you climb so good. I guess you win this round.
Princess Bubblegum|  Hmm.
BMO|  Yay, Finn!
Marceline, Huntress Wizard, BMO And Starchy|  Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Jake|  That's right! Yay, yay! Now's our chance, BMO.
BMO|  I-Is Finn gonna be okay?
Jake|  He's got this. He's 17.
Finn|  Who's the ma-a-an? Who's the 17-year-old ma-a-a-an?  Hoo! You've been a good sport, so I'll let you choose the tiebreaker.
Bubblegum, Marceline, Starchy and Huntress Wizard|   Don't do it! Wait, don't do it! Not a good idea!
Green Knight|  Very well. Hmm How about a game of some good old-fashioned arm wrestling?
Finn|  Arm wrestling, huh? I see what you did there. My guns are obviously weak as heck from climbing that greasy pole. If only I had some kind of  superhuman robot arm. Bam!
Green Knight and Finn at same time|  Three, two, one, go!
Finn|   Ahh!
Green Knight|  You can't tell from my face, but I am smiling triumphantly.
Finn|  Nooo! It's my birthday!
Green Knight|  I know. It's my birthday, too.
Finn|  Fern?
Bubblegum, Marceline, Starchy and Huntress Wizard|  Oh, no! No! Finn!
Green Knight|   Finally, I win! 
Gumbald|  Fern! We've seen enough.
Finn|  
Bubblegum, Marceline, Starchy and Huntress Wizard|  Finn! Finn! Finn, are you all right?
Starchy|  I love you, Finn!
Huntress Wizard|  Quick, eat this elk's heart.
Princess Bubblegum|  What is this?
Gumbald|  It's a family reunion.
Princess Bubblegum|  Uncle Gumbald, Cousin Chicle, Aunt Lolly. How are you back?!
Gumbald|"  Here's a hint  ""Oh, my glob""."
Princess Bubblegum|  Lumpy Space Princess. ] miniseries where LSP reverts Ooo back to normal] When she reset Ooo, she reset you.
Gumbald|  For 800 years, you kept us imprisoned, Princezzin.
Princess Bubblegum|  No, you were happier as candy people.
Gumbald|  We thought we were. But don't worry it's your turn to be happy now. Get juiced.
Marceline|   Back off, gumwad!
Gumbald|  The vampire girl is legitimately scary. Very well. You've witnessed our superior technology and watched your champion crushed.
Finn|  
Gumbald|  We'll go for now.
Green Knight|  
Finn|  This is my worst B-day ever.
Everyone|   Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you
Ice King|   Happy birthday Mr.Finn Mert-ens
Everyone|   Happy birthday to you.
Jake| Hmm.  'Make more friends with sing-talking.' ♪ ♪ Hey there, Finn! Whatcha reading? ♪ ♪
Finn|" It's a manuscript about ""The Legend of Dead Mountain."" Supposedly, if you get to the top, there's a treasure that will change you into the person you always wanted to be."
Jake| Ha, that's a dumb story; I love dumb stories! What would you change about yourself if you got that treasure? Fix your weird cursed grass arm so it wouldn't be weird and cursed?
Finn| Nah. I'd like to be taller.
Jake| How tall we talking about?
Finn| I don't know. Like, couple of inches. Say...tall as Princess Bubblegum?
Jake|  Oh, I see.
Finn| Jake, how would you change yourself on Dead Mountain if only the legends were true?
Jake|  I wouldn't change anything; I'm the whole package.  Whoa!
Finn|  Hey! There's a big warning about Dead Mountain in here. See?  It says some kind of evil hermit guards the mountaintop.  'Don't let him look at you or something horrible will happen.' That seals the deal. The twin temptations of getting to grow a couple of inches and battling an evil hermit sound like a pretty perfect day. Let's go!
Turtle Princess| Shh!
Finn|  Let's go.
Finn and Jake|  Gear up for battle! You smell like cattle! Gear up for battle! You smell... Like cattle!
Finn| Monsters that get you by looking at you are so doomb.
Jake| Everybody knows all you need is a mirror.
Finn| They ought to get a new gimmick.  There's the evil hermit's uh... what is that? A hut?
Jake| No, it's a yurt.
Finn and Jake| Yah! Rats!
Finn|  Is that the hermit?  We don't get to fight the hermit.
Jake| Hey look.
Finn| What is it, boy?
Jake| The treasure. Okay, here it goes.  Oh great treasure, make my taste buds think they're tasting fried chicken even when I eat my fruits and vegetables. I don't have any fruits or vegetables on me. I guess I'll find out later if that worked. Your turn.
Finn|  Oh great treasure, I want to be approximately 11.5 inches taller.  Gross! It's leaking! 
Jake| This place is depressing.
Finn| And I'm not growing taller. There's nothing going on here. ON TOP OF DEAD MOUNTAIN!
Jake| We should have known better than to trust a book.
Finn| Yeah. He makes one cool skeleton, though.  These shades...  Let me check out these shades.  Aah! Ohh!
Jake| Finn!
Finn| Huh? Jake?
Jake| You're awake! Oh, I was so worried. I've been waiting with a bowl of soup. It has hoops and loops and maybe some goop.
Finn|  What happened? I don't remember getting into bed.
Jake| Don't worry. You're gonna be fine...  in no time.
Finn| Thanks for taking care of me. You're the greatest big brother ever.  W-Why are you doing that?
Jake| I'm not.
BMO| You're awake! You want some tea? Or saltine crackers?
Finn| BMO, you're my little angel.
BMO| I'm a real boy!  With wings!  And a halo!  Oh!
Finn| What's happening?
Jake| I don't know but it probably has something to do with your weird old eyes.
Finn|  Something is wrong with my eyes?
Finn| Aah! Hermit eyes! Dead-hermit eyes!
Jake| Heh, it's fine.
Finn| Do you think the hermit did this... to punish me for grabbing his shades?
Jake| I think maybe the eyes are the treasure.
Finn| So, then, am I making people what they want to be?
Jake| No, because I don't want to be this awesome sweater bro. But maybe that's how you see me.
Shelby| Hey dudes. Nice eyes, Finn. What's the word? What's the haps?  What's your major?
Jake| Whoa! Do you see Shelby as a bookish nerd?
Shelby| You're a nerd.
Finn| I don't know, maybe. Is that bad?
Finn| Hello? ... Hiya, P.B. What's up? ... You need help with your speech? ... An emergency?! ... On our way.  Let's roll, varsity Jake.
Jake| Ah ah. Before we go...  Until you figure out how to use them, keep those peepers covered.
Princess Bubblegum|  What to wear for my speech...  Boss next door or hot president?
Finn| Is this what you needed help with?
Princess Bubblegum| No, I think I got this. Oh! Hi Finn and Jake. You guys look...cool. You trying out a new look?  Anyways, I'm preparing for a very important speech about the benefits of candying vegetables, and I need you guys to take care o-o-o-o-o-of  that.
Finn| Help Starchy set up chairs?
Princess Bubblegum| No no no. That.
Finn| Oh boy. We're on it, princess.
Princess Bubblegum| It's probably nothing. He's been good lately, but it's a big speech, you know.
Ice King|  Ohh. Ah.
Finn and Jake| Hey Ice King!
Ice King| Aah! I'm not doing anything wrong. I was just lady-watching.  Ow!
Finn| Oh no.
Ice King| Where'd my muscles go?! I'm a scrawny-armed loser! 
Jake| That's how you see him? That's beautiful.
Finn| Sure, I-I mean it's... It's hard not to sometimes. Where'd those glasses go?
Jake| There.
Finn| Starchy! Give those back, you thief!
Starchy|  Huh? No way! Starchy looks good!
Finn| Starchy, you butt!
Starchy|  Ohh!
Finn| Oof, sorry.
Princess Bubblegum| What's going on here?  Can you explain this?
Finn| I don't know. I'm not a psychiatrist!
Jake| Come on, let's get you home, dude. Peebs, good luck with the speech.
Princess Bubblegum| But... Teen boy heartthrob it is.
Jake| Okay, at least now we're safe from you donking up any more of our friends.
Finn| Nobody got hurt.
Neptr| Have any of you guys seen BMO?
Finn| Aah! Did I kill Neptr?!
Jake| You turned him into a microwave. So...yeah, you kind of did.
Finn| But... but... but... That's not how I see Neptr, is it? I like Neptr. He's like my half-son. If I was a better person, would I be turning my friends into better things? Am I uncaring, judgmental...
Jake| Uh, Finn.
Finn| Self-centered? Monstrous? I'm... I'm... I'm a huge wa-a-a-a-a-d! 
Jake| Finn! You're being melodramatic!
Finn| I know it's you.
Jake| Hey, buddy. I figured you'd come back here.
Finn| Don't look at me, Jake. I might turn you into a microwave.
Jake|" Baloney! You turned Neptr into a microwave because he's a microwave. But that doesn't mean that's all he is to you. I know you think Neptr is an interesting person, and I know that ""microwave"" is just one part of his personality. I mean...maybe your eyes are just bad at describing things, you know? Like how you feel about people, what they mean to you... That stuff's in your guts. Eyes can't grok that... Unless you have the eyes of like a trained artist or something. But you don't. I'm telling you, man you're not a bad dude like this skeleton bro, or you'd be turning everyone into rats and plops. Now come on. Look at me."
Finn| Jake, you're so wise.
Jake| What?! Di- Wha... Well, at least you're listening to me. And wise old Jakey got a plan.  P.B., you want to go first?
Princess Bubblegum| He may not be the most cunning soldier, but one thing about Finn is that he always puts other people first, and that makes him a true hero.
Starchy| Finn helped Starchy fart once.
Shelby| What a life saver.
Ice King| Finn's a mean old party pooper.  Ow! But he is the hottest guy in Ooo, so he can kind of do what he wants.
Jake| Finn's just the best guy to do bro stuff with, like lying on the grass and talking to bugs or baking chocolate chip cookies. Finn's just a good friend.
Finn| I'm me again. These balls are going nuts.  Uh... My son.
Neptr| Eye pie!
Everyone| Ew.
Finn| Good job, Neptr. You saved the day.  Neptr! Neptr!
Everyone| Neptr! Neptr! Neptr! Neptr! Yay!
BMO| I just had the most wonderful dream.
Jake| If I hear another peep, there's gonna be trouble! Final warning. Okay, go ahead, BMO.
Jake| Okay, welcome back to the program. We're talkin' with our special guest, Finn the Human.
Finn| Hello.
Jake| Now, Finn, before the break, you were sayin' somethin' interesting—that you're gettin' outta the romance biz. So, what happened?
Finn| Well, I don't want to bore your listeners...
Finn| But let's just say the time has come to stop dating princesses... and return to savin' 'em.
Jake| And you're not just sayin' that to, uh—  make yourself seem more attractive?
Finn| Yeah, of course. No games goin' on here.
Jake| Hold on, hold on.  What's that noise?
BMO| I think someone's knocking at the door.
Jake| Can you see who it is?
BMO| Yes, Jake.
Jake| So, it's goin' pretty good, huh?
Finn|" Yeah, but maybe we should stop talking about this ""love"" junk and get back to adventuring."
Slime Princess| Finn! Jake! I need your help; it's an emergency! 
Finn| Now we're talkin'! Don't cry, Slime Princess. We're at your service.
Slime Princess| I need Finn to marry me.
Finn| I'm sorry, SP, but I've given up the dating scene.
Slime Princess| You don't understand. If I don't get a husband, I'll lose my kingdom.
Ice King|  I'll do it!
Jake| What did I tell you?!
Slime Princess| Please let me explain.
Slime Princess| Recently, my much hotter younger sister, Blargetha, married a Slime rogue named Guillermo. As a result, Elder Plops decreed that if I was not married by tomorrow, rule of the Slime Kingdom would pass to my sister...
Slime Princess| ...which I'd be, like, totally fine with...
Slime Princess| Except, I recently discovered they are both evil. Evil to the core! They plan to militarize the kingdom and begin a campaign of aggressive conquest,  sacking our neighboring kingdoms,  stealing their resources,  and eventually taking over the entire world! 
Jake| Ew.
Slime Princess| Finn, this will happen unless someone marries me.
Finn| No.
Ice King|  Psst! 
Jake| Hmm!
Slime Princess| Please, Finn. I know I've crushed on you in the past, but I have no intention of locking this down. Our marriage will be in name only.
Finn| Hmmm...
Jake|  Wait, I'm coming, too! I'm gonna eat popcorn and make hilarious jokes.  Aw, who ate all my popcorn?
Ice King|  You call this a room? There's not even a window. Oh, wait. Are we rolling?
Jake|  How much farther? This popcorn's not gonna last all day.  Alright, now it might.
Slime Princess| We're here.  Welcome to my little oasis in the wasteland.
Jake|" Oasis? More like, ""No way, sis!"" "
Finn| Huh?
Jake|  
Finn| Whoa! This is amazing! You okay, buddy?
Jake|" You could say I got out of there  in the ""lick"" of time. Zing!"
Slime Princess| Quickly. We're already late.  This is the most important place in the kingdom.
Finn| The royal palace?
Slime Princess| No, it's where me and all my main splurts hang out. Hi, girls!
Slime People| Hi!
Finn| Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig, what are you doing here?
Tree Trunks| Oh, we always come here when we want to shake it, Finn. It's the only triple cray-rated disco in all of Ooo.
Slime Princess| Get your face pretty, Finn. My people are already assembled in the courtyard.   Greetings, loyal slimejects!
Slime Princess| I would like to introduce my new husband,  Finn the Human!
Slime Princess|  What did I tell you? Piece of cake.
Blargetha| Attention, my loyal slimejects!
Slime Princess|  It's Blargetha.  And that's the mysterious Guillermo. He hails from a faraway, much more somber Slime Kingdom where people have strange customs and no love in their eyes. Their discos aren't even rated one cray.
Blargetha| My husband would like to say something. And, uh, he would, too, if not for his extremely sore throat. So I will say it for him. We challenge you to the Trials of Glarb.
Slime Princess| I object! Ancient traditions such as the Trials of Glarb are no longer relevant in our modern self-indulgent society.
Elder Plops|  Order, order! I demand order. I, Elder Plops, being the coolest guy in the room, will settle this dispute. The matter will be settled on the battleground...
Finn| Alright!
Elder Plops| ...the battleground of love.
Finn| Aw.
Elder Plops| The couple that I deem most truly in love shall rule the Slime Kingdom for life.  Plops out. 
Jake| This is, like, the opposite of what you wanted.
Elder Plops| Welcome to the Trials of Glarb, hosted by me, Elder Plops. The first trial will be Crooning. You guys are gonna get into these sweet boats I made and croon for each other on the lake. The most loving and heartfelt song, judged by me, Elder Plops, will win.
Elder Plops| I really want to hear some emotional song work here. The people want to hear emotional stuff. So let's see some stuff, alright? 
Slime Princess| Okay, Finn, you can do it.
Finn| I don't know. I'm still jacked up over my lady biz.
Slime Princess| Well, just lose yourself in your own mind and go numb. Then let it all out.
Finn| Eh.  Okay. Just let it all out.  Why can't I get over you?
Elder Plops| Finn, way to go. I could tell the people were really impressed. Guillermo, you're up.
Blargetha| Hmm? Okay, Guillermo. I'll ask, I'll ask. Uh, Guillermo still has a sore throat! Uh, may I sing on, uh, his behalf?
Elder Plops| Elder Plops thinks that's okay.
Blargetha|"   ♪I want to touch your hand with my hand. I want to rub your cheek with my cheek. Maybe later we can get ""Do not disturb.""♪ I'm done!"
Elder Plops| As Elder Plops, I have heard many songs in my life, and I can only say this... Finn, you win this one.
Slime People| Hooray!
Finn| Whoo!
Slime Princess| Yes!
Elder Plops| Welcome, everyone, to our second trial...  Spooning. When I say go, the big spoon will put his arm around the little spoon and cuddle. I will be watching you spoon, measuring and assessing your love by posture and overall vibe. The best cuddle, or spoon, wins.
Finn| Wait, what?!
Elder Plops| Spooners, get in your futons.
Finn| Uh, I don't feel good about this.
Elder Plops| Ready, set...
Elder Plops| Spoon!
Finn|  No, wait. I don't wanna do this.
Slime Princess| Wrap those gorgeous pythons around me!
Finn| No! This feels weird!
Slime Princess| Come on, Finn, they're crushing us!
Blargetha|  Huh! Huh! Huh!
Elder Plops| Blargetha and Guillermo, very nice.
Finn| Nooooooooooooooooo!
Elder Plops| Yeesh. Alright, everyone, stop. I've seen enough. Blargetha and Guillermo's love was way-off-the-charts good. They win.
Blargetha| Yes! I love you, baby. You spoon so good!
Slime Princess| No!
Elder Plops| The score is tied. There's one more trial after Spooning and Crooning Smooching. I'm sorry it doesn't rhyme with Crooning and Spooning. We will begin our next trial on the morrow!
Slime Princess|  This is not going well.
Finn| I'm sorry, Slime Princess. I'm just gonna mess this next trial up.
Slime Princess| Is it because you haven't done much kissing? You don't have to be embarrassed by your innocence.
Finn| Pretending to be in love is making me sad. It makes me think about Flame Princess.
Slime Princess| What If I pretend to be your ex?
Finn| That's worse, I think.
Slime Princess| Well, it looks like I'm losing my kingdom to the forces of evil.
Finn|  No, Slime Princess. Let's practice this smooch. 
Slime Princess|  Mmmm.
Finn|   I'm sorry. I—I can't!   Bunk this.
Slime Princess| Wait! Where are you going?
Finn| I'm going to punch Guillermo in his stupid face until he agrees to leave the kingdom.
Slime Princess| I want to come!
Finn| Hey, Guillermo! Can you come out here for a... quick meeting?
Jake| More like a quick beating! Hey-oh!
Blargetha|" He says ""Eat a fat dollop and buzz off!"""
Slime Princess| Blargetha!
Finn|  Hyup!  Hmm. 
Blargetha| Finn, you shouldn't break in to a woman's room.
Finn| Hyah! Everyone okay?
Jake|" Yes. ""Tank"" you."
Finn| Huah! 
Blargetha| Huh?
Finn| Guillermo!  Hyuh!  Are you dead, man? Aw, jeez, bro.  Huh? These are olives.
Blargetha| Uh-oh.
Slime Princess| Blargetha, why would you make a fake husband? You're so hot.
Blargetha| You don't know how hard it is to be this hot. Women don't want to talk to you, because they're intimidated, and guys don't want to talk to you, because they're too scared. You're alone in the hottest, most sexiest prison. So I stuck some olives in a glob of gelatin and called it my lover.
Finn| Well, I'm sorry, Blargetha, but you're going to have to spend more time in your metaphorical prison in a real prison 'cause what you're doing is illegal.
Slime Princess| Uh, no, it just disqualifies her from challenging me.
Finn| Whoops.
Elder Plops| By the authority of Elder Plops,  I officially declare...  you are still the Slime princess.
Slime People|  Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Slime Princess| Finn, what do you think?
Finn| I don't want to disappoint all these people.
Slime Princess| I'm sorry! I can't do it! 
BMO| One free-range Humpty Dumpty.
BMO| Sorry.
BMO| Fine aged cheddar man.
BMO| Homemade ketchup.
BMO| A fresh pepper fart
BMO| Dance, parsley.
BMO| Face bread.
BMO| Special sentient sandwich.
Jake| Mmm... Is that special sentient sammich?
BMO| Bingo.
BMO| Made by the BMO.
Jake| BMO, you're my little cherub.
Jake| You know that?
Jake| You made all this for me, right?
Jake| Aaahhh.
BMO| Not so fast, Jake!
Jake| Naaaw.
BMO| The sammiches are yours...
BMO| For a price.
Jake| What?
BMO| I need you to be my tiny horse for the day, so I can do my live-action cowboy role-play adventure.
Jake| No way.
Jake| Poo deal.
Jake| I'll do 20 minutes.
BMO| It took me over six hours to prepare this nosh, Jake!
BMO|" Not to mention the time it took acquiring the ingredients through the ""special market,"" putting my safety and my reputation on the line."
Jake| Okay, fine, fine.
Jake| Three sammiches for every hour I'm a horse.
BMO| Mm...
BMO| One sammich per horse-hour, six-hour minimum.
Jake| Deal.
BMO| Yippee-ki-yay!
Jake| Om!
Jake| Mm.
Jake| Oh, yeah.
Jake| It tastes alive.
BMO| Steed yourself, partner.
Jake| Okay.
Jake| Om.
Jake| 'Kay.
BMO| Oh, come on, man.
BMO| You didn't even try.
Jake| I did try.
Jake| Horses are hard.
Jake| How's that?
BMO| Eh, it reads.
BMO| Steady, girl.
Jake| Wha...
BMO| Shh, shh, shh.
BMO| I'm going to mount you now.
BMO| Hup!
BMO| Good girl.
Jake| So, what's the plan anyway, BMO?
BMO| The plan is to punch the toads to the stump and bring justice to the peeps!
Jake| Ow.
BMO| Oh, and by the way, Jake, from now on, you can call me... Angel Face.
BMO| Hyah!
Jake| Yow!
BMO| I used to be a guy who ran from Glob with the wind at my back and the devil on my shoulder.
BMO| Now I'm the guy chasing those guys, yet the devil is still here, sleeping in my couch.
Jake| BMO, that hurt when you dug your boots into my side belly.
Jake| Are you gonna apologize or...
BMO| Horses do not talk.
BMO| Over there! Hyah!
BMO| Whoa!
BMO| Jackrabbit Johnson.
BMO| This guy's wanted for stealing piglets from their mothers while they are feeding.
BMO| Makes me sick.
BMO| He was last seen in dead goat gulch.
BMO| What do you say, girl?
BMO| Want to catch this donkey and split the reward?
Jake| You have 45 minutes left before my next sammich.
BMO| Time's a-wasting!
Jake| Hyee!
BMO| Hmm.
Jake| BMO, I'm tired.
BMO| Looks like my horse needs a rest.
BMO| Slow down, horse.
BMO| ♪ Being a robot cowboy ♪
BMO| ♪ Is a lonely job ♪
BMO| ♪ But somebody has to protect the piglets ♪
BMO| ♪ I got nobody but my horse ♪
BMO| ♪ And my friend the cactus guy ♪
BMO| ♪ It's okay because I like them a lot ♪
BMO| ♪ That's okay, I like being a robot ♪
BMO| ♪ Cowboy ♪
BMO| Be careful, Jake.
BMO| This is where Jackrabbit Johnson's gang of lowlife bandits lays low.
BMO| Hyah!
BMO| Bang! Bang!
BMO| Put them up, partner!
BMO| Hyah!
BMO| Pyew, pyew!
BMO| Pyew, pyew, pyew!
BMO| I want answers!
BMO|  You can't do this to us!
BMO| No answers, eh?
BMO| No use to me!
BMO| How about you, frisco?
BMO|  I'm not going to talk.
BMO| Why am I talking to you then?!
BMO| Hooah!
BMO| Yah! Unh!
Neptr| BMO, what did you do?
BMO| It's Jackrabbit Johnson's right-hand man, Tumbleweed Terk.
Neptr| I spent the last three months building all of this.
Jake| Oh, that's where you been?
Neptr| Mm-hmm.
Neptr| BMO gave me a Finn Cake.
BMO| Don't talk to my horse, Tumbleweed.
Neptr| Aah.
BMO| Where is Jackrabbit Johnson?!
BMO| I know you know where he's headed.
Neptr| I don't know!
Neptr| Tumbleweed terk's always the last to know.
Neptr| It's just like I told the other bounty hunter, I swear.
BMO| I don't believe a word you say.
BMO| Now take a message to your compadre.
BMO| Tell him his pal, Angel Face, is itching to get together.
BMO| Tell Jackrabbit Johnson to meet me at Dirtwater Flats, just like the old days!
Neptr| Okay.
BMO| Sock citizens of dead goat gulch, we can rebuild!
Jake| Neigh!
Me-Mow| Grrr.
BMO| Uhh...
BMO| I don't remember where Dirtwater Flat is.
BMO| Better stop for the night.
BMO| We can make a campfire here.
BMO| And we will talk about what we will do with the reward money.
Jake| No.
Jake| It's been fun, BMO, but it's time to go home because there are no more sandwiches.
BMO| But I want to finish the adventure.
Jake| Which direction is the house?
BMO| I'm not sure.
BMO| Get down!
Me-Mow| Getting kicked out of the guild of assassins... check.
Me-Mow| Capturing my first bounty...
Me-Mow| Check.
Me-Mow| Going to Finn and Jake's treehouse and getting revenge...
Me-Mow| Unchecked.
Finn| Finn and Jake's treehouse?
Me-Mow| Mm-hmm.
Finn| Who are you, and why do you want to get revenge?
Me-Mow| I... Am... Me-Mow!
Finn| Me-Mow?! Whoa.
Finn| You've gotten bigger.
Me-Mow| Have we met before?
Jake| Finn, is that you?
BMO| That's Jackrabbit Johnson!
Me-Mow| Finn?
Me-Mow| It is Finn!
Me-Mow| Tricked again!
Jake| Look... It's me-mow, BMO.
BMO| I don't care.
BMO| That's my bounty!
BMO| Yaah!
BMO| Jake, transform...
BMO| Horse!
Jake| Whoa, did you have a real gun all this time?
BMO| I am old enough to vote.
Me-Mow|  Hey, Jake, if you can hear my internal monologue, I'm going to kill you!
BMO| Your Daisy days are over!
BMO| I am the whaler 'round these parts!
BMO| Huh.
Me-Mow| Sounds like you're out of ammo.
BMO| No, you heard incorrectly.
BMO| Bang, bang, bang!
Me-Mow| I'm coming for you!
Me-Mow| Ugh!
Me-Mow| Blast you, Finn and Jake and Angel Face.
Me-Mow| This prison cell's not going to hold me.
Finn| Oh?
Me-Mow| Hey, Finn and Jake! I'll get my revenge! You hear me?! Revenge!
Finn| Hey, BMO, are you sure you took down all the wanted posters?
BMO| Yes.
Armadillo| Stick 'em up.
Finn| Huh?
BMO| This bounty belongs to me!
BMO| Get out of here!
Armadillo| Yaah!
Finn| Thanks, BMO.
BMO| You're welcome.
Finn|  Boiled eggs. In the fridge.
Finn| Jake! You're back! I've missed you so mu- Oh.
Jermaine| Uh, hi Finn. It's just me.
Finn| Jermaine! You and Jake both have sort of a grapefruit nature to you.
Jermaine| I came to your playhouse because I'm worried about Jake.
Finn| Don't worry, he's fine. He left a note.
Jermaine| How long ago did he leave that?
Finn| Uh, I dunno. Maybe five weeks?
Jermaine|  Whoo. Finn, you know you can call me if you're in trouble, right? Our brother's missing, and I come here finding you doing a lazy man's load with a hundred boiled eggs.
Finn| It's all they have at the store.
Jermaine|  I'm just worried, 'cause I had a dream about Jake - a vision.
Jermaine| I think he's all alone in outer space. I don't think he can come home, and he's running out of birthday cake and cocktail hot dogs.
Finn| Jake's in space?!
Jermaine|  I know! It's chilling.
Finn| Hmm. Oh! So, this cosmic stuff, planets and space...  This is Normal Man-type subjects.  We're going to Mars!
Jermaine|" Mars?!  Is it too much to hope that ""Mars"" is the name of some bookstore you like?"
Jermaine| Is that a boat? I haven't seen a boat in years.
Jermaine| Ah, this is a pretty old house. What's that on the shelf? A little pegasus?
Jermaine| Into the basement. Sure is lots of broken glass and decay down here. I'll be honest - I was just talking a lot because I'm nervous.
Finn|  I know.
Finn|  Jake.
Jermaine|  Mars.
Finn| Dang. Looking real prosperous around here.
Jermaine| Who's the statues, do you think?
Finn| Maybe Margles? But I've only seen a photo of her. Wait! Betty?
Betty| Oh, Finn. Uh, how is-
Finn| I haven't seen you, Betty, since you double-crossed everyone.
Betty| I-
Finn| Ya slopped up!
King Man| Finn! Empathy! 
Finn| Normal Man.
King Man| Nay! King Man!  Finn, Betty is tormented. Just look at her.
Finn| Oh.
Betty| I'm trying to get better. I'm filling this hole with sand - grain by grain. 
King Man| We're going to cure Betty's obsession with the Ice King and the magical madness inflicted upon her.
Betty|  G-G-G-G-Gah
Finn| If you inflicted it on her, shouldn't you be filling the hole?
King Man| Empathy, Finn. 
Finn| Aah!
King Man| Okay, so, Jake's in space.
Jermaine| Yeah.
King Man| And you don't know where in space.
Jermaine| Yeah.
King Man|" And you don't know where in space, even though literally every single place in this dimension is  ""in space""."
Jermaine| Again, yeah.
King Man| You are a real cutie. Okay, here we are. To locate Jake, you will need to retrieve our space telemetry capsule - deep within Mars at the end of a deadly three-part mind maze.
King Man| Don't fret, cowardly dog. Betty will go with you.
Betty| I... should really get back to my sand.
Finn| Nah. You should come with us.
King Man| Now, only Martians may enter the maze, so you'll need hats to fool the guard over there.
Jermaine| Okay, cool. Where are the hats?
King Man| Space.
Jermaine| Wha- Aw, come on, man!
Jermaine| Eeh!
Finn|  Um, Door Man?
Guard Man|  I'm Guard Man.
Finn| Well, I am Boy Man.
Jermaine| Uh, and I'm... Jer Man.
Guard Man| Sure. 
Finn|"  ""Jer Man"" was really funny."
Jermaine| Thanks, Finn.
Finn| Hey Jermaine, get a load of these frogs. What do you think's going on with all these frogs, Jermaine? Jermaine?
Jermaine| What? I don't know.
Finn| Oh, whoa. That one looks different - kinda... special.
Finn| Yip! 
Fern frog| Remember!
Finn| Whew!
Betty| Finn!
Finn| I'm okay. These guys mean business, though. If you look them in the eyes, they get outraged.
Finn| You got all that, Betty? Betty! Hup!
Betty| Oh! There's more on this side.
Finn|  Hyup!
Betty| Guys, I think I figured out the frog puzzle.  It's really quite simple.
Betty| I found the next challenge! I think maybe if I solve this equation, we'll be able to pass through to the next chamber.
Finn| And if we mess up, that guy pecks our tummies open, right? 
Betty| No. See, the work is already full of errors. I just need to correct them.
Jermaine| Um, I'm not trying to complain or anything, but none of these puzzles have anything... to do with... me.
Betty|  Look see? This quadrinomial has been improperly factored. He forgot to double cube root the bottom partial nominator.  There we go. I'll have us out of here in no time.
Finn| Well, just let me know if you need any help - with anything besides these maths problems.
Betty|  X plus square, hypotenuse cubed plus Y minus three... 
Finn| Hey! He's jukin' the stats!
Betty| What?
Finn| He's changing the dang numbers around!
Betty| He's changing. Oh no.
Finn|  Come on, Jermaine!
Jermaine| Up there? You're gonna break your neck!
Finn| Hey!
Finn|  If anyone else feels like solving any of these puzzles, just jump right in, you know?
Jermaine| Hey! Over here! I hear something.
Past Betty| ...if you water them once a week they'll totally be fine. No! I know! Six months studying ancient petroglyphs in the Outback?!  I can't believe it! 
Betty| That's me.
Jermaine| Uh-doy!
Finn| You looks so happy. And sane.
Betty|  I was. But I never took that trip. I met Simon the next day, and he was just so amazing. I put everything on hold to help him search for the Enchiridion.
Jermaine| Listen, Betty, I may not be a psychiatrist or a life coach, or even know what you're talking about, but maybe you should try focusing on yourself a little more, you know?
Betty|" Can I though? I spent so much time dedicated to Simon I'm not sure there's even any ""me"" left anymore."
Past Betty| Good point, Future Betty! Maybe it is too late to save you, but with your power and my joie de vivre-ay, maybe the two of us could save Simon together! Think about it.
Finn| Oh, come on, Betty! Get it together! Even if you are a lost cause, she-
Jermaine| -Or whatever she represents-
Finn| -is not.
Past Betty| Or am I? 
Betty| No, Finn's right. You'll thank me for this later, Past Betty.
Past Betty| Hmph.
Past Betty|  And don't forget to water my plants. Okay, got to go! My flight leaves in an hour!
Finn| Good job, Betty.
Betty| Thanks, Finn. Sorry I couldn't be more help. I was a little preoccupied.
Jermaine| Oh really?
Finn| Anyway, where's the space thingy?  Space thingy! Space thingy!
Jake| Space what-y?
Finn and Jermaine| Jake!
Jake| Hey everybody.
Finn| Hey, long time no see, brudda! 
Jake|  Hey, what's with the hair, brudda?
Finn| Man, you're lucky you missed it. I had lice crazy-bad! I think I got them from Marceline, who got them from Ice King.
Jake|  Nice.
Finn| Anyway, how'd you even get here?
Jermaine| Eugggh! 
Jake| Beats me. I was just eating a sausage on some stupid planet, then all of a sudden there was a beautiful rainbow explosion and a loud noise - sort of like a space telemetry capsule activating. Then here I was, standing next to this Mars door.
King Man| Congratulations, everybody. Now, who's ready for a nice boiled egg?
Finn| Me!
Jake| Me!
Jermaine| Wait a minute. What even happened in there? Where's the telemetry capsule?
King Man| Don't you see, Jermaine? You were inside the capsule all along, learning valuable lessons while you programmed its Jake-extracting telemetry with your minds.
Jermaine| Of course.
King Man| And you, Betty - finally you've learned that most pressing of lessons - that sometimes, for our own good, we must accept the loss of that which we hold most dear.
Betty|  I've learned that I just got to work even harder to get it back.
King Man| What?!
Betty| Like, did you see Finn in there? He was indomitable!
King Man| Yeah I guess but-
Betty| So as I stared into that endless white void, I came up with a plan.
King Man| A plan?
Betty| For me, to save my Simon, and for you, to finally pull Margles back from the maw of GOLB.
King Man|  Marg-
Finn|   Whoop! Huh?
Jake|   Whoop!
Lumpy Space Princess|   Whoopiiieee...
Princess Bubblegum|  Cheers, Lumpy Space Princess.
Jake|  Bouncing!
Finn|  Princess, this tea party sucks in a big way! But thanks for the invite!
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, don't worry, Finn. The Mallow Tea Ceremony takes years to master.
Finn|  Princess! I think I just now mastered it!  One more bounce.  Alright!  Unh! Tea partying's hard, huh, Jake?
Jake|   Oof! Yes!
Lumpy Space Princess|  What?! No way! It's super easy!
Finn|  Lumpy Space Princess, you big faker! You're floating, not bouncing!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Fine. I'll prove it.  Huh? Ah! Oh, no!  Oh, snap! 
Jake|  AAAAAGH!
Lumpy Space Princess|   Oh. Sorry I bit your leg.
Jake|  You're still biting me!!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, my gosh. Oh, right. Sorry.
Finn|  Dude! Your leg!
Jake|  This is... new. It's nothin' ominous, though. Just a bump.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Nah, that's no bump. It's the early stage of the lumps.
Finn|  Is it serious?
Lumpy Space Princess|  It just means he's changing into a Lumpy Space guy, on account of my bite. It's just like, um, y'know... werewolf rules?  Ar, rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr rawr!
Finn|  Oh, no!
Jake|  What? You think I'm gonna turn all lumpy like her? Get outta here.  Wha? Finn, I think I'm freakin' out!
Finn|  Calm down, bud! I'll... I'll sock the lumpiness outta ya!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey, now!  Royal intervention! Surely there must be an antidote to the lumps.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Yeah. There's an antidote, but you have to go all the way to Lumpy Space to get it. And Jake has to use it by sunset.
Princess Bubblegum|  What happens if he doesn't take the antidote by sunset?
Lumpy Space Princess|  He'll be lumpy, like, forever.
Finn|  LSP, please! Can you tell us how to reach Lumpy Space?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Yeah, I mean, there's a portal nearby. I can show you whenever.
Finn and Jake|   Take us now! Take us now!
Princess Bubblegum|   I should not have drunk that much tea! 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Don't go telling everyone about this portal or whatever. It's kind of a secret.
Finn|  Where is it?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Portal's that Frog and mushroom.
Frog|  Password, please.
Lumpy Space Princess|   Whatevers2009!!
Frog|  Good day, Princess. Is your father okay with you entering Lumpy Space with two...  non-Lumpers?
Finn|   Just say yes! Yes, yes, yes!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Yeah, whatever, fine.
Finn|  AAAAH!! Whoa... Lumpy Space. So, where's the antidote?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Hold it. First, you should check out my house. It's, like, kind of lame, but way less lame than, like, your house.
Jake|  Uh, could you skip to the part where you tell us where the antidote is?
Lumpy Space Princess|  It's up there at Makeout Point.
Finn|  That's so close! We can run there in no...  ...time. Aww, what?!! It's, like, a million-mile fall into space!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Yeah. You have to travel by car in my world, or else you'll fall into the Lumpy Abyss.
Lumpy Space King|  Daughter!! Have you brought smooth people into our domain?!
Lumpy Space Princess|  I had to, Dad... I'm trying to help them, so don't lumping yell at me!
Lumpy Space Queen|  WHAT DID YOU SAY?! What did you just say?!?
Lumpy Space Princess|"  I SAID, ""LUMP OFF,"" MOM!!! "
Finn|  Uh...
Lumpy Space Princess|   WHAT?!?!
Finn|  Vroom vroom??
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, yeah.  I need to borrow the car.
Lumpy Space King|  You have made your mother cry for the last time, daughter! You are hereby banned from using the royal car!! 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Shucks! I lumping hate them! I'm really, really sorry, Finn. But I can't help you because my parents are horrible idiots.
Finn|  Don't you know anyone else with a car?
Lumpy Space Princess|  My friend Melissa has a car. But she's dating my ex-boyfriend Brad.
Finn|   Call her NOW.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Hmm.   Call BFF 66.
Melissa|   Hello?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Hey, Melissa. What's up?
Finn|  What's she saying?
Lumpy Space Princess|   I'm asking her, jeez! Melissa, just listen!
Melissa|  Have you forgotten what day it is?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Melissa. I'm trying to help out some friends.
Melissa|  Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, Glob. I forgot.
Finn|  What'd she say?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Tonight is the weekly Promcoming Dance!  It's gonna be so flipping awesome!
Finn|   LSP, we don't have time for this. Ask for the ride, LSP.
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh—  Wha?!
Finn|   Melissa,  you should totally drive us to Makeout Point to make out with hot boys!
Melissa|  LSP, you're so baaaaad... be there in a sec!
Finn|  Biyah. 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Hmm. 
Finn|   Sorry. But Jake's lumpiness is worsening!
Jake|  Actually, I think I'm beating it back with sheer willpower!   Oh, my. 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Yeah, whatever. Just don't mess with my phone again.
Melissa|  Hi!
Finn|  Ugh... OKAY! Let's go, let's go, let's go!!
Jake|  Aw, Finn, this music ducks, right?  Ah. I love this song. We should totally TP Shandala's house!  Gracious! That was terrible! Finn, if you can't save me from the lumps... if I do turn... if I become lumpy like them, I want you to—
Finn|   It's not gonna come to that. But if it does, I'll bury you beneath the nicest, most shadiest tree!
Jake|  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm saying that if I go totally lumpy, then I want you to get used to lumpy Jake. What did you think I was sayin'?
Finn|  Oh, um...  Heh heh.  CAN'T THIS CAR GO ANY FASTER?!
Melissa|  We're already here! Hi, Finn.
Lumpy Space Princess|  We've been here for, like, five minutes.
Finn|  Finally! Huh? This doesn't look like Makeout Point.
Melissa|  This is Brad's house. You wanted a ride to Makeout Point? You think I want to make out with you?!
Finn|  Uh...
Melissa|   Well, maybe I do, but... wait.  I HAVE A BOYFRIEND, FINN!! 
Finn|  LSP, we gotta hurry! Jake's running out of time!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Hey. This is hard for me, too. I mean, I used to eat chili cheese fries with Brad... so there's gonna be a lot of romantic tension on this ride!
Brad|  Hey.
Melissa|  Oh, Braaaaad... 
Brad|  You miss me yet, LSP?
Lumpy Space Princess|   Scooch over, Finn. I'm gonna sit in the back.
Lumpy Space Princess|  This is it.
Finn|  Let's go!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Wait. Watch yourself, Finn. The guys who use the antidote up here are notorious for being...  smooth posers.
Finn|  What does that mean?
Lumpy Space Princess|  It just means what it means. Hurry. Get the antidote so we can get outta here.
Finn|  Thanks, LSP.
Lumpy Space Princess|  BUUUUMPS.
Jake|  Um... bumps.
Finn|  Uh, yeah, bumps.
Jake|  Aw, man!
Finn|  Hey, guys. Lookin' smooth!
Glasses|  Really? You think we're smooth?
Finn|  Well, mostly you in the center, but yeah!
Monty|  Why are you sucking up to us?
Finn|  My best friend needs an antidote for lumpiness.
Lenny|  Chyah, lumpiness suuucks. Hey, Monty, time's up, sphere-hog!  My turn! 
Finn|  So the antidote is in that orb you were sitting on!
Lenny|  This orb is the antidote, bruh.
Finn|  Can my friend borrow it?
Lenny|  Yeah, sure, as long as you give it right back. 
Finn|  Hammacow. Thanks, fellas.
Lumpy Space Princess|  What's taking so long? Did those smooth-heads give you the orb already, or what?
Finn|  Wait!!
Lenny|  Is this another friend of yours?
Lumpy Space Princess|  What do you care? Just give 'em the antidote already, and stop being such a poser.
Monty|  Sorry, kid.  We changed our minds.
Finn|  Why did you have to say all those rude things to them?!
Lumpy Space Princess|  What? I was helping you.
Finn|   Thanks a lot!  They were right about to hand over the antidote!
Lumpy Space Princess|   You're welcome a lot.
Finn|  You insulted them! And they got mad! And now Jake's gonna be lumpy forever! THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Wow. Now I know how you really feel. I was just trying to help, but whatever.  No. No, not whatever! I know I mess things up sometimes, but I'm really trying! And you're supposed to be my friend!  Not like the fake ones I have here! So do what you want! I'm going to Promcoming! Are you coming or not, Lumpy Jake?
Jake|  No. Because no matter how messed up and lumpy I get, this guy never turns his back on me!  Oh, yah. Right behind ya. Just gotta turn my back on this guy. 
Finn|  JAKE! IT'S ALMOST SUNSET!!  Jake... I didn't save him... I...  I'LL KILL YOU, LUMPY SPAAAAAACE!!
Monty|  Jam on, man!
Finn|  Huh? I thought you guys left!
Monty|  We were drawn back by your plaintive wail. We dig your directionless fury.
Finn|  Um, thanks.
Monty|  Respect. Here.  Take it. Win your girl back!
Finn|  Yeah, there's no girl. But there is still time to save Jake! Do you guys know where Promcoming is?
Monty|  Promcoming takes place way down on that land-lump.
Finn|  Awesome. Do any of y'all have wheels?
Monty|  Nah. We were all ditched here just like you.
Finn|  Well... you think I can make it to that land-lump if I jumped off this cliff?
Monty|  You kidding?! A smoothie like you will plummet right into the eternal void!
Finn|  What if I was lumpy? Could I float over?
Lenny|  No, no! It's too dangerous!
Glasses|  I'd say there's a 50/50 chance of you making it!
Finn|  That's good enough for me. Now bite me!!
Finn|   Yes! I can feel the multiple bites accelerating the lumpification process! I'm starting to float!
Lenny|  Don't jump, guy!!
Finn|  I have to! For my buddy.  RAAAAAAGH!!!!
Glasses|  Wow. He's insane.
Finn|  Ah, I made it! And there he is!
Jake|  Yeah! Promcoming! Yeah! Cool!
Finn|  Jake! I'm mostly lumpy now! And I totally think you should sit on this sphere!
Jake|  No!
Finn|  Sit on it!
Jake|   No!!
Finn|  Please, Jake! You're my best friend! Just sit on the sphere!
Jake|  Chyah! I remember you! You're just a smoothie wannabe lumpy poser!
Finn|  Sit on it!! Before I turn completely lumpy!!
Jake|  NO!!
Finn|  Oh, no! I can feel the lumpiness... about to consume me!!  Oh, yah. Being lumpy's the best.
Jake|  Hey. Stop talkin' to yourself, dumb guy. Take your ball and get outta here.
Finn|  Fine. I don't want you to have it anyway.
Jake|  So I can't have it now, eh?
Finn|  That's right. It's mine.
Jake|  GIMME THAT BALL!!
Finn|  NO! You can't have it!
Jake|  I want it! Give it to me!
Finn|  You want it that bad? Go get it, then!
Jake|  Bumps, bi—   Oh, I'm not lumpy anymore! Oh, no. Finn buddy! You gotta sit on this!
Finn|  No! You can't make me! Smooth—OOF! 
Jake|  Finn! Hey, Finn! Hey, buddy! Finn
Finn|   Huh?
Jake|  Hey, dude. We made it.
Finn|  Man... There's something cold under my butt.  Oh!  The antidote! Just in time, too! LSP, I'm sorry I blew up at you before. I didn't mean it. I was just really stressed out.
Lumpy Space Princess|  You know, it's fine. You and Jake can make it up to me by dancing this last dance with me.
Finn|  Sounds good to me. Whaddaya say, Jake?
Jake|   That sounds totally lame.
Jake|   I'm just kidding. Let's dance!
Jake| Ah. 
BMO| Stand and deliver, boy, because I'm Robbing Hood. Give me all your funny money, Sheriff of Naughty-hams.
Neptr| But BMO, I don't want to be the bad guy. I want to be Robbing Hood's pal, Friar Tux.
BMO| No, Neptr.  Ha ha! Friar Tux would never have a mustache like that. 
Neptr| No fair. En guard!
BMO| On Blitzen!
BMO| You're terrible!
BMO| Whoa!
BMO| Eeeee!
Neptr| Aaaaa!
Jake|  What? Hey! What are you kids doing breaking the treehouse?
BMO| Uh...
Finn| Yo, BMO, what happened?
BMO| You got too much money, honey. All of this dosh is threatening the structural integrity of the treehouse.
Finn| Who would have thought we could have too much treasure?
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| I'm sorry, master.
Finn & Jake| Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant!
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| You told me to stay inside the money room, but now I am outside. What is your punishment, master?
Finn| No punishment, dude. Just chill where you are.
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| All right. I will chill where I am until you command me.
Finn| So what should we do with all this swash?
BMO| You should give it to Robbing Hood.
Jake| No way, BMO. This is our treasure.
BMO| Aw.
Finn| Hey, maybe we could, like, spend it?
Jake| Really? How much of it?
Finn| Dude, like all of it. Then we can find completely new treasure.
Neptr| Neptr knows just the place to blow your grease. Behold, this recent advertisement. 
Jake| Whoa! We get mail?
Finn| Check it out, Jake.
Jake| Dang! Wildberry Kingdom got all fancy.
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| I continue to chill.
BMO|  Come on, Naughty-Hams.
Patron| Thank you.
Finn| Nice place. So how are we gonna spend all this gish?
Jake| I don't know. I've never really spent money before. I've only stolen it or hoarded it.
Finn| Ha!
Jake|   So... here we are in the middle of town.
Jake| Let's parse out some dough to spend.
Strawberry Guard| Hey! What are you doing? No people or money allowed in the fountain, ya dums! Where's your sense at?!
Jake| Sorry, man. We were just looking to spend some cash in town.  Want some?
Strawberry Guard| Fellas, goofing in a public fountain is punishable by a lashing, and you're trying to bribe me.
Strawberry Guard| Ooh! Now that's what I'm talking about, fellas.   Have a good time in the fountain.
Jake| Whoa. Spending money is kind of fun.
Finn| Yeah, this'll be easy.  Ho, ho, young berry lads!
Wildberry kid| Yeah?
Finn| Go buy the most expensive meats and furniture to adorn our new fountain home. Keep the change for your families in need. Hyup! 
Wildberry kid| Thanks, but we're, uh, middle-class.
Finn| Really?
Wildberry kid| Uh, yeah, upper middle.
Jake| Just get the darn furniture.
Strawberry Guard| Hey, no furniture or meat in the fountain! You'll wreck up the water!
Strawberry Guard| You can't buy me off twice, fellas.
Strawberry Guard|  Ah, maybe you can, fellas, maybe you can. 
Finn| Dude, we bought all this furniture and meat, and we still have a ton of gamboni left.
Jake| Hmm.  Look at those gams! Hey, yo, Legs! Legs! You want a bag of money?
Legs| Sure!
Jake| Well, what are you gonna do for it?
Legs| Well, um, I'm a dancer by trade.
Jake| Show me. 
Legs| Hup!
Jake|  Finn, look. I made this guy dance.
Finn| Yeah, man. Whoo!
Strawberry Guard| Hold it! No dancing in the streets without a permit!
Jake| Go away, dude.
Strawberry Guard| Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
Strawberry Guard| All right, I'm going!
Jake|  This is crazy. People do anything for money. And I've got a ton of money. Dance harder, Legs! Harder!
Jake|   This bores me. You're boring! It's time to push this thing further. Middle-class berries, watch after this treasure while I'm gone. 
Wildberry kids| Okay.
Jake| Ahem.
Goji Berry Man| Mabel, do you hear something?
Jake| Good evening.
Wildberry People| Oh no! We're being robbed!
Finn| Oh, no, we're not robbers. We're actually here to give you money.
Goji Berry Man| What?
Jake| Listen. I want to see you two do things  for this bag of money.
Goji Berry Man| Okay, man.
Jake|  Yeah, nice. Goji Berry Man, you sleep on the left side of the bed normally. Now you sleep on the right!
Goji Berry Man| Okay.
Mabel| I don't like sleeping on your side. It's too close to the wall!
Jake| Mr. Goji Berry, you sleep on your back now—and on top of the covers.
Goji Berry Man| I can't sleep on my back, man. I got sleep apnea. I won't get any sleep. My wife won't get any sleep. My dance instructing will suffer.
Jake| Turning down all this smoosh, huh? Dance instruction pays more than I thought. 
Goji Berry Man| Wait, man! There's got to be something else we can do to get those gold coins.
Jake| Well, sure, man. As a matter of fact, you can have all the gold coins... all the gold coins you can eat!
Jake| Dinner is served!  Yummy, yummy, yummy. Hey, you kids need some desert? I'll just see what I can rustle up—in the toolshed!  
Finn| Guys, I'm super sorry about my friend. Here. 
Finn| Don't eat it, ya dums!
Jake| How much do you think I'd have to pay them to lick the dust off all this dusty stuff?
Finn| Dude, I do not approve of the way you're spending money right now.
Jake| Dude, they're not doing anything they don't want to. They want my sweet cheddar, and I want to see some stuff in exchange. It's mutual—free market.
Finn| What?
Jake| Free market! 
Finn|  Don't worry, brother. I'll help you see the error of your ways.
Finn| Berry lads! Berry lads! I need to spend all this blingo fast.
Wildberry kid| Okay.
Finn| Take me to the seediest alley in the kingdom.
Wildberry kid| That's Crudberry Back Alley... in Crud Town.
Finn| Friendly Crudberries, I have money for you! Come get it!
Hobos| Money? Money!
Finn| Easy, fellas! Let's pass these out one at a time.
Finn| Hey, take it easy, breh.
Hobo| Give us that money! 
Finn| I-I-I don't want any trouble.  I'm trying to help you.
Finn|  Whew! 
Jake| How much coin would it take for you to be my berry foot warmer?
Finn| Dude!
Jake| Oh, hey, man.
Finn| Jake, this money is bad. We got to get rid of all of it right now.
Jake| Okay, I got a plan. And this time, it's gonna involve all the money.
Wildberry Princess| Finn and Jake?
Jake| Princess, are you ready to earn all this cay-ash?
Wildberry Princess| What...?
Jake| All of this sweet, sweet crunkle is yours if you let me...  sit on your head.
Wildberry Princess|  Get out of here!
Jake|  No one can say no to this much dinero. ♪M-m-money♪
Wildberry Princess| Jake, I am warning you.
Jake| ♪M-m-money♪
Jake| ♪M-m-money♪
Wildberry Princess| Aah! Guards! Guards! Seize Finn and Jake and prepare them for execution!
Jake| Or don't do that and get paid mad bucks.
Wildberry Princess| And take all their money!
Jake| Take all my money?!
Jake| Well, we were trying to get rid of all that skrilla anyway, right?
Wildberry Princess| Finn and Jake, yes, you have insulted me, but worse than that, you have abused the power of money!
Wildberry Princess| We will deal with you swiftly and ironically by encasing you in your own molten gold!
Wildberry Princess| Release the golden flood!
Strawberry Guard| Oh, no! Aah!
Wildberry Princess| Who dares?
BMO| Ho, ho, ho! Robbing Hood is the defender of the poor!
Neptr| Me too!
Jake| Good shot, BMO!
BMO| I was aiming for the rope.  Yeah!
Jake| Let's bounce, po' boy.
Wildberry Princess| Finn and Jake, if you ever return to Wildberry Kingdom again, I'll have you double-dipped in gold! Unless I get a written apology.
Finn| Huh? Gold piece. You want to flip to see who writes that apology letter?
Jake| How about you write it, I sign it.
Finn|  No way, man.
Finn and Jake|  Yeeeaaah!
Finn|  What's for B-fast, Jake?
Jake|  Everything burrito!   I love you, everything burrito.  Oh, man. I think someone wants to eat everything burrito! I won't let 'em get ya, baby! 
Finn|  Jake! Come on! Get ready!
Jake|   Ready!
Finn and Jake|  Yaaaaah!
Cute King|  Peep!
Jake|  So cute!
Finn|  Look at their little faces! Haha!
Jake|  Haha!
Cute King|  We're not cute! We're evil, ...and we're here to dominate you!
Finn|  Get the camera, Jake!
Jake|  I can't! I'm paralyzed by the cuteness!
Finn and Jake|  BMO! BMO! BMO! BMO!
BMO|  What? What? What? What?
Finn and Jake|  BMO! Get the camera!
BMO|  BMO is camera!
Cute King|  Enough! Now... bow down to me, Cute King, and my legion of Cuties!
Finn|  Great shot, BMO!
Cute King|  Since you won't take us seriously, we will kill you. Until then, enjoy your burrito, Jake.
Jake|   Huh?
Jake|  My burrito!
Finn|  It's perfectly fine.
Jake|  No, Finn... They probably poisoned it!
Finn|  Naaaaawww...
Jake|  They knew my name. They knew about the burrito.
Finn|  Man, you're letting your brain dial turn your fear volume up. You'll see. Those Cuties are nothing but an afternoon's delight.
Finn|  Jake? What're you doing in my bed?
Jake|   Oh, nothing much. You know, just... chillin'.
Finn|  Wait a second... Are you still messed up about those little guys?
Jake|   A little.
Finn|  Look, man, whaddaya say tomorrow morning we go track those little guys down and find out just what their deal is? Sound good, buddy?
Jake|  Yeah. Thanks, buddy.  Man, you sound just like Mom sometimes.
Finn|  Yeah. Good ol' Mom.
Jake|  She always knew just what to say.
Finn|  Yeah. Goodnight, brudda.
Jake|  Goodnight.  Finn! Finn!  Finn, wake up, man!
Finn|  Wha? Huh?
Jake|  I think someone's in the house.  For real, man! Shh, listen.
Finn|  Uh...
Jake|  I swear, man! I really heard something.  Finn!!
Finn|  I heard.  Okay. Who's out there?
Jake|  What the—?! That's my sword!  What do they want with my sword, man?!   It came from downstairs.
Finn|  Alright. That's it.
Jake|  Where are you going?
Finn|  I'm gonna go man-handle those guys's banandles! 
Jake|   ...What?! 
Finn|  Well, they broke a window, but I don't see any of 'em.  I guess they left. 
Jake|  Oh, no. OH, AWWW, NO!
Finn|  Jake, what is it?!
Jake|   Awww, no! It's a dead goat, man! Its guts are all over the place! It's all chopped up and spread around and...  Ah, no, wait, it's just a blanket. I think I left it here this morning.
Voice|  Jaaaake! Fiiiinn! This is the voice of your moooom! I've come back to tell you how dumb you always aaaare!  I hate you guys so muuuuch!
Finn|  Get 'im, Jake!
Jake|  Aaah! Aaah!
Finn|  Jake, I got 'im! He's freakin' out, man! What do I do?!
Jake|  Shake 'im!
Finn|  What?!
Jake|  Shake 'im around 'til he stops!
Finn|  Okay.  Rrrrrrr!  They stopped.
Jake|  Okay. Now tell 'im not to talk about our mom!
Finn|  How do you even know our mom?
Cutie's first head|  We've been watching you.
Cutie's second head|  Learning your weaknesses.
Finn|  What?! Why?!
Cutie's first head|  For tomorrow morning.
Cutie's second head|  When our army comes and kills you both.
Cutie's first head|  You think we're so cute, when actually... we're the opposite of that!! 
Jake|  Hold 'im!
Finn|  Oh, gross. 
Jake|  Well?! Do you believe me now, Finn?!
Finn|  I... I don't know what to believe anymore.
Jake|  Well, that's close enough. Let's start settin' up some barricades!
Jake|  There's gotta be a thousand of 'em!
Finn|  Wait. Jake, look.
Jake|   These guys aren't a threat to anyone.
Finn|  These guys are a threat to themselves.
Finn|  Oh, hey, it's what's-his-face!
Cute King|  No... My men! Quickly, men! Pick yourselves up before the enemy sees!  Come on, now. That's it. Easy does it.  Bravest warriors! I ask you must we have our butts handed to us by everyone we meet?! How will we ever splash around in the brains of our enemies if you guys can't take two steps without exploding?! Bliblob, I'm lookin' at you!  Can I please just get one victory?! ONCE?!  Now don't start that.  Don't you do it! 
Jake|  Wanna just smash 'em all?
Finn|  What?! No, man, look. These guys aren't gonna quit until they win or die, ...and they're not gonna win, so what if we let 'em win, just this once?
Jake|  What?! And mess up my stats?!
Finn|  No. We'd be winning by helping them to win. That's a win!  And then they'll be happy and leave us alone.
Jake|   Alright.
Finn|  Yessss! Now, let's rally an army so we can look intimidating.
Jake|  Who're we gonna call?
Finn|  All of our friends.
Finn|  My army of friends! Today, we will lose this battle, but we will also win it!  When the enemy charges, crumble like a cookie. When you feel their puny punches, fade like a flower, and writhe in your own blood!
BMO|  But, but... how are we to bleed if none of this is real?
Finn|  With faith, m'lady... and ketchup!
Jake|  Ketchup is delicious and deceiving!
Finn|  And hey, guys... Let's keep the acting subtle. Less is more.
Lumpy Space Princess|"  No way. First, I'm gonna fall in love with one of those little guys, and then I'm gonna fall out of love, and then, I'm gonna totally fake-die of a fake heart attack!  ""OH! MY HEART! MY HEART HURTS BECAUSE I FELL OUT OF LOVE! AND NOW I HAVE TO DIE! OOOOHHHHH!!!"""
Finn|  Get ready, y'all. Together, we fall!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Not yet, Cinnamon Bun!
Cute King|  YAAAAH!
Finn, Jake, Lumpy Space Princess, and BMO|  Whoa.
Finn|  Oh, no!  My blooood! 
Lumpy Space Princess|   One last kiss before dying, my love.  Farewell forever. Oh, oh, my heart! Waaah! 
Jake|   I'm dead.
Cute King|  Victory... is... OURS!  Finally. I can do the victory dance!  La! La-da! La-da-da la! La-da-da la da!  La-la-da-la-la-la! 
Jake|  BAAAHAHAHAHAHA! Ah, I'm sorry, everybody! Ah, I couldn't keep it in! Hahahaha!
Cute King|  No...  This is ketchup?!
Jake|   Tastes better than blood. Or does it? Hey, Finn, you think blood tastes better than ketchup?
Finn|  Jake. Look. 
Jake|  Aw, nuts.
Finn|  Cute King, wait up.
Jake|   We wanna apologize for being fakers.
Finn|  We did it to protect you from yourselves.
Cute King|  It doesn't matter now. No one will ever fear our strength.
Finn|  But strength isn't your strength. Adorable cuteness is!
Cute King|  Can I use it to control others?
Finn|  Um... yeah, sure! Just be righteous about it.
Cute King|  Show me where to start.
Ice King|  Huh? Who could that be? 
Cute King|  I command you to make me a sandwich!
Ice King|  What?! No one commands the Ice King to make no sandwich!
Cute King|   What about now?
Ice King|   Okay.
Lady Rainicorn|  흑흑흑 안돼. 내가 왜 그랬을까?  
Lady Rainicorn|  걔네들 찾았어요? 
Princess Bubblegum|  My GPS shows Finn and Jake over there . I think that's where the Ice King has them hostage.
Lady Rainicorn|  걔네들 안전할까요? 
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm sure the boys are fine. The Ice King isn't usually a serious threat.  Besides, this'll be easy with the two of us.  We've got science on our side.
Tea robot|  Your tea is ready.  Pouring. Pouring.
Lady Rainicorn|  제이크가 실종되기 전에 내가 월남국수 면이 질기다고 말했어요. 아, 내가 왜 그런 말을 했을까. 무슨 나쁜 일이 생겼으면 어떡해?! 걔가 만든 국수 맛없다고 한 게 우리의 마지막 대화였어요. 
Princess Bubblegum|  It's okay, Lady. Jake knows you love him.
Lady Rainicorn|  미안해요. 내가 국수를 너무 많이 먹었나 봐요. 
Princess Bubblegum|  Don't worry. Just try to relax.  I'll work on my holo-entry.  It's been three weeks since Finn and Jake disappeared while battling the Ice King. I've activated a secret GPS implanted in Finn's ear. It has lead us to an uncharted black ice cave... but I've spent hours calculating every possible danger and am well-prepared.
Lady Rainicorn|  그놈이 칼을 들고 덤비면 어떡해요?! 
Princess Bubblegum|   Then I'll pull out my Electrode gun.
Lady Rainicorn|  그놈이 공주님을 해치려고 하면요?! 
Princess Bubblegum|   Then... I'll use my Ball Blam Burglerber! Lady, it'll be fine.   We've got science!
Lady Rainicorn|"  아.. 맞아요, 내가 좀 걱정이 심한 편이죠. 전 반 살은 시체들이 우리 집을 공격하는 악몽에 시달려요. 우리 삼촌, 외숙모, 사촌들이 다 집에 있었어요. 아기가 위층에서 우는 소리까지 생생히 들린다니까요. 내가 우리 가족들을 지킬 수만 있다면 — 그 꿈 꾸는 동안 얼마나 스트레스 받으면 이빨까지 무지하게 갈아요.  다음날 일어나면 이빨들이 금 가있어요. 보통 전 그냥 그런 것 꿈이려니, 내가 걱정을 사서 하지 하며 잊어버리려고 해요. 제가 그 반 살은 시체들에게 정말 두 번이나 공격당했었잖아요.  I become too stressful during that dream. I even grind my own teeth!  When I wake up in the morning, all my teeth are cracked up! I usually try to forget about it, thinking that it's just a dream or I'm being paranoid, but I was actually attacked by zombies before, twice!"")"
Princess Bubblegum|  Hmm. I suppose that's true.  Let's roll.
Lady Rainicorn|  으으, 잘 안 보이네. 
Princess Bubblegum|  Hold up, Lady.
Lady Rainicorn|  뭐예요? 
Lady Rainicorn|  으! 아아! 그만해! 도와줘요! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Don't worry, Lady!  Ball Blam Burglerber-ber!  My field of vision!  HEY!!
Princess Bubblegum|  Lady, phase through the wall!
Lady Rainicorn|  공주님 무기들! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Come on. There's no turning back now.
Ice King|   This is total bunk! You copier! You're only in love with her because I'm in love with her!
Lady Rainicorn|   Ice King. 
Ice King|  I've been playing this game a lot longer than you, pal! I've been workin' my moves, smooth-talkin' 'er, showin' 'er magic tricks! Don't ignore me! Come back!
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm picking up three heart signatures. Ice King must be talking to Finn and Jake.  Go to the right, Lady.
Lady Rainicorn|  공주님 저 땀나게 만드시네요.   와, 이 방은 예쁜 새 소리에 대한 내 사랑보다 더 크네! 
Princess Bubblegum and Lady Rainicorn|  Ew.
Princess Bubblegum|  Lady!  Lady, are you okay?
Lady Rainicorn|"  으, 네. 걱정 마세요. 저 완전, 완전 괜찮아요. 자, 가요. 일어납시다!  으, 안 되겠네. 혼자 가세요. 전 짐만 될 뿐이에요.  Guh. I don't think I will make it anyway. You should just go alone. I'll just be a burden for you."")"
Princess Bubblegum|  No, Lady. I won't leave you while you're hurt. Come on. 
Princess Bubblegum|  What are you playing at, Ice King?  Three heart signatures. ...Getting closer.
Ice King|  Hey.
Princess Bubblegum|   AH!
Ricardio|  Princess! What a pleasant surprise...
Princess Bubblegum|  Ricardio!
Ricardio|  Yes, it is I. Did you find my dungeon stimulating?
Princess Bubblegum|   Where are Finn and Jake?!
Ricardio|  What do you see in those two?  A boy... and a dog. You deserve more mature companionship.
Princess Bubblegum|   Poisoned with Zanoits.
Ricardio|  You see, I thought I only wanted your heart, but I was wrong. I was unfair to you. I want the full package.  Princess...
Princess Bubblegum|  What...?
Ricardio|  I'm a man now.  I made myself this body for you, Princess,  Synthesized from Ice King's living tissue—his bones broken and reassembled.
Ice King|   It hurt, ooh, boy! How about a hug? Gimme a hug! I need it!  Oh!
Ricardio|  Silence, Simon!  All for you, Princess!  Now marvel at these powerful, articulate limbs! 
Princess Bubblegum|   STOP!
Ricardio|  Attached with supple and delicate sinews.
Princess Bubblegum|   AH!  LADY!
Ricardio|  Now, my darling, we can finally be united as man and wife.
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, Ricardio. I'll do it. I'll be your wife. 
Ricardio|  Ah!
Princess Bubblegum|   If you can beat me  at hand-to-hand combat!
Ricardio|  Oh, my... How Valkyrian. Princess, you are absolu— 
Princess Bubblegum|"  You think we're intellectual equals?! It only took me seconds to get you off your guard! And this ""body"" you designed is self-congratulatory garbage! See, I know a thing or two about building a body out of biomass,  and you don't... leave your heart exposed!"
Ricardio|  I just wanted to impress you!
Princess Bubblegum|  You didn't.  Get out of my sight.
Finn|   Princess? PRINCESS! RICARDIO IS BACK, HE'S IN THE BLACK ICE CAVE, AND HE'S PEACOCKING HARDCORE!
Princess Bubblegum|  I know... and he poisoned you both with Zanoits, but I took care of it.
Finn|  What happened? How did we get here?
Princess Bubblegum|  I dragged you all here on Lady's back.  It took two days. And another day to make you guys an antidote.   And fifteen minutes to build the Ice King a new heart.
Ice King|  Hey, Finn.  Hee hee!
Princess Bubblegum|  I made it out of Ricardio's sinews... and some toffee and maracas.
Ice King|  Coochie coochie coochie!
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm glad you guys are up. Please make the Ice King leave.
Ice King|  Hahaha! Shooka shooka shooka! 
Princess Bubblegum|  ICE KING, PLEASE LEAVE!!!
Ice King|   Ah-hay!!
Princess Bubblegum|  How are you feeling, Lady?
Lady Rainicorn|  제이크 깨어났어요? 
Princess Bubblegum|  Yes. He's awake.  Oh, Lady. I should have never put you in danger.  I saw on the heart monitor. I didn't know.
Lady Rainicorn|   괜찮아요. 비밀로 한 제가 잘못이죠.   Jake! 
Jake|   Lady! Oh, Lady!
Lady Rainicorn|"  자기야, 나 완전 중요한 할 말 있어.  나...  I..."") I am pregnant!"
Jake|  ...I'M... PUPPIES!?
Finn| Jake, so I just had this weird thought.
Jake| Well, that's normal; people always have weird thoughts around campfires.
Finn| Well, I don't know. Isn't is sort of strange that we keep pets? We kind of make them worship us.
Jake| What?! Nah. 
Finn| No, seriously, think about it. We're their only source of food and water and, like, tummy rubs. They basically have to love us.
Jake|  What's wrong with tummy rubs?
Finn| Yeah, tummy rubs are pretty great.  That one star is so crazy, looks like it's vibrating.  It's so cool. Wonder what it is, a planet? Do people live there? Are they friendly? Do they keep pets?
Jake| Alright buddy,  that's a little too much campfire. Time for bed. 
Finn| Whoa... holy.  Oh, dang.   Uh, okay.  Man, this is screwy. Maybe it's the can of beans we had for dinner.  Looks- uh- homey. Wuh-oh! Whoa-Aah!  Oh- right.
Mr. Fox|  Mmm, Boobafina, just pay me back when you can.
Finn| Aww.
Astral Mr. Fox| Hello? 
Finn| Oh! Hey, you can see me?!
Astral Mr. Fox| See you...? But if I didn't see you... Wait, what did you originally ask me?
Finn| Oh, forget it, it's cool.
Astral Mr. Fox| Do you, want a drink or something? I think I only have water anyway. .
Finn| Whoop, here I go! Bye!
Astral Mr. Fox| Oh, that was sort of rude. I hope he comes back. 
Finn|  That guy seemed lonely, not a lot of foxes up at this hour.  Guess you get a lot of work done though.
Bounce House Princess| Quittin' time!  You don't have to go home but ya', oh, you know how it goes! 
Finn| Bounce House Princess. . I didn't know B.H.P lived in a cave.  Hey, this place is pretty nice.
Finn|  Whoa!
Bounce House Princess|  Forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty-five. forty-six, four-seven, fourth-eight, forty-nine... fifty! . Fifty-one, fifty-two . Who's there?!
Bounce House Princess|  Oh my glob, oh my glob, oh my glob, oh my glob!   six four three two one! .
Finn|  Dude, what's your deal? 
Bounce House Princess|  Everything's okay now.
Finn| Aww, geez, poor Bounce House Princess.
Finn|  Wha?
Bounce House Princess|  Bounce House Princess, you listen to me! Are you gonna' shut yourself off from other people forever?! I mean he or she could be really nice and- okay, mm, maybe if I just say very still, it'll just- it will just go away. 
Finn|  Gosh, I hope BHP's okay, I feel bad for just splittin' like that. Maybe they sorted it out, they could have stuff in common. You never know until you speak to the person.  Oh, hey, Cloud Kingdom.
Finn|  What the? Ice King?
Ice King|  Yeah, I guess there's some cool people here, musics a little loud but the but the punch is top-drawer.
Lauren| Mm hmm
Ice King| Hey, you should come to one of my parties sometime; I'm friends with some pretty cool people too you know?
Lauren| Uh huh, who are your friends?
Ice King| Oh, uh- like that guy, Finn.
Lauren|  Finn?!
Ice King| Yeah, Finn and I are pretty tight!
Lauren| Hmmm
Cloud Woman 2|  Oh, hi, are you the ice-dude?
Ice King|  That's me, ice-dude. . Hey, have you ever seen the inside of an ice bear cave?
Lauren| Did you say you know Finn the Human?
Cloud Man 1|  Hey, buddy, buddy! Care to freshen me up?! 
Ice King| Yeah, yeah, now scram.
Lauren| Hey, is Finn seeing anyone right now? Could you introduce us?  Oh my glob! Is he here now?! 
Ice King| So I guess you're more into the 'little brother-type'? Huh.
Cloud Man 2|  Hey Lauren, I heard your grandpa's given out ice! 
Ice King|  Ice?! I'll give you ice!  Oh, looks like I put this party- on ice. Oh wait, you want ice? You, oh, you got iced!  Anyway, oh, don't look at me like that Lauren. . Eh, this party was weak anyway.
Finn|  Poor Simon. Poor Simon, I guess? Poor Simon... sort-of? It's like some part of him wants to be a sad wong-lord.  But why would anyone want that? Is there some... incentive? 
Finn|" Sheesh, I wonder if being a sad loner gives you more raw material to form song ideas. Is that where creativity comes from? From sad-biz?  I am so high up now. I am so high up, there is no ""high up"". It's all just...  Whoa! What the--? Whoooa!  Space Lards! Ah man, Jake would be flipping out; trying to get that super-rare milk. Make a sick flan with that milk. Oh, well."
Finn| Whoa! What's going on? You can't see me, right? 
Finn|  I'm in the Mother Lard! . What? Space birth!  Okay, here we go! Whoa!  Bye, guys. Oh, that was creative and it wasn't sad either so maybe birth is the greatest statement in all the universe.  Hey, baby, ya' gonna give me a boost? . Here comes Mars. What the heck is going on though?  Everybody's leaving!
Grob Gob Glob Grod| Fire defense missiles!
Star Man| Missiles away! Impact with Catalyst Comet in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!
Grob Gob Glob Grod| Yes! Do you think it worked, Star Man?
Star Man|  Uh, yeah, probably, right?  Shoot! No effect! It's still coming right at us!
Grob Gob Glob Grod| Was that all of our missiles?
Star Man| Uh, yeah, I'm surprised we even had those ones. Like who would we shoot a missile at? Who'd we shoot at?!
Grob Gob Glob Grod|  I'm thinking, Star Man!
Star Man|  Rooot!
Grob Gob Glob Grod| Grob. Assessment.
Grob Gob Glob Grod| We're sunk, bro. This whole place is gonna be a stinkin' molten dump in a minute.
Grob Gob Glob Grod| It doesn't make sense. Every 1,000 years, the Catalyst Comet mysteriously reincarnates itself and collides with Earth, bringing with it an agent of change. But the comet has never been so off schedule - and it's never freakin' hit Mars!
Grob Gob Glob Grod| What do you think, Finn the Human?
Finn| Wha? Who, me? You can see me too?
Grob Gob Glob Grod| Yes, I am Glob.
Finn|" Oh yeah. Hey, do you ever say ""Oh my Glob?"""
Grob Gob Glob Grod| No, but sometimes Gob does.  You're dreaming so far from home, it must be comet related.
Finn| Yeah, but, I gotta question.
Grob Gob Glob Grod| What's that?
Finn| Well, if just being born is the greatest act of creation.  Then what are you suppose to do after that?  Isn't everything that comes next just sort of a disappointment?  Slowly entropy-ing until we deflate into a pile of mush? 
Grob Gob Glob Grod| Well, it’s not enough to have created something amazing, right? What if I just let my Martian supersociety go to butt?
Finn| But what's it worth if we're all gonna get blowed up right now? 
Star Man| Whoa! What are you doing?!  
Finn| Ahhh!  Oh my bod!
Jake|  What is it, boyi?!
Finn| ...Glob is dead.
Evacuation Man|  Hello, Star Man, this is Evacuation Man, what's the sitch, can we go back yet?
Star Man|  Yes! Gob Glob Grod Grob diverted the comet, it's back on its normal path to Earth.
Evacuation Man| And what about the G-Man?
Star Man| No sign of Glob.
Evacuation Man|  
Martin| Ahh! Computer! What did we hit?!  Oh, blobs...  oh, for real blobs... 
Finn|  Hey, I think Bounce House Princess needs our help.
Jake|  Let's do it!
Jake|  Dude... how long are we gonna follow this frog?
Finn|  I just wanna see 'im put on that crown.
Finn & Jake|   Wooow!
Jake|  It looks cool in there!
Finn|   Too bad we don't have the key to this.
Jake|  What're you talkin' about?  I got two keys right here!
Finn|  Whoo-hoo!
Jake|  Wow! Look at this place!
Finn|  Jake. Are these donuts?
Jake|  They look like donuts.
Finn|  But maybe they're poisonous donuts!  Yeah! Sniff it, Jake! Suck up those toxins!
Jake|  Wait a second... I don't know what poison smells like.
Witch|  Hey!   Razzamafoo!
Jake|  Hey!
Finn|  What gives?!
Witch|  You ate one of my donuts!
Jake|  No, I didn't. I just sniffed it.
Witch|  RAAAAAGH!! You're lying! The stink of magic dog lips is everywhere!
Finn|  Holy slug, lady! Calm down!
Jake|  Listen, Mrs. Witch.
Witch|  I never married!
Jake|  Well, I never ate your donuts.
Witch|  You... you're eating one right now!
Jake|   No, I'm not!  Whoa-hoa! Hm... That's weird... I don't even remember grabbing this. My subconscious must be hungry, huh? Huh... whatever. 
Witch|   MAGICUS NOMORICUS!
Jake|  Uh-oh. 
Finn|  AAH!  Dude, are you okay?
Jake|  Yeah... I think so. Just a little chilly.  WHOA!
Witch|  Ahahahahahehehe!
Finn|  What did she do to you?
Witch|  I stripped him of his magical powers!
Finn|  For stealing one of your billions of donuts?!
Jake|  Yeah, it's not like I killed your husband or somethin'.
Witch|   I AM NOT MARRIED!
Finn|  The point is you overreacted.
Jake|  And what gives?  I used to have like eight more of these things.
Witch|  The only way I'll give back your powers is if you admit your error and say you're sorry and mean it! ...'Cause I can tell the difference.
Jake|  Well, you can forget it because you're the one who's wrong!  ...Right?
Finn|  Total support, dude.
Witch|   RRRRAAAARRGH!!  Go-backicus-from-whence-you-came-icus!
Finn|  Aw, now you're just makin' these up!
Witch|   Are you alright, my... my donut pretties? Heh heh... Wait a second. YOU'RE A BAGEL! LIARS! LIARS EVERYWHERE! 
Finn|  There's gotta be a way to get your powers back! Where'd they come from, anyway? Were you born with them? Or... did you have a freak industrial accident?!
Jake|  Ha. That takes me back. Let me just...  remember.  I see a memory. When I was just a pupster... I'm rollin' around in a mud puddle, and I'm just... lovin's it. Oh, no!  Whoo... Remembering is hard work.
Finn|  What happened next?!
Jake|  Oh. Um... I went into the mud, and... I guess I became a magic dog?
Finn|  Okay! Then our course is clear! We'll roll you in every mud puddle in Ooo until we find the one that'll restore your powers.
Jake|   That's nuts, man. You got any idea of how many mud puddles are in the land of Ooo? Four? Maybe even five?
Finn|  Jake, come on! We've always been lucky, buddy! Maybe the first mud puddle we find will be the right one!
Jake|  Nonsense... but I like it!
Finn|   Then away! Hyuh! Whoo-hoo!
Jake|  Yeah, let's do it!
Finn|  Oh, my gosh!
Jake|  I forgot that I don't have magic powers anymore. How do we search for the mud without my powers?
Finn|  We run! Run like energetic little boys! 
Jake|   This whole time, I thought running was some sort of... leg magic.  Huh... Look at me. I'm runnin'!  Oh, no...   Running... is... evil...
Finn|  Come on, lazy bones!
Jake|  It's too hard!
Finn|  I guess you could ride on my backpack.
Jake|   I can't reach.  You good, Finn?
Finn|   You're... strangling me... a little, is all.
Finn|  Look there! Across the River of Junk! There's an ideal mud puddle.
Jake|  I'll stretch into a boat!  I'm startin' to really miss that old magic of mine.
Finn|  We can swim this river easy!  Come on, Jake! 
Jake|   Man, that looks exhausting.
Jake's subconscious| You're right, Jake. It is exhausting.
Jake|   What are you?!
Jake's subconscious|  I'm your subconscious!
Jake|  Okay, what are you doing here?
Jake's subconscious|  I'm here to tell you that what you're feeling deep down inside is true! It is way too hard to swim across the river. It's easier to wear a hat.  Here! Have a hat!
Jake|   Ha ha!
Jake & his subconscious|  Yeah-hea-hea-hea! Heh heh!
Jake|  Man, I'm glad I met you.
Finn|  Jake! Stop talking to yourself! Cross over already!
Jake|  Uh, I can't swim that river, dude. My subconscious says it's too hard. Check out this hat, though.
Finn|   What's wrong with that guy?  Then just wait for me there!
Jake|  Whatcha workin' on, Finn?  Look at you! Doin' stuff!  Oh, is it a chair?  A chair for my butt—?  Mud-venture!
Finn|  Did it work?!
Jake|  Oh, yeah! I can feel this workin'! In fact, you should roll in the mud with me, Finn! We can both be magic!
Finn|  YEAAAAH!  This isn't working at all.
Jake|  This isn't the right mud. I was just really hopin' this was over and done.
Finn|   Okay... Then let's just go find another mud puddle.
Jake|  Actually... I'm feeling kinda chubby-tired. Can't we do this tomorrow?
Finn|  Agh! This is stupid! Just go back to the witch and apologize and get your powers back!
Jake|  Never! I'd rather be powerless forever then apologize! I'm lazy but prideful.
Finn|   YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING, MAN!  First, you won't run,  a-and now you keep—and... a-and no matter what, I ju—you...
Jake|  Adventuring is too much hard work for a bro without his powers.
Finn|  But you are an adventurer.
Jake|  Nah, from now on, I'm just your regular old dog. ...Ironic given my current man-baby body.
Gary|  Behold the beautiful mermaid of the river.  Which one of you mortals wants to mate with  all this? Heh heh heh...
Finn|"  Oh, um... How do I say, ""You're the grossest thing ever,"" without offending you?"
Gary|  RAAAAAARGH!!
Jake|  I'll scare her off, Finn! 
Finn|  How do we beat power like that?!
Jake|  Finn! I've got an idea!
Finn|  What is it, buddy??
Jake|  Rub my belly! Yeah, I'm one of those kinda dogs.
Finn|   YAAAAH!
Jake|  Finn?  Finn! Come on, Finn! You gotta save yourself! I'm just a dog! Aw, man. Oh, geez... Okay. Then I'm back on the team!  I'll save you!
Finn|  Jake? 
Jake|  Don't worry!  Hey, Finn... Can you help me to get up there?
Hatchlings|  Hungry! Hungry! Hungry!
Jake|   If only I had my powers back!
Witch|  The only way I'll give back your powers is if—
Jake|  I know, I know! I have to apologize to that Witch.
Witch|   Oh, you're doing so well... and I hate you so much!!
Jake|   Hey!  Witch! I need my powers back! So I'm sorry! I'm so sorry I ate your donut!
Witch|  Razzamafoo.
Jake|   ...Oh.  So do I get my powers back?!
Witch|  Mmm... Apology denied.
Jake|  What?! Why?!
Witch|  Because you took too long. Now you have to apologize while doing a variety of humiliating things.
Jake|  No way, Jose!
Jake's subconscious|  Come on, dude. It's the only way to save Finn.
Witch|  Who is that?!
Jake|  He's my subconscious.
Witch|  Then he has to do it too.
Jake's subconscious|  Aw...
Jake|  I, Jake the dog, while slow-dancing with my subconscious, with flowers in my underwear, do humbly apologize...
Witch|   Wait, wait. Start over.
Jake|  You're recording this?!
Witch|  It's for my newsletter.
Jake|  No way. I have my dignity.
Witch|  Then guess what, cool guy? You can forget about getting your powers back... EVER!!
Jake|   Oh, no, dude! What do we do now?
Jake's subconscious|  I'm dyin', Jake.
Jake|  Wha?!
Witch|  Hm. He says he's dying. Let that be a lesson to all you cupcakes.  Hah...
Jake|  Why are you dying, bro?
Jake's subconscious|  Because... I'm the subconscious of your old magical self.  Goodbye, Jake...
Jake|  No! No! 
Witch|  So I've finally broken you.
Jake|  Yeah!  If only... I were a humbler guy, my subconscious would be alive, and my best bud wouldn't be trapped in a mermaid's nest!
Witch|  YES! GLOAT, GLOAT, GLOAT! Alright, I think you've learned your lesson.  I forgive you.
Jake|   My powers! How can I ever thank—  Ha! Got your cane!
Witch|  WHAAA! OOF!   But didn't you learn your lesson?!?
Jake|  NOPE!!! 
Hatchlings|  Hungry! Hungry!
Gary|  Remember to save the brain for dessert.
Jake|  Honey, I'm back! How about a big kiss?   You guys are so cute! I could just maul you to death!
Finn|  Jake!  I never should have doubted you!
Jake|  Well, I'm glad you learned your lesson that in a crunch, there's nothin' I wouldn't do for ya.
Finn|  Ahhh, so is that how you got your powers back? You apologized to the witch?
Jake|  Uh...  No way! I must have found the right... mud puddle! Yeah... I don't remember. Heh... eh-heh... 
Finn|  Jake, why didn't you stick to the plan?
Jake|  Psshh. Hey, you wanna bump baby lumps?
Finn|  Sick. No. Just try to follow the plans, okay?
Jake|  Yeah.
Finn|  Come on out, cuties. It's safe now.
Jake|  Now get out of here. 
Finn|  Hey, you hear something? Up there.  It's a fat, fat warrior beat. It's all...   It calls me forth. 
Jake|  Eh, it's probably just puberty calling.
Fight King|  Fighters! Fighters!  Seek you glory from the Fight King?
Finn|  Mmmm... Maybe.
Fight King|  Then step forth beyond the Moonlight seal to bathe in blood and glory forever.
Finn|  Nah. This is a trap.
Jake|  Ka-psshh.   We snuffed out that trap like champs! Trying to get us up in that cursed arena.
Finn|  Then I'd bet the exits would all magically seal behind us.
Jake|  We'd probably have to fight Gladiator Ghosts.
Finn|  Yeah. That sounds... so dumb... and FLIPPING AWESOME!
Jake|  We're back!
Fight King|  Fools! All exits are sealed!  Now you must fight my Gladiator Ghosts!
Finn|  Yeah. Okay.
Finn|   I'mma beat you with your own thing. Give it up!  Hah-hah!  Ooomph!
Primo|  Hyperion, I'm sorry!
Primo|  Hyperion, my love!
Hyperion|  I'll kill you for breaking your promise!
Finn|  Yeah. Ah-ha-ha-ha.
Fight King|  Good... Take these branches of palm.
Finn|  Yeah.
Jake|  That prize kinda stinks. Let's go, Finn. My thighs hurt.  
Finn|  Aw, man. Okay, it was fun. I'm keeping the branch. 
Fight King|  Where do you think you're going?  You must earn thy freedom by defeating each of my ghosts! When you are ready, speak the Fight King's name, and I shall raise you for... battle.
Finn|  Hmm. Okay, I have a plan. We'll do what the Fight King says, and defeat his ghosts to earn our freedom.  You're gonna follow my plan, right?
Jake|  Mmm-hmm. But, hey, if you replace me with a dummy, I could stay down here and dig for lava. Then I'd forge a molten hula-hoop.
Finn|  That's an entirely different plan... than my plan. What's the hula-hoop for?
Jake| Morale, dude, This tomb will be as fun...  ♪ As a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island, as a tropical island. ♪
Jake|  Check it out, dude.  Ba-duh-buh-da. It's a dirt dummy Jake. Just like in the plan.
Finn|   We're ready... I guess, Fight King.
Fight King|  Gladitoria continues for you, human, and, er... dog?
Finn|  Yup. This is dog.
Fight King|  Arise, Priscus, Verus!
Verus|   Forgive me, Priscus! 
Fight King|  Pity. The dog falls.
Priscus|  Et tu, Verus?
Finn|  Heh.
Fight King|  The combat endeth. Now come closer, champion.
Jake|  Dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig-dig. Two gongs? Something crazy's going on up there.  It's me, Jake. Been here the whole time. Huh?
Fight King|  Come closer, my champion. You have proven worthy of my favor.
Finn|  Hah. Word.
Jake|  Oh, this is bad.
Fight King|  Accept your prize. 
Jake|  Finn?
Fight King|  Ah... The dog lives.
Jake|  Yeah. I lives. Finn, come with me, man.  Whoa! Dude?
Finn|  Sorry, man. But you crossed my kill zone.
Fight King|  Fighters, rest now. 
Jake|  So, how's your side of the plan going?
Finn|  Plan? What plan?
Jake|  To escape. I dig and stuff, and you fight to win, 'member?
Finn|  Yeah. I fight. To hear bones breaking and meat tearing.
Jake|  Ghosts don't got meat.
Finn|  I fight... to FIGHT! 
Jake|   Hmm... Finn's acting weird. Probably due to a decrease in morale. Gotta get him that lava hula-hoop.
Finn|  We're ready for our next fight, Fight King.
Jake|  Gotta liven up this unhallowed ground.... for Finn.  ♪ On a tropical island, underneath a molten lava moon. Hanging with the hula dancers, asking questions 'cause they got all the answers... ♪
Finn|  Habet! Habet! Habet! Heh-heh-heh. 
Achillea|  Amazonia, I'm sorry! 
Finn|  This next take-down is for you, my king! Rahhh...  Heh-heh-heh.
Triumphus|  I need your forgiveness... 
Jake|  ♪ Puttin' on lotion, sittin' by the ocean, rubbin' it on my body, rubbing it on my body... ♪
Rutuba|  Non pugnent, Flamma! 
Finn|  Eludere!
Rutuba|  Cum missione, my friend! 
Finn|  Hoc habet! Whaaa! 
Amazonia|  Achillea...
Finn|  I have defeated every gladiator.
Fight King|  No, for there is one more opponent.
Finn|  Who?
Fight King|  Your dear companion! 
Finn|   
Jake|  ♪ Get me out of this caa-a-ve, 'cause it's nothing but a gladiator graa-a-ve. And if I stick to the plaa-a-n, I think I'll turn into a lava maa-a-n. I think I'll turn into a lava man! ♪ 
Fight King|  Why do you stop?
Finn|  Fight King, this Jake was a farce. Let me face the real Jake!
Fight King|  Then this is round two, my vassal! Take his head for me!
Finn|  Yes, my king. 
Jake|  What about the plan?
Finn|  This is the plan, Jake! Raah! 
Jake|  You're gonna kill me?
Finn|   That's right! Everything has been building to this! The final battle! Brother against brother! TO THE DEATH!
Jake|  No!
Fight King|  Yes...
Fight King|  Yes...
Finn|   Fight King!!! I can't do it.  I can't kill him, Fight King. I can't kill my best friend.
Jake|  Finn?
Finn|  Not without a BIGGER SWORD!
Fight King|  Yes... FINISH HIM!!!
Jake|  No!
Fight King|  Aaarghh... 
Finn|  Wink. 
Jake|  What?  Dude, did you...? Was that all fake? Did you act all that out? Was that part of your plan?
Finn|  Mmm-hmm. 
Jake|  So you planned to get all cozy with the Fight King and almost kill me from the get-go?
Finn|  Pretty much.
Jake|  Why didn't you say so?
Finn|  Because you always bungle my plans. But, if you had bungled this one...  I might have, for real, chopped your head off.
Jake|  That's some funky junk, brother.
Finn|  Hey, Jake, you notice how all these ghosts are walking in pairs?
Jake|  Oh, yeah. I bet they're like us. Best bros who got trapped in that arena.
Finn|  But now they're free!
Sweet P|  
Tree Trunks|  Hold on, Sweet Pig Trunks. We're coming. 
Sweet P|  
Tree Trunks|  There, there, Sweet P, it was just a dream.  
Sweet P|  Just a dream. 
Mr. Pig|  That's my brave little boy. Now you better get dressed; today's your first day of school!
Sweet P|  
Tree Trunks|  Now eat up. 
Sweet P|  Yum!
Mr. Pig|  That's fuel you're gonna need later to soak up allll the education!
Sweet P|   Yesh, dahd! 
Tree Trunks|   Okay, there's your lunch and an apple for the teacher. 
Tree Trunks|  Golly, it's awful nice of y'all to take Sweet P to school on his first day.
Finn|   Our pleas', T.T.!
Jake|  Yeah, first day of school can be real tough. We wouldn't want Sweet P freaking out or awakening any latent evil spirits within himself! 
Mr. Pig|  Well, we're gonna miss you, son. 
Jake|"   You think he's still secretly evil, that he's still all ""Lich-y"" in there?"
Finn|  Mm, not sure.
Jake|  I don't know, Finn, he just seems so... sweet! 
Finn|   Mm.
Mr. Pig & Tree Trunks|   Bye!
Sweet P|  Bye!
Mr. Pig & Tree Trunks|  
Jake|   So far so good. 
Finn|  Fat squirrel in trub! Gah!  Oh, no! 
Jake|  Wait, Finn. Let's just see how this plays out.
Sweet P|  
Jake|  Daww!
Finn|  Hmm...
Finn|  Alright, welp, see you later, Sweet P! 
Jake|  Bye. 
Sweet P|  Bye, Teddy-Man.  
Kid 1|  Hey, Baby-Man! Did your grandma knit your clothes?
Sweet P|  Yeah, and she's my mom! 
Kid 1|  Why are you laughing, Baby-Man? You're not even a real kid!
Sweet P|  Huh?!
Kid 1|  You're nothing but a big, weird baby-man!   Baby-Man!
Sweet P|  
King of Ooo|  Let's see what we got here. Hello there. Intimidated by those bullies, eh?
Sweet P|  Uh, yeah.
King of Ooo|  What's your name, kid?
Sweet P|  Sweet P!
King of Ooo|  I'm the one true King of Ooo. This is my attorney, Toronto. Sweet P, there are all kinds of education, you know.
Sweet P|  No?
King of Ooo|  Yes, sir, all kinds! Such as... dancing. You could blow off this podunk school and get a proper dance education! Then you can come back and really show those mean kids and make your parents proud!
Toronto|  Hey, King of Ooo!
King of Ooo|  Yes, Toronto?
Toronto|  You are a certified dance instructor, right? Show the kid the dance you do.
King of Ooo|  Nooo, that dance is too tough for an amateur!
Toronto|  Aw, come on. You gotta show the kid. It's awesome!
King of Ooo|  Yeah, I know it's awesome, but I really don't think the kid is ready.
Toronto|  Ready?
King of Ooo|  I don't think he's tough enough to be ready.
Sweet P|  I'm tough enough to be ready!
Toronto|  See?! The kid is tough... and ready!
Sweet P|   Please?! 
King of Ooo|  Aah, I do see it!
Sweet P|   Eee!
King of Ooo|  You've got a good eye, and you're a good dog!  Watch this, kid. 
Sweet P|  Ahh! 
King of Ooo|  Well, we got us a prodigy here. You're ready for advanced classes.  Hey, you mugs, wanna see some world-class dancing? Just turn around!
Candy Person 1|  Ah, leave me alone!
Candy Person 2|  Leave me alone, too.
Candy Person 3|  I'm turning around! 
Toronto|  Teeth! 
King of Ooo|   Ha, ya did great!
Toronto|  You should come back tomorrow, kid, for more dancin' lessons!
King of Ooo|  Have a gold star!  Show that to your parents, kid. They'll love it! But... don't tell 'em where you got it, or you'll ruin the surprise. Just think how proud they'll be at your big, uhh, end-of-the-year recital! You understand?
Toronto|  Of course Sweet P understands; he's a good boy!
Sweet P|  A good boy! 
Mr. Pig|  So, how was school?
Tree Trunks|  Yes, how'd ya do?  A gold star?!
Mr. Pig|  I'm gonna put this where we can see it every day.  Thumbs up!
Tree Trunks|  Thumbs up! Come on, thumbs up! 
Sweet P|  Thumbs up! 
King of Ooo|  Thumbs up!
Toronto|  Thumbs up!
King of Ooo|  Well, this is our place.
Toronto| We'd invite you in, but the place is a mess.
King of Ooo|  He's right; we're filthy. Listen, we all need a break. Go on home, kid, and we'll see you tomorrow!
Sweet P|  Mm!
Tree Trunks|  Sweet P, uh, we're going on a date. You're smart and educated enough to stay at home all by yourself.
Mr. Pig|  The proof is on the fridge! 
Sweet P|  Mama and Papa will be so surprised if the refrigerator is all covered with stars when they get back. One more star should do it. I need to find King of Ooo and Toronto to get me that last star.
Toronto|  I don't know, K.O, they've gone rancid.
King of Ooo|  Horse feathers! A lick of gold paint is all it needs!  Just a couple more garbage stars, eh, Toronto?
Toronto|  Mo' stars means mo' dosh!
King of Ooo|  Soon we'll have enough scratch to fund my big comeback! This kid is great at helping us rob people!
Toronto|  And best of all, he doesn't know a thing! Because if he did...
King of Ooo & Toronto|  We'd have to take care of him!  
Toronto|  What was that?! 
King of Ooo|  Sweet P? What did you hear?
Toronto|  What does it matter?! None of it was good!
King of Ooo|  We gotta take care of him.
Sweet P|  Aaa! 
King of Ooo|  I shouldn't have said that out loud.
Sweet P|   Mom, Dad! 
King of Ooo|"  Hey, kid! Toronto and I talked it over, and we decided that we're not going to  ""Take care of you."""
Toronto|  We're going to burn down your orchard! 
Sweet P|   Nooo!
King of Ooo|  Yup, we're gonna burn it down—unless...
Sweet P|  Unless?
King of Ooo|  You leave home and your loving parents and come dance with us forever.
Toronto|  Forever!
Sweet P|  No! No, no, no, no, no! 
King of Ooo|  Come on, Sweet P. The people love you!
Sweet P|  They do?
King of Ooo|  Well, mostly they love to laugh at you. I mean, look at yourself. You're a— a— a big, weird baby-man! 
Toronto|  Baby-Man, Baby-Man 
Sweet P|   Stop. 
Lich/Sweet P|  I have learned much from you. Thank you, my teachers. And now for your... education. 
Lich|  Before there was time, before there was anything, there was nothing, and before there was nothing... there were monsters.  Here's your gold star! 
Sweet P|  Mr. King of Ooo? 
King of Ooo & Toronto|  Monster! Monster! Waaaaah!! 
Sweet P|   Just a dream!
Tree Trunks & Mr. Pig|  Morning, son - Sweet P!
Sweet P|   Surprise!
Tree Trunks|  Oh, my, my, where did you get all this bling?
Sweet P|   Uhh, my teachers!
Tree Trunks|  Wow, how nice of those teachers!
Sweet P|  Mm-hmm! 
Kid 1|  Hey, Baby-Man, guess who we are! 
Sweet P|    
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay. I'm going to lower the screen. Tell me what you see.
Finn|  Crunchy, you look like a rainbow! It's beautiful! Can you guys see that?
Princess Bubblegum|  Nope. Only you can see it because you're hooked up to the aura visualizer. But actually I'm lying. We can see everything you see on this screen. Now I'm gonna send that image into Crunchy.
Crunchy|  Whoa!
Finn|  The aura's gone!
Princess Bubblegum|  Except...  Crunchy's true essence manifested in the material plane!
Finn|  I wanna see Peppermint Butler's aura!
Peppermint Butler|   You don't wanna see that!
Finn|  Yeah, we do! Right, Princess?
Princess Bubblegum|  Sure, Finn! Just let me re-calibrate the device!
Jake|  No! Bunk that, I'm tired! C'mon, Finn!
Finn|  Oh, yeah. Yeah, me and Jake, we gotta peace out.
Finn & Jake|  G'night!
Finn|  Hey- what's goin' on in here? Yo, guys!
Banana Guards|  Hey, Finn!
Finn|  Whoa, what's that? Security cams?
Banana Guard 1|  Yeah, man! You gotta see some crazy stuff—
Banana Guard 2|  Yo, shut up!
Banana Guard 1|  Oh, shoot...
Finn & Jake|  What?
Banana Guard 2|  Nothin'!
Finn & Jake|  What is it?
Banana Guards|  Nothing!
Finn & Jake|  Show us now!
Banana Guards|  Show you what?
Finn & Jake|  What you said!
Banana Guards|  We didn't say nothin'!
Finn & Jake|  Too late for take-backs! We practically know everything already! Now show us!
Banana Guard 1|  Okay, but you can't tell anyone.
Banana Guard 2|  Yeah, this is our weird secret.
Jake|  Of course, dude!
Banana Guard 1|  All right. Now look at monitor three. Can you see it?
Finn|  Oh, yeah! That's, uh... Who is that?
Jake|  That's Chocoberry. Why are you guys spyin' on Chocoberry?
Banana Guard 2|  No, man! Look there, in the corner!
Finn|  Who's that?
Banana Guard 1|  Zoom in, dude!
Banana Guard 2|  Plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus, plus...
Finn|  WAAAAAAAAAAAAUH! Lemongrab! What the—?
Banana Guard 1|  This is our weird secret, okay? Remember that!
Princess Bubblegum|  How long has this been going on?
Banana Guard 1|  He's shown up every night for the past two weeks!
Banana Guard 2|  He goes to different rooms and just stands there!
Princess Bubblegum|  And you didn't tell me?!
Banana Guard 1|  If we told you, then we knew you'd mess up our weird TV show!
Banana Guard 2|  Banana guarding is boring!
Princess Bubblegum|  I'm gonna talk to him.
Banana Guard 1|  Oh, no! Ya see?!
Princess Bubblegum|  Sorry, guys!
Princess Bubblegum|  Lemongrab! 
Earl of Lemongrab|  NNYUGH! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Why are you stalking my peeps?!
Earl of Lemongrab|  I AM WITHIN MY RIGHTS!

Earl of Lemongrab|  ...Uh... I AM THE EARL...

Candy People|  No, no, we won't go! No, no, we won't go! No, no...
Princess Bubblegum|  Please, please! All I need is three healthy volunteers to move in with Lemongrab! He's all by himself with no one to govern!
Candy People|  No, no, we won't go! No, no we won't go!
Princess Bubblegum|  Come on, Mr. Cupcake! Just for a little while?
Mr. Cupcake|  UUGH!  I can't, Princess! My arm is broken!
Finn|  Dude! You didn't have to do that...
Princess Bubblegum|  Alright! What's it gonna take, people?!
Jamaica|  Two things, Princess! Yeah, that's right! Back up, fools!
Princess Bubblegum|  You got nerve showing your faces here, notorious Pup Gang!

Jamaica|  We only did that 'cuz you're old!
Jake|  You sacks! I'll rip your cups!
Princess Bubblegum|  Jake, please! What is your second demand?
Toughy|  We want the big cash money wad! Enough to provide for our delinquent mothers, so that hopefully they'll show us the love we always dreamed about in our sad, young lives!
Jake|  Hmm.
Princess Bubblegum|  I grant you the big cash money wad! Now off with you, to Castle Lemongrab!
Toughy|  Yo, Lemongrease! We're gonna live here at Lemongrab now!
Earl of Lemongrab|  Yes.
Jamaica|  I'm Jamaica, and this is Toughy, and Blombo! 
Earl of Lemongrab|  Blombo, what is that?
Jamaica|  What?
Earl of Lemongrab|  On Blombo's ears...
Jamaica|  That's his headphones!
Earl of Lemongrab|  BLOMBO! Take them off! Blombo, you must heed my INSTRUCTIONS! TAKE OFF YOUR THIIINGS!!!
Toughy|  Whoa! Settle down, Lemongrease!
Earl of Lemongrab|  I-I-I AM NOT GREASE! THIS IS UNACCEPTABUUUUUUUUUUUUU—
Blombo|   What? What's goin' on?
Earl of Lemongrab|  All unfit citizens of Lemongrab must be RECONDITIONED!

Princess Bubblegum|  Maybe... Let's keep looking.  Awww, geez!  Hey!
Earl of Lemongrab|   Nhuh?
Princess Bubblegum|  What happened to your new citizens?
Earl of Lemongrab|   They didn't understand my lemon stylez. I like this way better.
Princess Bubblegum|  Hmmm... I wonder if you don't understand their candy stylez! C'mon, lemme show you something!
Princess Bubblegum|  You see, Earl, candy people are mad special.  They need constant stroking, and snuggling...
Earl of Lemongrab|  
Princess Bubblegum|  Ah!  Here. You try.

Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, dear! His Candy Citizens!
Finn|  Let's crush this mess all accordingly!
Jake|  Crazy lightbulb hardcore style!
Finn|  Yeah!
Princess Bubblegum|  No. He's my responsibility. I have to try to help him!
Finn|  Okay, that's cool, too.
Jake|  Hop on!
Princess Bubblegum, Jake, and Finn|  Lemongrab? Lemongrab!
Jake|  No Lemongrab.
Finn|  C'mon! Let's find the Pup Gang quick!
Princess Bubblegum|  Wait. I have a plan. You guys go on ahead.
Finn|  Okay, cool!
Finn|  What do you got, Jake?
Jake|  Just an empty room with a catcher's mitt!
Finn|  ...Weird.
Finn & Jake|   Oh, no! 
Earl of Lemongrab|  This is serious! Pup Gang got four units... Maaaybe... Maybe ten units for trespassers?  YOU GOT TRICKS, HUH?! YOU GOTTA FALL DOWN SOMETIME! AND WHEN YOU DO, TWELVE UNITS!

Lemongrab clone|  I'm Lemongrab!
Earl of Lemongrab|  O-oh!
Princess Bubblegum|  I made him for you, in your pantry. For you to be with!

Lemongrab clone|  Yeah!  All in favor of pardoning the prisoners?
Earl of Lemongrab|  Aye!
Lemongrab clone|  PARDONS FOR ALL!
Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum|  Good bye, Lemongrabs! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Take care, boys!
Earl of Lemongrab|  Yes! Yes, indeed! A-ha-ha! A lemon gives by taking...
Lemongrab clone|  ...and cares by YELLING!
Earl of Lemongrab|  Hmm!
Lemongrab clone|  Hmm!
Earl of Lemongrab|  Well, okay! STOP BY ANY TIIIME!!!
Lemongrab clone|  BUT CALL FIRST!!!
Earl of Lemongrab|  YES, GOOD-BYYYE!!!
Finn| Jake. Jake!  Hey man, shouldn't we conserve our energy? The Ice Cream Marathon starts tomorrow.
Jake|  I know what the Ice Cream Marathon is.  I've been training for weeks. And I am determined to eat more ice cream at the Ice Cream Marathon than anyone else!
Finn| You sure like ice cream.
Jake| Ice cream is good!
Jake| What the croak was that?
Finn| It came from over there .
Finn| Whoa, Jake! Check it out!
Finn| It's a brave little Gnome Knight.
Jake| What? That's a frog dressed up like a Gnome Knight.
Frog| Actually, I'm a Gnome Knight who was magically transformed into a frog. And then I decided to continue being a knight.
Jake| And now you're, like, attracting a mate?
Frog| No! I'm on the verge of death!
Jake| Oh. Well, you should just let go, man.
Finn| Yeah, you've had a good run.
Frog| No! I cannot die until I find a being whose spirit is brave and pure to take over my quest.
Finn|  Quest?
Jake| Uh-oh.  Somebody's gonna do a quest for a frog.
Finn| Tell me more about this... quest.
Frog| I have to guard  these magic beans.
Jake| Huh?
Frog| Two of the beans are good, but one is horribly evil! I have no idea which is which. So I've spent my life guarding them, preventing them from ever being planted.
Jake| Beans?! Ah ha ha! Magic beans... hee! We'll be right back. Come on, Finn. I think I dropped my spoon in the bush. 
Finn| We will take your quest.
Frog| You will?
Finn| Sure!  Consider it guarded.
Frog| Also, take this .
Finn|  Oh. Okay. Thanks.
Frog| No, thank you. 
Finn| Whoa!
Jake| Dude, what's goin' on?
Finn| We took over the quest!
Jake| What?! The beans?  Now wait a second!
Gnome Knight| Nope, too late. 
Finn| Ah, I miss him already.
Jake| Well, we should get a move on if we wanna make the Ice Cream Marathon. 
Finn| What about the quest?
Jake|  Really? We have to do the bean quest?
Finn| I gave him my word.
Jake| Yeah, I wasn't here for that, so... can't we guard the beans and eat ice cream?
Finn|" No, man! We're on the job. And like you always say, ""Work and fun don't mix..."""
Jake|" ""...unless you're a clown."" I do say that a lot."
Jake| Gee, sittin' in this hot sun, guarding beans. It sure beats 26 miles of vanilla ice cream. Or caramel ice cream. Or peach ice cream. Hey, what if we plant the beans ourselves?
Finn| That's a terrible idea.
Jake| No, wait, hear me out. See,  if one of these beans is evil, then it's our duty to crush it, once and for all! Plus, two of the beans are good. If we plant them, we'll be bringin' twice as much good into the world!
Finn| And we can make it to the Ice Cream Marathon!
Jake| I hadn't even thought about that!
Jake|  I'm gonna take a cat nap.
Finn| What? But we have to be ready for evil!
Jake|  If we take shifts, there's less chance of us falling asleep at the same time. 
Finn|  Alright Finn, Jake's a lazy bum and this soil is ripe with evil. I cannot go to sleep until that evil bean sprouts and is destroyed.
Finn| AAAH!  Wake up, Jake! This is it!
Jake|  Huh?  Oh!
Finn| Aah! Bean pod!  I can't tell if it's evil yet.
Finn| Huh? Baby Pigs dressed in silly costumes?
Jake| Aw, look how cute they look all sleepy and snore-y.
Finn| Careful, Jake. It could be a trap. We should test them to see if they're... evil.
Finn| Okay. Each one of you take one test and one pencil. You have one hour to complete the test and prove we shouldn't kill you.  And begin.
Jake| Aw, they're so cute they can hardly hold their pencils.
Finn| That doesn't fare well for their...  grade point average.
Jake| Nothing evil could be this adorable.
Finn|"  Hmm, you might be right.  The only thing on here is a cute drawing of an ice cream cone under ""Do you have allergies?"" Yeah,  nothing evil. Okay, the pigs are good."
Jake| YES!  You hear that, guys? You passed! A-plus! A-plus-plus!
Finn| Oh, no!  Jake, get ready. The second pod is about to drop. PROTECT THE PIGLETS!
Jake|  Stay back, babies!
Finn| Show me what you have to offer, pod!
Finn| Magical wands?
Jake| What? COOL! 
Finn| Stop, Jake!
Jake|  WOW!
Finn| Is it evil?
Jake| It's a wand that poops glitter! What's good-er than that?!  Whee-hee-hee-hee-hee! 
Finn| Hmm...  Hahahaha! Glitter on its own could be evil. But with rainbows? Over my dead body!
Jake| Hey, let's have some fun with these pigs before the evil pod shows up!
Finn| Yeah!
Finn| Phew!
Jake| I'm exhausted!
Finn| They look so sleepy and peaceful. We have to stay alert. The evil pod could appear at any time. When it does, we must be ready to destroy it immediately.
Jake| And then go to the Ice Cream Marathon, right?
Finn|  Yeah, man.
Jake|  Okay. I'll take the first shift.
Finn|  Rhombus.
Finn| AH! Look! The third pod!
Jake| It's bigger than the other two, dude!
Finn|  Yeah, man. We've gotta kill it now.
Jake| Huh?  It's squirting!
Finn| Squirting?! 
Jake| See? Squirting. Right here.  Tastes good. 
Finn| Dang, man! Don't just lick stuff! It's evil!
Jake|  No, it's not. It's... ice cream! 
Finn| Is the evil sucking you in?  JAKE! 
Jake|  That was awesome.
Finn| Are you poisoned?! Are you dying?
Jake| No, man! It was awesome!
Finn| Look, Jake! It's filling back up!
Jake|" Aw, yeah!  This pod makes ice cream out of nothing! It's the ""goodest"" thing that's ever happened to me!"
Finn| Well, if this pod's not evil....  The piglets are gone!
Jake| And so are the fairy wands.
Finn|  Let's go! The screaming sounds are getting stronger near Mushroom Town!
Finn| Piglets! Stop this!
Finn and Jake| Oof!
Finn|" Cram! Now I must find these wicked piglets' weakness and use it to ""retribuse"" them."
Jake| Well, I found my weakness .
Finn| That's it! Ice cream!
Jake|  What about ice cream?
Finn|  Yes... yes! HA! The exams confirm my memory of the piglets being allergic to ice cream.
Jake| Just the thought of that scares me, man.
Finn| I see one of them! Get ready to release! RELEASE!
Jake| Ah, gross! That's--EW!
Finn|  Ah, gross man!
Finn| JAKE! Jake!  Jake, are you okay?
Jake|  Ahh, I can't stop dancing!
Finn| Wha--?
Jake| It must be the glitter! Oh, I really can't stop groovin'! It feels weird! Go on without me!
Finn|  YAAAAAAAAAH!
Finn|" ""Freezed"" to meet you!"
Finn| Hope you saved room for dessert!
Finn| Killing you with ice cream!
Jake|  Whoo! Yeah, man!
Finn| Whoa!  Jake! There's one left... and I think he's trying to surrender.
Jake| Kill it!
Finn| But he's dressed as a little construction worker! It's freakin' adorable.
Jake|  He's tryin' to trick you! Kill it!
Finn| I just don't know if I can bring myself to do it, Jake.
Mushroom Mayor| Why, thank you, Finn and Jake, for sort of saving our village.
Finn| You're sort of welcome.
Mushroom Mayor| Now if you'll excuse us, we need to start removing all of this ice cream from our homes and businesses.
Jake| Not so fast! I'll take it from here, folks. 
Finn|  He likes ice cream.
Finn| Haha, nice job, tubby. But save room for the Ice Cream Marathon.
Jake|  I've always got room for ice cream, Finn. You know that, man! Ugh, I'm going to the Ice Cream Marathon.
Finn|  He just really likes ice cream.
Mushroom Mayor| Oh.
Jake|  Ha-ha-ha. Okay, now make him look angrier!
Finn|  Alright, give me a second.
Jake|  Nope, not funny anymore. Sorry, dude—you ruined it.
Finn|  Man, I don't have patience for this animation junk. Whoever does this must have no life whatsoev—
Finn|  Oof... Why did I do that?
Jake|  Yo Finn, did you order a brick?
Finn|  Hm, I don't think so.
Jake|   False alarm; it's just an email.
Finn|  Who's it from?
Jake|  Looks like Ice King's handwriting.
Finn and Jake|  Eeeww!
Finn|  Escape, Jake! Escape!
Jake|  Alright, alright, hold on.  Oh man! Thing must've had a computer worm in it!
Finn|  Whaa? Aaaah!
Ice King|  Hey, Princess!
Princess Bubblegum|  What now, Ice King?
Ice King|  Remember that time last summer when you said you'd only go out on a date with me if I was the last guy on Ooo?
Princess Bubblegum|  I doubt I said that.
Finn and Jake|  P-bubs! P-bubs, P-bubs!
Finn|  The computer went...
Jake|  Open video and...
Finn|  The email...
Jake|  Potato trampoline...
Finn|  Brick window with the plastic...
Jake|  Then crashment!
Finn|  Banana hummingbird...
Jake|  47 grapes!
Ice King|   Anyone having any...  computer problems? 
Finn|  How do we stop the computer worm, you pile of goo?!
Ice King|  E-ha-ha-ha-ha! My worm exists beyond your comprehension within the universal source code...
Finn|  STOP TALKING LIKE A NERD AND GIVE IT TO US STRAIGHT!!!
Ice King|"  Once the glitch does its work, the whole world will be deleted! Except for me and my ""Bubblygums.""  Ow!! Well, see y'all! I'm gonna prepare for my... date. Ahaha! "
Donut Guy|   AAAAAHH! MY BEAUTIFUL FACE!! MY HOPES AND DREAMS—RUINED!!! 
Finn|  Don't worry, Princess, we'll take care of this thing.
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, me too.  I'm gonna take care of it, too. 
Finn|  Okay! 
Finn|   Don't worry, guy! I got you!  YEOW! JAKE, HELP ME!!!
Jake|   Okay, shh, you're safe! 
Finn|  Come here, guy!
Sugar Cube|  No... Stay away from me!
Finn|  I'm trying to help you, yo!
Sugar Cube|  I saw what happened when you picked up Todd. 
Finn|  But... No!! Jake, this isn't working! We need a plan.
Jake|  Aw, man. Okay, here is my dream plan. You were wearin' tights made of green feathers. These tiny green feathers. And I was this wisecracking coelacanth that only ate popcorn. Anyway, we were in this—
Finn|  THAT PLAN'S NOT GOOD!
Jake|  Hold on, I'm almost done. So we were trapped inside this huge egg, and after a while you started dancing in this kind of sign language. And then Ice King's glitchy stuff started eatin' my dream up. I peed in my pants, but you went up and talked to it. You just... talked to it.
Finn|  Then talk to it I will.  Hey man, tell me the haps.
Jake|  Yeah, tell us your feelings! Get deep.
Jake|"  ""Sllabfoog uoy pleh tnac I..."""
Donut Guy|   OH, SWEET LORD, MY FACE! MY PERFECT...!!
Jake|  Slaw frog yokel snacky. Snacky slaw frog yokel. Sea salt yack let a snacky. Yeah, that sounds good!
Donut Guy|  AAAAAAAAAAH...!!!
Finn|   Jake, I think I found a way in!
Jake|  No, wait, dude. I think I cracked the code!
Finn|  There's no time! 
Jake|  AAAAAAH!!!
Finn|  AAAAH... AAH!!!
Jake|  This must be the universal source code!
Finn|  Huh? Ice King and Bubblegum?
Finn|  Jake! Don't touch anything!
Jake|  Huh?
Finn|  I think the shiny things are the building blocks of the universe, man! They store every single thing that is a thing back on thing!
Jake|  Okay, enough exploring already. Where is this glitch guy? I'm gonna smash his jimmies. 
Finn|  Jake, what is it?
Ice King|  Oh, Princess Bubblegum? Guess who? Can you guess? Can you? I'll give you 3 chances.
Princess Bubblegum|  No.
Ice King|  OK, four chances. 
Princess Bubblegum|   Ice King, give me the anti-virus, or I'll shoot you with my candy horse tranquilizer!
Ice King|  But sugar, look what I brought you! A box of chocos!  Hm... Still good.  Argh. Look, I can't prove it, but...  ...you made a promise we'd have at least one date if...  ...if I was the last person on Ooo...  You promised... 
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, well, even if I did promised, you're not the last person on Ooo, because I'm still here. 
Ice King|  Well, uh... Ooh, I-I have a hand too, y'know? I can lend you one...  Check out my cool hand! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh, that's disgusting.
Ice King|  Grrrr!!!
Finn|  Come on, Jake, pull it together, man.
Finn|  Jake?
Jake|  Oh, no, my arm!  We had so many great times together...
Jake|  Dooby, dooby, dooby, dooby, skeebily, skeebily, dapdy doo...
Jake|  Huh? Who's that?  Awww.
Jake|   Let's do this... for Righty!
Finn|  That's the spirit!  ADVENTURE TI--!!!  Oh, my gams!! Hold up, dude, my body's changing! 
Princess Bubblegum|   ...No. 
Ice King|  Oh, come on, woman, I'm trying to be nice! Can't you at least make the best out of this?  Are you praying to me? I'm into this.  ...I'm still into this.  Still into it.
Princess Bubblegum|   GIVE ME THE ANTI-VIRUS!
Ice King|  I can't, monkey peeps, I didn't make one! The glitch will delete everything until we're all that's last!
Princess Bubblegum|  You mean, forever?!
Ice King|  Well, yeah! I mean, you say that like it's a bad thing.
Princess Bubblegum|  Come on, Finn and Jake....
Jake|  So, hey, Finn, how do you plan on taking this guy out?
Finn|  
Jake|  Okay, I guess it's worth trying.
Jake|  Aah! What we do now?
Finn|  We gotta get those things... outta his stomach.
Jake|  Hey, Finn! Remember that gross video Ice King sent?
Finn|   Ugh, yeah.  Yeah!!
Jake|  Let's double team these locks! 
Finn and Jake|  We did it! 
Jake|  You should wash your hair!
Finn|  You should wash your mouth! 
Ice King|  Huh? No way! Impossible!  Uh...
Jake|  Everything back to normal, huh? 
Finn|  Seems like it. 
Donut Guy|   Aah! My face!! My beautiful face is back to normal!!! Aaah!!!! 
Finn|  Hey, have you seen the princess anywhere?
Donut Guy|  Yes, she's in the Ice King's castle. AUGGH! 
Princess Bubblegum|   Useless--  Ugh! --computer!  You sassa-frassin-- Nu!! --hammer-slammin-- Ruh! --wamma-jammin...  Ugh!  Ugh!  Ah-ya-ya-ya-ya!  Finn and Jake!  My heroes! 
Jake|  Yeah, no big deal. Geez... 
Princess Bubblegum's hand|  I missed you!
Jake's elbow|  I missed you, too!  Whoa, you taste different, baby! You been playin' basketball in someone else's hockey rink?
Finn|  Ahem... Hey, Bubs, where's the Ice King? I wanna kick his boingloings! 
Jake|  Yeah. Where is he? I wanna kick his boingloings, too!
Ice King|  Uh... guys? Hello? Princess. Uh... Let's forget all about this...  Ugh get off of me, you creep! Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!
Finn|   I'm here just in time! 
Finn|   ♪Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa......♪
Jake|   Whoa!
Jake|   Don't let the dragon, drag on, man.
Finn|   Mhm.
Finn|   Thanks!
Randy|  Sign my rock.
Finn|   Okay.
Candy Person #1|   FINN!  HAVE DINNER WITH ME! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! FINN! 
Finn|  Sure, man. Yeah. Sure, sometime.
Candy Person #1|   How about... EVERY NIGHT! THIS WEEK!
Finn|  Well, maybe one night.
Candy Person #1|   C'mon, man! Every night!
Randy|  No, man! You get out of here!
Candy Person #1|   BOOM!
Finn|  Hey, y'all! Don't fight!
Jake|   We should get out of here, Finn. I think someone called the heat.
Candy Person #1|   HAVE DINNER WITH ME! HAVE DINNER! I WANT DINNER! FINN!
Finn|  Sucks!
BMO|   Finn, can't go outside today?
Finn|  I guess I could. I just don't wanna deal with those guys right now.
BMO|  Ooooohhhhhh.... Deal with me!  Let's play,  Cops and Robbers!  Give me your bank account! Bang! Bang!  Reach for the roof and give me all your gold bricks.
Finn|   Ah, okay, okay, don't hurt me!
BMO|  Don't worry, Finn.  It's only me, BMO! I'm wearing  a disguise!
Finn|   Hmm....
BMO|   Your beauty's destroyed!
Finn|  Hot job! BMO, how do I look?
BMO|   Like the devil!
Jake|  Whoa! Intruder! Finn! There's an intruder in here!
Finn|  No!  It's me! It's Finn!  This is my alter-ego.... Davey Johnson!
Jake|  Ohhhhhh.
Finn|  I'll dress up like this so no one bothers me about being Finn.
Jake|  Do you think that'll goin' to do the trick?
Finn|  I dunno! 
Candy Person #1|  Is that Finn?
Finn|  Hello! Ahem, hello, hello, helloo...... ahhhhhHHH   Hello! I'm Davey!
Randy|  Oh, I thought it was Finn on account of he's wearing Finn's exact clothes.
Davey|   Hi! I'm Davey!
Candy Person #15| Ah, so what?
Davey|  You wanna have dinner with me?
Lollipop Girl|  Go away, weirdo.
Davey|  Haha! 
Coco Bird Vender|  Hey! You've gotta pay for those, man. I'm trying to run a business here!
Davey|   I gotta find a job!  I need a job!
Broom Store Owner|  Can you sweep a broom?
Davey|  You betcha! 
Davey|  Jeez louise! Quittin' time already?
Broom Store Owner|  Sure is, Davey.
Davey|  Take 'er easy, boss.
Broom Store Owner|  Goodnight, Davey.
Finn|   Man, today was awesome. Just normal, y'know? Just like a normal day. No drama, or any of that. Just super normal. Man it was great.
Jake|   That's cool. Goodnight, Finn.
Finn|   I'm Davey.
Jake|  Haha! Yeah.
Davey|  I'm Davey! 
Jake|   Hey, Finn, you wanna have dinner instead of breakfast today? Finn?  That must be him. 
Candy Person #1|  I MADE YOU DINNER, FINN! WHERE WERE YOU?!
Jake|   Uhh.... What's going on?
Davey|  Oh, heya, mister, thanks for putting me up last night. I'm just chopping some wood so's I can build a little log cabin to live in.
Randy|   Hey, I'm Randy.
Davey|  Randy, wanna get dinner tonight?
Randy|  Nah, I'm busy. I like to wonder at night.
Jake|  Finn what's going on?
Davey|   You gotta start calling me Davey, mister. Because that's my name!
Davey|   Daaaaaaaaaavvvveeeeeeyyyyyy!!!
Jake|  Oh, no! Have you lost your teacups, man?
Davey|  Mister, I don't know nothing about that. I'm just a working joe... trying to stake my claim... under the sun... and look out on the beautiful green fields called... life!
Jake|  Uhhhhhhhh........
Randy|  Hey, Davey, where do you want these logs?
Davey|  Oh, just attach 'em to the cabin. Like how it should be. So it looks like a cabin. We're gonna build a right wall and front wall. Ummmmm-
Randy|  How about the roof?
Davey|  Maybe, maybe.
Randy|  I've been holding these.
Davey|  They look good.
Randy|  How do you put good looking wood on a cabin?
Jake|  Gotta figure a way to get Finn to act normal. 
BMO|  Pew! Pew! Pew! Pew! Pewwww.....
Jake|  Ah! Give me the wallet! Or feel my claw! The wallet!
BMO|  Watch out! A robber!
Jake|  I'll cut you! I mean, rob you! 
Davey|  Oh, no!
Jake|  I'm a robber and I'm gonna rob this guy's life! And there's nobody who can stop me. Unless there's a hero around here.  Like there's someone here who is actually a hero in disguise. They can probably stop me.  C'mon, Finn. Be a hero.
Randy|  What? What are we talking about?
Jake|  Butt out, Randy!
Randy|   Uhhhhhhhhhhhh.........
Jake|   Yes, Finn. Put on your awesome hat and beat me up.
Randy|  What?
Jake|  I'm not talking to you, Randy!
Davey|   I called the police.
Jake|  Wait, what?
Jake|  Guys, it's not what it looks like! That guy isn't really named Davey. It's Finn! He brainwashed himself to become Davey and I was just trying to inspire him to go back to being Finn.
Banana Guards|  Yeah, yeah. We've heard that before. C'mon robber!
Jake|   Finn, don't let the dragon drag on, man. Don't let the dragon drag on!
Davey|   Don't let the dragon........ Jake!
Randy|   Well that was pretty unusual, wasn't it, Davey?
Davey|  Get outta here Randy!  Geeeet ouuuuut! 
Davey|   No more Davey.
Mustache|  But you love being Davey.
Finn|  I do love being Davey, but being Davey caused Jake to get arrested.
Mustache|  But remember that time when Davey sat in the park and saw some people walking around?
Finn|  Yeah, that was nice.
Mustache|  And remember that time when Davey swept the floors?
Finn|   Yeah, that was great, too. But-
Mustache|  Do you really wanna go back to being a famous hero? Why not just be Davey? A simple man... with simple goals and simple problems. You can just blend in and live the simple life.
Finn|  Yeah.... Blend in. Y'know, maybe I'll be Davey just one more time! 
Davey|  One more time!
Banana Guard #1|  C'mon, man! That last game wasn't fair.
Banana Guard #2|  How about Who can hold up their hand the longest?
Banana Guard #1|  Okay, this game breaks the tie.
Banana Guard #2|  Okay.
Banana Guard #1|  Last game.
Banana Guard #2|  Last game.
Davey|  Hey, fellas. How's tricks?
Banana Guard #2|  Hm? Oh, hey Davey.
Davey|   Ah! Keys! 
Banana Guard #2|  Hm?  What's going on?
Davey|  Ah. Would you care for a body sweep?
Banana Guard #2|  Umm... yeah... sure. I do feel kinda dirty.
Banana Guard #1|  Whew! You sure know how to party, Davey! 
Davey|  
Banana Guard #2|   Yes yes yes!
Banana Guard #1|  No no no!
Davey|  
Jake|  Davey?!
Finn|  No, it's me,  Finn!
Jake|  Finn! 
Banana Guard #2|   Here's your meal, criminal. We feed our criminals.  Hey, stop!
Finn|   Goodbye, Davey.
Mustache|  Goodbye, Finn.
Banana Guard #2|  Hey, there they go!
Banana Guard #1|  Yeah, there goes Davey and the criminal.
Finn|  Good luck catching those guys!
Banana Guard #2|   Thanks!
Jake|   Glad to have you back, buddy.
Finn|  Word.
Jake|  Yo BMO, you done chargin' up that phone or what?
BMO|  Almost... finished... 
Jake|   Thanks, BMO. Alright, man. We're gonna figure this out... right... now! 
Jake|  Yo yo yo yo, check it! This is Jake on my camera phone!  Whooooooooooaaaaaaa. Whoooa! Yo, Finn! Say 'hi' to my new camera phone!
Finn|  Whaddup camera phone!
Finn & Jake|  Marceline! 
Marceline|  You guys wanna come party in the Nightosphere with me? I'm visiting with my dad and it's craaaazy boring.
Finn|  Whoa, wait a minute Marceline. Last time I saw your dad,  I sliced open his soul sack. 
Marceline|  Oh no, he's totally chill now.
Finn|  Okay, but I'm keepin' an eye out for your old man in case he pulls any  sneak attacks.
Marceline|  Don't be a wiener dog. Jake, you coming?
Jake|   Whoo! Yeah, baby!
Jake|  Alright. So, this is the Nightosphere, I guess.  It looks banay-nays.  Marceline says they got tons of crazy ways out here.  Right, Marceline?  Marceline!  Marcy!!  Hehehe.
Hunson Abadeer|  There you are, Marceline.  Huh?  Oh. Hello, dog. Hello, Finn. 
Finn|  Stay away from me, old man! 
Jake|  Heheheh, nice one.
Hunson|   Now Finn, come on, there's no bad blood here!  Come here, let's bury the hatchet!  See how I'm not killing you?
Marceline|   Dad, stop!
Hunson|   Alright, I don't want to embarrass my little girl.  So young lady, have you thought about my offer?
Jake|   What offer, Marceline's dad?
Hunson|   I want Marceline to take over the Nightosphere! Finally join the family business!
Marceline|  Business? Dad, what do you even do?
Hunson|  Oh!  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on...  Check it out, sweetie.  See how chaotic it is out there?  How everyone's confused and frustrated? The Nightosphere is sustained by chaos!
Marceline|  Eh, I just don't see my self doing this biz'.
Hunson|   Okay. But I know you'll come around eventually. Or maybe you won't! I don't know. You're an independent woman!  Well, I'm gonna take a nappy.  Oh! I almost forgot! 
Marceline|  Dad!
Hunson|  Whoops! Hahaha!  You should put this amulet on. It'll grant you wishes for, like, ponies. Or whatever kids like.
Marceline|  Dad, I'm a thousand years old.
Hunson|  Ha! Yes you are, sweetie.  Daddy's little monster! 
Marceline|   Look, let's play something, okay?
Finn|  Okay!
Marceline|"   I know you just wanna give your little girl the world, but Daddy I'm not just your little girl. I've got my own life, I've got my own plans, I hope you understand and like the way that I am because I want your respect and I want to be here. But I don't wanna rule the Nightosphere.  Psssh. Whatever, Dad. [Puts the amulet on. A suit comes out of it and wraps itself around her. The phone is dropped and tentacles are seen. The phone is picked up and Marceline is seen looking like her father's monster's form in ""It Came from the Nightosphere."" The camera zooms out to show Finn approaching Marceline while she laughs evilly."
Finn|  Jake, grab the amulet! 
Jake|  Ow, my hippocampus!
Jake|  Well... that explains how we got amnesia-ed.  But what about banana?
Finn|  Hey man, there's another video!
Demon|  We got mad prison overcrowding down here, fellas.  So I gotta put you in the cage with the stuff. Sorry about that. But, you know, not really.  Aw, my stomach! 
Finn|  That amulet's controlling Marceline! We have to go back and help her!  We're gonna get back using that one portal spell we know!  Maloso vobiscum et cum spiritum! 
Jake|   Whoa, dude!  She told us never to come back!
Finn|  Oh yeah. Oh!  Jake! Can you turn into a gross demon?
Jake|  Mhmm. 
Finn|  Grosser!
Jake|   What's your disguise?
Finn|   Paper plate mask, yo!
Jake|  Nice!
Finn|  Let's go! 
Marceline|  Who's next? Who's next? 
Weird Punishment Demon|"  Uh... me, my lord ""Aberdeer."""
Marceline|  What do you desire, cowering spec? Pain? Pleasure? Or... weird punishment?
Weird Punishment Demon|  Uh... pleasure.
Marceline|  No, weird punishment!   And what do you desire? P, P, or WP?
Big Demon|  I... pain?
Marceline|  Okay. 
Big Demon|  Aw.
Marceline|  Come on, come on, next!
Ab Demon|  Uh... I'm just gonna go.
Marceline|  You sure, dude? Don't you want abs?
Ab Demon|  Yeah, gimme abs! 
Finn|  I think we can charge up there and rip the amulet off her neck. 
Line Demon|"  Hey! What're you guys doin'?! You can't run up to the front of the line! These good people have been waiting forever! Shame on you both! Everybody, shame them!  Boo, sir! I ""boo"" what you're doing! Step back!  Back!  You will not cut the line!  Again!  You stay back here! And wait your turn like the rest of us!  Under... stand?!"
Finn|  Yeah, okay, okay!
Line Demon|  I'll be watching you! 
Demon in line|  Sorry dude, you got outta line. I-
Line Demon|  Dang it! 
Marceline|  Who are you?
Finn|  Ahh! Don't kill us Marceline!
Jake|  It's us! Finn and Jake!
Finn|   Your friends, remember?
Marceline|  Eh. 
Jake and Finn|  Oh Grod!
Finn|  Run!  Marceline...
Finn|  What are you doing?
Hunson|  Just grabbing a midnight snack. 
Finn|  It's Marceline! That's her out there!
Hunson|  I know!  Isn't it fantastic?
Finn|   No! We have to save 'er!
Hunson|   Save her?
Finn|  From the amulet!
Hunson|  But this is what I've always wanted! My girl, following in her daddy's footsteps.
Finn|  But that's not what she wants!
Hunson|  That's balderdash, baby. The wearer of the amulet is filled with chaotic evil! Which is how I grew up. So... 
Finn|  Maybe we can get these dudes to help us! 
Jake|  These guys won't help you. They're all complacent sheeple. 
Finn|  Wait, that's it! We're gonna freestyle a political rap to get these guys to rise out of their systemized demon apathy.
Jake|   Okay... 
Demon in crowd|  I never thought of it that way before!
Demon in crowd #2|  The system is broke, yo!
Finn|  Marceline! 
Jake|  Aw, sick!
Finn|   Jake! The tree house!
Jake|  Ahhhh! I'm too freaked out to move, Finn! These demons are nibbling my legs! 
Finn|   Jake! Take her! 
Jake|  No, Finn! You'll be filled with chaotic evil!
Finn|  Marceline...  No one...  leaves the Nightosphere!
Hunson| Marceline! Um, I wonder what happened to him! Kids these days... am I right?
Jake|  Dude... seriously.
Marceline|  Dad, you tricked me.  Dad, that sucks!
Hunson|  I know, I'm sorry. But I thought you'd want to, want to make your old man proud and you know... take over the Nightosphere.
Marceline|  Yeah, I want you to be proud. I want you to be proud of me!
Hunson|  No, I didn't mean... Baby, of course I'm proud of you.
Marceline|  Dad...
Hunson|  And your friends? They're alright! That political rap?  Pretty great!
Marceline|  Okay, okay, I gotta go now, Dad.  Woof. What a nightmare. Man, Finn, my dad actually likes you. I don't wanna hang out with you anymore.  Finn?
Finn|" ""B.R.B. - Jake"". Hmm. B.R.B... B.R.B. Bring regular babies. Big red balls. No. Beautiful rump burger."
BMO| What you doing, Finn?
Finn| Jake left me this note, but I, uh  I can't remem what the abbreve means.
BMO|  It's for me! This is Jake's special code to tell me he loves me.
Finn| No, it's something normal like, uh...
BMO| Be right back. 
Finn|" Right! ""Be right back!""  So dumb. Cool. Jake'll be right back."
BMO| Look, Finn! My Jake Valentines. He leaves them for me when he goes out.
Finn| That's cute, BMO.
BMO| Yeah, I know.
Finn| Oh, Ble. I love Ble!  I'll read some Ble 'til Jake gets back, I guess.
Finn|"  ""What's your favorite food?"" ""Anything! As long as it's made of cheese!""  Aw, man, these comics are like if someone put my soul on a page.  Hmm? ""You write the caption."" Okay! Hmm.  ""Ouch! Hey, this isn't helping.""  Yeah.  Ja - I mean, BMO!"
Finn| Check this funny caption I just wrote.
BMO| Hmm.  No humor detected.
Finn|" What? No, it's - it's like... this guy's problem is a tiger biting his foot, and talking to this guy isn't helping! Like, ""Ouch! Hey, this isn't helping!"" You know, like, it's, you know, like..."
BMO| Was the tiger already biting his foot? Or did the tiger bite his foot after he lay down on the couch? Because that is the bearded man's responsibility.
Finn| BMO, I love you, but you don't understand comedy.
BMO| Maybe it's just not funny.
Finn|  This is funny, and I'm gonna prove it!
BMO| You are?
Finn| Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty bored, and this is really funny, BMO.
BMO|  Prove it!
Finn|  Fine! I'm going to!
BMO| Fine!  I'll be right here!
Finn| Fine!
BMO| Fine!
Princess Bubblegum| Bwee-woo-bwee-woo! This is a drill!  I repeat, this is a drill! 
Candy people| Oh no! A real drill?!
Princess Bubblegum| You two, raise your resinous glaze shields! 
Candy people| Oh, oh, oh, oh!
Princess Bubblegum| Activate the B.H.T. to preserve freshness!
Princess Bubblegum| We're not ready.
Candy people| Intruder! Intruder! It's our friend, Finn!
Finn| What's all the hubbub, Bubs?
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, just some precautionary exercises in case our primary alarm and defense system fails.
Finn| Cool. Cool. Hey, can you look at this funny thing I wrote?
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, sure! I'm fascinated by humor.  Hmm! Yes. Certainly what this hirsute gentleman needs is a tetanus shot. Excellent point, Finn.
Finn| No, but... is it funny? Never mind.
Princess Bubblegum| I don't have time to explain the psychology of humor to you.  But I'd like you to read this book.
Kenneth|  Hey, what do you think you're - Oh! Princess Bubblegum!  Thank you, Princess.
Princess Bubblegum|" Der Witz Und Seine Beziehung Zum Unterbewussten. ""The Joke and his Relation to the Unconscious"". It's printed in Gebrochene Schrift, which I think is easier on the eyes."
Finn|" ""Der Witz Und... Der Witz Und... See-einy... Bezeyhung... Zumbewuzzzz..."" Ugh! PB's too smart. That's why she doesn't get my joke. I mean... it's funny.  It's funny. ""Ouch, hey this isn't-""  ""This isn't helping.""  Uh, it's super funny. Turbo-nerds like PB just aren't the right audience for this sort of thing, you know? I should show this to normal people, the common folk. The busy woman on the go. The regular Joe or Josephine. Or somebody like Ice King, who's desperate for my approval."
Ice King|  Finn, this is so funny! A kitty with big teeth?! Come on!
Finn|  Yeah, I didn't draw that, but cool. Well, thanks for-
Ice King|" Oh, yeah. But, uh, what if - and I'm just spitballin'. What if it was something more like, ""Hey, Doc! I got a caveman in my teeth!"" Huh?"
Ice King| Haha! Whoo!
Finn| Heh. Yeah. That's pretty good, I guess.
Ice King| Oh, is this Ble? I love Ble! That one with the two cops who are always accidentally arresting each other.
Finn|" Right?! And ""Animal Quackers""!"
Ice King| I've been mailing them my short stories and comics for as long as I can remember. But, uh, nary a piece published. Nary a piece.  Nary a piece! I hate Ble! Sittin' in their ivory towers! They don't know comedy! They don't understand the common folk! The busy woman on the go!
Ice King and Finn|  The average Joe or Josephine! Right!
Ice King| See? We got the goods, you and I, and they've lost their touch. Hey, if we want them to touch our goods, we should go down there and confront them face-to-face.
Finn| And if I get my winning caption printed, everybody will know it's funny! I'm talking about you, BMO. But, uh, where do they print Ble?
Ice King| Oh, yeah. I don't, uh... Oh! Oh! Yeah, hold this. I'll use my... demonic wishing eye!
Wishy| Hello, Ice King.
Ice King| Hello, Wishy!
Wishy| What do you like to wish for?
Ice King| I wish to go to Ble!
Wishy| You go, girl!
Finn| Whoa. Why don't you just use that thing all the time?
Ice King| Oh, it takes a piece of your soul each time you use it. But look! The legendary Bledquarters!
Finn| It must be so fun to work here, just sittin' around, making up jokes all day.
Pudding Troll| Hey! Hey.
Finn| Aww. Who are you?
Pudding Troll| I'm a pudding troll, and I guard this humor magazine.
Finn| Uhhhh, why?
Pudding Troll| It's... my job.
Finn| Why is this your job?
Pudding Troll| I... applied? I'm maybe not following you. I think I better escort you off the premises.
Finn| No! No, no, no. We just want to pitch a cartoon caption!
Pudding Troll|  Hey, Big Tina, it's your time to shine, okay?
Finn| Waahh!
Finn| Okay, what's our plan here?
Ice King| Maybe if we eat all this ammo, he'll be forced to make more for us.
Finn| Wait. You can fly!
Pudding Troll| Uh-oh! Angle up, Big Tina!
Pudding Troll| Uh-oh! Ugh!
Pudding Troll| You win. Fine. I've never let anyone inside before, so I hope you have an amazing pitch.
Ice King| Hey! These are all my submissions! They kept them in a big pile by the door... Seems like a good sign!
Finn| Well, shoot, man. Looks like everyone here is crazy dead.
Pudding Troll| I've been guarding dead people for five hundred years. Wow, I need to sit with that.
Finn| This means that Ble Magazine is dead, too!  Now how am I supposed to prove my caption's funny.
Ice King| Ding dong! I found Ble 217! We can see what the winning caption was.
Finn|"  ""I'm going to write you a prescription for one giant club."" "
Ice King| It's about time us young guns took the reins.
Ice King| Hello, boys. Now let's roll these presses one last time.
Finn| Our very own Ble Magazine.
Ice King|" And it's a pretty good issue, too. We got that nice cover you did, my short story, ""Fionna and Cake Baby Detectives"", some, looks like, pudding jokes..."
Pudding Troll| Big Tina wrote those!
Ice King|" ...""Fionna and Cake Baby Detectives Go to College"", and, of course, your caption!"
Finn| Wow. It looks amazing in print.
Pudding Troll| Guys, I'm gonna be honest, just speaking as an average Josephine, I really don't get that caption.
Finn| Maybe it doesn't matter if my caption is funny or not. I think I just wanted to be part of Ble. It's something I've been a fan of for so long. And maybe we can bring it back. There's no reason it can't have a new dawn. A Blennaissance!
Ice King| Okay, boys, close her down!
Finn|  No, you're right. Can't be nostalgic!
Finn| Man, that caption was amazing in my head. Maybe I'm not a very funny person. Like, I got low comedy stats. That's kind of a bummer.
Finn| Yo, BMO. Check it out! I got Ble to publish my caption, even though I don't need you to think I'm funny anymo-
Peppermint Butler|  Evil is rising. In vile power, the fiend walks among us again. The Vampire King. With all my investigations into the supernatural, I should know better, but I can't help it. I'm dying to see him in person!  I probably will die if I see him in person.
Peppermint Butler| Hello?
Jake| Yo, yo, yo, yo! Bubblegum sent me for the bucket.
Peppermint Butler| Dozo. 
Jake| Merci and adios.
Peppermint Butler| Wait! Uh... how's it going?
Jake| It's good, you know? Uh, Marceline's got all her powers back. She's getting ready to give the Vampire King a big, fat whompin', uh, I hope.
Peppermint Butler| Um, while that's going down, do you think you could ask the V.K. to sign something for me?
Jake| That would be weird. You're weird. 
Marceline| I dreamed about you while I was in my poison coma. I was old and withered, and you were still nice and pink.
Princess Bubblegum|  You think I'm nice? Oh, brains! I lost count.
Marceline| That's okay. I'm done with bat jacks.  I have this weird feeling in my tums.
Princess Bubblegum| 'Cause you're scared of The Vampire King?
Marceline| No, it's not fear. I know what that feels like. So, maybe it's...love?  Oh! What is it?!
Jake|  It's the herald of a new snack dawn! 
Marceline|  Oh, yeah.
Princess Bubblegum| I arranged a snacky-snack for the team.
Jake|  I love you, Bonnibel.
Marceline| Yeah, me too, Bonnibel.  Ohh!  Holy macaroni! Can we do this all the time?
Princess Bubblegum| Later, we can, all the time. But, for now-now, we got to get our plan together.
Marceline|  Easy. First, we take down the V.K, kill him, destroy him, and...kill him! 
Jake| I like this plan! It's got good bones!
Princess Bubblegum| Well, the devil's in the details. Like, how do we even find him?
Vampire King| I come to you! 
Marceline| Vampire King!
Vampire King| In the flesh!
Marceline| Not for long, sucker! 
Vampire King| Whoa! I just want to talk.
Jake| Oh really! Why don't you step inside for a nice chat? 
Vampire King| No, thank you. 
Vampire King| Just hear me out, Marceline.
Princess Bubblegum|  Hear this!
Marceline|  Ouch!
Vampire King| Will you calm down and listen to-
Finn| YAHHH! 
Finn|  Shoot.
Princess Bubblegum|  Sorry.
Vampire King| Stay calm, and nobody gets hurt. I know what you must think of me, and you'd be right.  My thirst for blood is an awesome force. But in these new times, I have a chance to try a different course. 
Vampire King| I think I wanna-
Finn| Roll out!  Thorn arm!  ACTIVATE!
Finn|  You gonna help, or what?
Vampire King|  Let me finish my thought.
Finn|  Stake you!  Okay, go ahead.
Vampire King| This is the old way. Agents of darkness and light in a tug-of-war. But now, a creature can step out of that struggle. In this age, why would I want to be the Vampire King anymore?
Princess Bubblegum|  I don't know, why would you?
Vampire King| I wouldn't. I submit.  Take the vampire essence from my blood. Free me from the shackles of my station.
Marceline|  YAHHHH!  FINN! What the heck?!
Finn| It's against my code to strike a foe who's raised his bottom to the sky. The Enchiridion explicitly states so.
Marceline| Dem are your rules.
Finn| Dem a good rule dhough.
Marceline| Outta my way!
Finn| Ep, ep, ep, ep, ep! Look.  Look at these babies. These pleadin' puppies.
Finn| Whoops. Shoulda staked him.
Vampire King| How many times do you wanna do this, Marceline? Our lives have magnetized. We're in a negative loop.  But we can change our outcome this time!
Marceline| I like the outcome where you get staked!
Vampire King| And you become a vampire?
Vampire King| Marceline.  I know I was ruthless in the past. But tell me, what's the one thing you've noticed about the world, since you beat me all those hundreds of years ago?
Marceline| Everything repeats over and over again. No one learns anything, 'cause no one lives long enough to see the pattern, I guess.
Vampire King| But you've lived long enough.
Marceline| I know. Duh.
Vampire King| And you still think this is the right way? Fighting me?
Marceline| The other way's like a black hole; an unknown.
Vampire King| So let's consult a witch-
Marceline|  No witches.
Vampire King|  I'm not afraid of the unknown!  I have the power-  -to change destiny! Queen of vampires! You weigh the scales of fate. Spill my guts, or face the unknown. Either way, I will not bite. For turning you would subjugate me to the wheel of fortune. And I am a king, not a hamster. My path runs straight into the void, on a sick, flaming chariot!  Stake me. I will not hide.  Do it, chicken! You make me sick! 
Marceline| Okay, dag! We'll take your stupid thing out!
Vampire King|  My what?
Marceline| Your dang vamp juice, come on!
Vampire King| Cool. 
Finn| Let 'er rip!
Princess Bubblegum| Wait!
Jake| Whoops. 
Marceline|  Truce, you guys.
Vampire King| No funny business.
Princess Bubblegum| No funny business us, or you?
Marceline| Him.
Jake|  What happened to your pants?
Jake| Hold that thought! 
Finn|  Finish him! Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam-
Marceline| Finn, you can stop.
Finn| Oh, okay, now we're stopping.  Sorry, dude.
Vampire King|  It's chill.  See? No funny business.
Finn|  Hey, Jake.
Jake|  What?
Finn|"  ""PB says she's gonna set her vampire sucking machine to full blast if he tries anything funny."""
Jake|"  ""What does full blast even mean?"""
Finn|"  ""I guess it means he'll explode to dust."""
Jake|"  ""Well, what do you want to eat later?"""
Princess Bubblegum|"  ""Hey guys!"""
Finn and Jake|"  ""What?"""
Princess Bubblegum|"  ""Mouth fart code is for emergencies only."""
Finn|"  ""Sorry!"""
Peppermint Butler| Be cool. Be like, 'How's it going, VK? I'm Peppermint B and I know all about you!' No, that sounds lame. 'Yo, V.K., sign my book, jerk!' No...
Princess Bubblegum|  We're home!
Princess Bubblegum| Is the lab ready?
Peppermint Butler|  Of course. Is he here? 
Vampire King|  Hey.
Peppermint Butler|  AAHHH! SAY SOMETHING; ASK HIM TO SIGN THE BOOK!
Vampire King|  Meh. 
Peppermint Butler|  DO IT, HE'S GETTING AWAY! 
Peppermint Butler| Wait! Just a sec! Can you sign-
Princess Bubblegum|  Sorry. Too late.
Vampire King|  Hey. Peppermint Butler. I can hear your brains. Look inside your book.
Princess Bubblegum|  Okay, shields down, everybody!
Peppermint Butler|  A psychic autograph! Thank you, your darkness.
Princess Bubblegum|  Here we go.
Princess Bubblegum| His vampire essence is now completely drained.  Well, let's see what we've got left.
Marceline|  Kitty!
Jake|  Best makeover ever!
Princess Bubblegum|  Hey Pep.
Peppermint Butler|  M'lady?
Princess Bubblegum| Are you sure your peepers are all right?
Peppermint Butler| My inner vision is extraordinarily developed.
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, great. 'Cause I need you to go to the secret catacombs and bury this nasty bucket of sludge in the deep-deep down.  Just be uber-duber careful not to drop it. Pure vampire essence this powerful could kaboom reality off its whack.
Peppermint Butler| Don't drop the bucket.
Princess Bubblegum| Exactly. 
Peppermint Butler|  Will do.
Jake|  Mm... buckie...
Peppermint Butler|  Nooooooo!
Squid Bartender|  You guys sure you want another round of squid ink? 
Head Marauder|   You're not too bad for a human boy!
Finn|  Not too bad!? I'm better than that!  Huh?  Jake! Do you hear that?
Jake|   What'd you say? Whoa! 
Finn|  I think someone's crying.  Stop!  This is serious! I gotta go find out where that crying is coming from! 
Head Marauder|  Get back here you chickeeeen!
Marauders|  Ohhhhhhhh! 
Finn|   What did you call me?
Head Marauder|  You can't just walk away from a roughhouse!
Finn|   Hey! Listen up you cold-hearted marauders! Someone's out there crying for help and I'm not gonna ignore that!
Jake|  Awwww here it comes! Lay it down Finn!
Finn|  A long time ago when I was a baby, I went boom boom on a leaf. Boom! Boom!  And I fell backwards and sat in my own boom boom. I cried for a day. But no one came to help me.  That day I vowed to help anyone in need! No matter how small their problem.  And that's why I need to go. 
Jake|   He still cries when he poops. Thanks for being cool guys. Wait up, Finn!  It's comin' from up there!
Finn|  Someone must be caught in that avalanche! Let's get it on!  So, who's crying?
Mountain Man|  I am.
Finn|  Whoa! Aww, what's wrong fella? You cryin' boulders?
Mountain Man|  Yes, I am sad. Having been forced to watch roughhousing men for centuries.
Finn|  Ohhhh! I see. You're feeling left out and you wanna roughhouse too! Well I can take you on tough guy! Come on Jake! Back me up! 
Jake|  Yeah, do it Finn! Hit 'im with a boulder! And then hit 'im with another rock!
Mountain Man|  Please! No roughhousing! It…m-makes…me…soooo.. SAD! 
Finn|  Huh? Why?
Mountain Man|  Because they're so rough on each other!
Finn|   But a smooth well controlled roughhouse bolsters your guts and rejuvenate the muscle.
Mountain Man|  No! It's raunchy and maddening! All those men and their disgusting fantastic bodies!
Jake|  Whoa. This guy's got problems.
Finn|   
Ladybug kid|  Look mommy! 
Ladybug Lady|  Honey! Don't look! That kid's got problems! 
Finn|  I'll help you mountain!
Jake|  Whoa! What!
Finn|  I'll stop those roughhousers from being rough!
Mountain Man|  Really? You'd do that for me?
Finn|  Yes sir! My names Finn and I'm gonna help you out!
Jake|  But Finn, we're not gonna shut down the roughhouse for real are we?
Finn|  No way! But there's got to be some kind of solution. I’ll figure this out Mountain Man!  Yup!
Head Marauder|  Aw! Finn! Ready to get destroyed!
Finn|  N-nooo! Wait, um, actually, could you guys stop being so rough.
Marauders|  What!? 
Head Marauder|  Whoa whoa whoa!  What are you talking about Finn?
Finn|  Could you guy just tone down the roughhousing a little?
Marauder|  What!? 
Head Marauder|  Whoa! Hey, hey. Shh. It's all right fellas. Finn, I'm sure this tone down the roughing thing has something to do with your boom boom, and I can respect that, but how can we POSSIBLY, Make roughhousing, Less rough?!
Finn|   I think I have a perfect idea!  This'll soften your punches for smooth knock outs. Like punching a dream!
Marauder|   Ha! Ha! Pigs on my knees! Pigs on my knees! 
Jake|  That’s like math 
Finn|  Mathematical.  What do ya think? Fixed all you’re problems right!
Mountain Man|  No! That was terrible! Now they’re just punching animals! It’s worse than before and it’s in no way a good solution!
Finn|  I’m sorry!
Mountain Man|  Well you should be! It’s not fair to those animals and it’s not fair to me! I might just start to cry again, you know? 
Jake|  Aw, man.
Finn|  Come on Jake. I gotta give this another shot!
Jake|  Finn this guy seems like a real nut job. You know what I mean? I don’t wanna get sucked into this guy’s hang-ups.
Finn|  Yes I do Jake. That’s what I vowed! To help anyone in need! No matter how small their problem!  At least I have to try brother.
Jake|   So be it brother.
Finn|  Hey guys. I’m back.  Hey guys. Guys? Men! Men. Please stop a second. Men! Boys? Please? I have more to ask of you! Bros? My bros?  Brother?
Marauder|  What? Did you just pet me? I’ll pet you! Pet pet! Heeeey! Pet pet. Hey this is great! 
Marauder|  Hey! Did you just pet me?!
Marauder|  Yeah! I did!
Marauder|  Well I’ll pet you back! Wha-whoa. What the-? This is awesome! 
Finn|  Alright! This could be it! 
Head Marauder|  Finn!  You're really mixin' things up in the best of ways today!
Jake|   Maybe you can solve everyone's problems. Like a cherub with its bottom out.
Finn|   Okay, cool. Hey, I'm gonna go tell the mountain.
Jake|  Alright I’m gonna-  stay here this time.
Finn|   So, everything's fine this time, right?
Mountain Man|  Yes! Thank you Finn!
Finn|   So the mountain is totally fine with everyone petting. I feel great.
Jake|  Right on man! The marauders are going crazy over the petting! They're petting each other raw! Check ‘em out!
Finn|   They look kinda rashy.
Head Marauder|  Hey Finn! Hey man. As you can see the petting got sorta out of hand.  Stop that! We are done with that! We’re going back to roughhousing!
Finn|  No wait fellas! The mountain doesn't like roughhousing.
Head Marauder|  Well we don’t like not roughhousing! Ya see the problem here?
Finn|  Well. Well what if we rotate the entire mountain 180 degrees around, so the mountain’s facing the other direction. That way, you guys can keep roughhousing and the mountain doesn't have to watch it!
Head Marauder|  Sounds fine with me!
Finn|  What do ya say mountain!
Mountain Man|  That’s okay. Only if you guys promise to stay healthy and not roughhouse after you rotate me.
Head Marauder|  That mountain can talk?
Jake|  Just promise him anything, he’s out of his gourd.
Head Marauder|  Yeah! We’ll stay healthy!
Mountain Man|  Oh! Thank goodness! Alright kids, spin me the math around!
Finn|  Now I just need to set up some sort of pulley system.
Mountain 2|  No! Over here! Don’t turn him around! If you do, I’ll miss looking at his beautiful back! It’s gorgeous!
Mountain Man|  Huh? What? Really!?
Finn|  What!? A-but-ahh. Um, maybe what we can do is...
Mushroom Creatures|  Excuse me. We need your help. There’s no music playing and we desperately want to dance!
Finn|  Oh, ah just a second you guys. I’ll a- I’ll help you out in one minute.
Coal Man|  Hey! Pipe down over there! I want some peace and quiet!
Finn|  Let me just a-
Cactus Creature|  I need to be pollinated!
Finn|  Huh!?
Cactus Creature|  Pollinated all over to make my babies!
Finn|  Everybody please! One problem at a time!
Dragon|   My butt's itchy, but I can't scratch it!
Ice Cube Creature|  This water's too cold! 
Fish|  Mommy! Please keep the flies away from our mommy. 
Electroids|   That guy stole our triangle.
Toad|   They swiped my plum.
Marauders|  We wanna roughhouse! We wanna roughhouse!
Naked Wizard|  I’m naked! 
Mountain Man|   What’s happening!
Finn|   Ahhhhh! Everybody wants different things! And some of them want stuff that’s exactly the thing the others don’t want.
Jake|  Whoa, dude. Hold on. So this guy wants this and that guy wants that, but man. What do you want? 
Joshua|  Want do you want baby?  Why are you crying? Margaret, this baby won’t tell me what’s wrong with it, and it’s stuck to a leaf, and it stinks.
Margaret|   Give it here Joshua. This baby needs love and kisses to be happy.  There. See? Now it’s happy.
Joshua|  You just kissed a boom boom baby. So don’t expect any more sugar from me, sweetheart until we wash your dirty dirty face. 
Finn|   Hmm. Jake. What I want is to help anyone in need, so everyone is happy!
Jake|   Wow, that’s pretty corny man, but let’s do it dude! Wooohoo!
Finn|   Ready over there mushroom gang?
Mushroom Creatures|  Ready Finn!
Finn|  Ready dragon?
Dragon|  Yes sir!
Finn|  Ready Mountain Man?
Mountain Man|  …I’m ready.
Finn|  Go!
Fish|   Yay! The flies are leaving!
Coal Man|   Heh. Can't hear a thing! 
Cactus Creature|   Pollen! Here they come! 
Dragon|   Oh yeah! 
Naked Wizard|   Not naked! 
Mountain Man|   Hey, I can't see anything! Is anyone roughhousing?
Jake|  No!
Mountain Man|  Radical.
Mountain 2|   And I can still see this gorgeous back!
Mountain Man|  Thank you Finn! You really helped everybody!
Jake|   Stop! I've got a problem.
Finn|  Well, what's the matter?
Jake|  This dolphin fell in love with me!
Finn|  That's the opposite of a problem!  Adventure Time!
Engagement Ring Princess|  Save me, Finn and Jake.
Jake|  Shoosh.
Engagement Ring Princess|  Save me, Finn and Jake.
Jake|   We are...
Engagement Ring Princess|  Save me... Finn and Jake.
Jake|  Why does she keep saying that?
Finn|  I think she's traumatized, dude.
Jake|  Don't worry, princess. We're gonna get you out of here.  Whoo-hoo! yeah! yeah!
Ice King|   Huh eh! What was that?!  Darling, are you alright? I thought I heard a—  Oh, I see what happened. She broke up with me!  Well, it's your mistake, missy! This Ice King is gonna be fine!
Ice King|   Why did she leave? I put so much cool stuff in her little prison! Come on, old boy, keep it together  Hey, maybe she called me!  Please, please, please! Doo-doo... doo, doo-doo, doo-doo. No new messages?!  Raaaaa!
Ice King|   This is where she use to do her business. Uh, I'm so tired of looking at this face.  Aa, hee hee, not bad! And now for some healthy exercise! Ha ha, I'm forgetting about that silly old breakup already! 
Ice King|   Alright, let's fly!  Oof! You fool, you can't fly without your beard.  I'm gonna be alone forever.
Slime Princess|   Hi!
Ice King|  Beautiful princess.
Slime Princess|  Excuse me for approaching you, sir. You just seem so approachable. 
Ice King|   That's funny, usually my looks put people off.
Slime Princess|  
Ice King|   Is someone paying you to do this?
Slime Princess|   Tell me about yourself.
Ice King|  Well, there's not much to tell, really. I'm an ice king.
Slime Princess|  Oooh, a nice King.
Ice King|  Ha haha, no no, dear you misheard me. I'm not a nice king, I'm a—  A really nice king! And I'm single!
Slime Princess|  
Lumpy Space Princess|  Oh my gosh!  Hmm, yeah, guess what, Slime Princess is in the park, and she's, like, talking to a new nice king and he's, like, totally single.  By the way... don't tell anybody!
Peanut Princess|   There's a new king in town! 
Finn|"  Heh heh and I was all like ""Leave him alone!"" and he was like ""Make me!"" and I was like ""Okay!"" and then he was like ""Aaah, my head!"" Ah haha.  Dude, what are you doing?"
Jake|  Trying to get a signal, it's like everyone in Ooo is on their phones or something.  Aww man. 
Princess Princess Princess|   Have you guys...  seen the new...  nice king?
Finn|  Nice King?
Princess Princess Princess|   Yeah!  He's single...  and he's ours!  Now, get out of our way! 
Finn|  
Jake|  Man, now we have to kick that frog out of his new home.
Finn|  Nah, let him keep it. Hey, there's a new king and he's nice, we should offer our services!
Jake|  Finn & Jake-style!
Princess|  Yoo hoo! Nice King, Nice King over here!
Ice King|  Ladies, I'll have time to meet you individually later, please just, just stop squirming.
Turtle Princess|  But this looks like a prison.
Ice King|  Prison? Don't be ridiculous! It's a... waiting room! Stop squirming.
Finn & Jake|   Nice King! Yeeeaah! 
Ice King|  Finn and Jake! You'll never take me alive! 
Finn & Jake|   Huh? 
Finn|  You're the nice king, right?
Ice King|   Oh yeah, I keep forgetting that.
Finn|  Well, we will honor and serve you.
Ice King|  Serve me?
Finn|  Yeah! We wanna be your nice knights.
Ice King|   Sounds... nice...
Finn & Jake|  
Ice King|  With my rod of niceness, I dub thee two my Nice Knights. 
Finn & Jake|  Yeeah! We're knights! Niiice...
Finn|  Who do you want us to nice knight against?
Space Angel Princess|  Nice King, I love you!
Engagement Ring Princess|  Did I tell you that I like the opera? But if you don't, I hate it!
Princesses|  Nice King!
Ice King|   Please! I'm trying to tell my Nice Knights something! 
Ice King|   Come here.  The main enemy to the Nice King right now is the disorganization of his love life.
Finn|  W-well, what do you mean?
Ice King|  The ugly ones are all mixed up with the other ones! I need you to catalog them... or something.
Jake|  Tah ha, but we punch monsters.
Ice King|  After I choose my bride, then you can go punch the monsters.
Finn|  Managing admirers? We'll give it a try...
Finn|  Let's move onto something easier. Um, do you like drums?
Bee Princess|  Um, am I supposed to?
Jake|  She's dodging the question.
Bee Princess|  
Finn|  Are you fond of men with magical abilities?
Ghost Princess|  I'm really nervous right now... I-I just really want to meet a nice king.
Jake|  You can go back to the waiting room now, ma'am!
Ghost Princess|  I screwed it up, didn't I! 
Jake|  I think we did a good job.
Finn|  I don't feel good making a princess cry, this is not how knights are suppose to act.
Jake|  Finn, knights are loyal to their king.
Finn|  I'm still not sure...
Jake|  Aa Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba! Loyalty to the King! 
Finn|  Can't argue with that!
Ice King|   Hey, Nice Knights, Turtle Princess is about to walk out that door, I told her that I like her a lot, but I really don't like her all that much, could you guys break it off for me?
Finn|  The Nice King is not looking for a relationship right now.
Jake|  Get out of here!
Turtle Princess|  
Finn|   He's just not ready for a relationship!
Jake|  Alright! We did it, dude! 
Finn|   I feel terrible, I need to talk to the Nice King about this.
Ice King|  Yes, yes, keep walking in a circle. 
Finn|  Nice King, may I speak with you for a moment?
Ice King|  Princesses, I must speak with my knight in private. Go on back into your cage.
Princesses|  Bye, Nice King. 
Ice King|  What's up, knight?
Finn|  I don't like treating princesses this way, I don't wanna... I don't wanna do this anymore.
Ice King|   Your loyalty is in question?
Finn|  Oh, it's not that. It's just, princesses are suppose to be treated with niceness.
Ice King|   Are you implying that I'm not the nice king!
Finn|  Hey, what's wrong with you!
Ice King|  
Lumpy Space Princess|  Hey, I'm here.
Ice King|  Ugh, Finn, get rid of her.
Finn|  What?! No, man!
Ice King|  She's too loud and lumpy, I like smooth princesses... smoo-o-o-oth. 
Lumpy Space Princess|  I can be smooth!  Finn, punch out my lumps.
Finn|  What?!
Lumpy Space Princess|  I can be whatever he wants! I can change!
Finn|  I can't punch a princess!
Ice King|  Gaah! Finn, just punch her! Let me see what she looks like... smoo-o-o-oth.
Finn|  Oooo...
Lumpy Space Princess|  Yes! Hit me, hit me, hit me!
Finn|   Uuh, I'm sorry, Lumpy Space Princess, I just can't punch you!
Lumpy Space Princess|  Are you serious?! Fine, I'll do it myself. 
Finn|  Princess no!
Ice King|  Wait a minute Nice Knight, let's see what she can do. 
Lumpy Space Princess|  There, how's that? Better? 
Ice King|  Meh, no, I-I don't like her.
Lumpy Space Princess|  This is all your fault, Finn!  Aaaaaah!
Finn|  King, I'm sorry, I just can't do this anymore punching princesses, breaking hearts, eh- it just doesn't seem nice at all.
Ice King|  Hey! You're on thin ice Nice Knight! 
Finn|  Huh?
Ice King|   The jig is up!
Finn|  What jig?
Ice King|  Ah, eh, heh heh, my jig is up. Up high! It's a highland jig.  And I have a new assignment for you, one with more knight related stuff, very important.
Finn|  Oh, wow, awesome! What is it?
Ice King|  The Ice King stole my razor, sneak into his trap-filled ice castle and retrieve it.  And don't look through the shoebox he keeps behind the laundry bag in the closet.
Finn|  Wha?!
Ice King|  Those are my orders!
Finn|  Yes, finally something knight-like!
Finn & Jake|   Get ready, Ice King, for battle!
Ice King|   And once I have my razor, I can select my elite army of wives and take over the world!
Finn|  Whoa, Jake, look at all his hair.
Jake|  Did this Ice King shave his back or something?
Finn|  Ha ha!  The Nice King's razor , Jake, look, check this out- Aaaah! 
Jake|  Relax, dude, it's just me.
Finn|   Ha ha, you look just like the Ice King.  And so do I.
Jake|  Heh hee heh. These whiskers would make anyone look like the Ice King.
Finn|  Ha haa, yeah, even the Nice King!
Finn & Jake|   The Nice King is the Ice King!
Ice King|  Ugh, what do the princesses see in this face? Hope I can keep this going. So many princesses to meet.  Whiskers!  I can't be growing whiskers now!  Daaarrr, I haven't picked who I want to marry me!
Finn|   Nice King!
Ice King|  Did you retrieve my stole razor?!
Finn|  Yeah and also this! 
Ice King|  My beard! I-I-I mean what is that?!
Jake|  Pfft, he knows what it is!
Finn|  Let's get him Jake! 
Lumpy Space Princess|  Stop! We're not gonna let you beat up the Nice King.
Finn|  He's not the Nice King, he's the Ice King!
Lumpy Space Princess|  We don't believe you!
Jake|  Man, these ladies really wanna get married.
Finn|   Jake, we can't beat up princesses!
Jake|  Relax dude  just get behind my ear shield.
Finn & Jake|  
Ice King|   Wait, I can't fly!
Finn|  Let me help ya! 
Jake|  
Finn|  
Ice King|  N-no, wait!
Finn|  Yaaaaaaa!  Now fly, ya liar! 
Ice King|  Ugh!  Oh, eh?  Ladies, ladies, heh heh, I can shave it off again, a-and when you get fat, I'll grow it back! Eh! 
Finn|  Now that's what I call, a close shave!
Jake|   Awww, haa haa hoo.
Fionna|  Throw it, Cake!
Fionna|  Eyahh! 
Fionna|  These Jelly Kinders aren't... alive, are they?
Prince Gumball|   What? No! They can't even talk.
Prince Gumball|  Kick it! Thanks for helping me out guys.
Cake|  What are these boogers for, anyway?
Prince Gumball|  Oh, they're decorations for my Biennial Gumball Ball. Tonight!
Fionna|  Sounds like it gonna be large.
Prince Gumball|  Yes! So very large. I'd like you to be there as my special guest.
Fionna|  You want me to go with you to the ball?
Prince Gumball|  Heck yes. As my pal!
Fionna|  Oh. Right.
Prince Gumball|  It starts at seven, so don't be late!
Cake|  Fionna, we got trouble! My tail is totally frizzin' out!
Fionna|  I'll check it out.
Fionna|  It's Ice Queen!
Ice Queen|  The Prince shall be mine!
Fionna|  Back inside!
Ice Queen|  Outta my way, tomboy!
Fionna|  Ice Queen, why are you always predatoring on dudes?
Ice Queen|  Ha! You should talk! Keeping all the babes to yourself, totally ice-blocking my game!
Fionna|  What?
Ice Queen|  Not  this time!
Prince Gumball|  Gah! Slush Beast!
Fionna|  Cake! Morning-star mode!
Prince Gumball|  You saved me from the Ice Queen!
Fionna|  Oh, uh, yeah I guess. Is she gone?
Prince Gumball|  She must have fled. Fionna, you're so strong. And you look so beautiful in the snow. What are you doing later?
Fionna|  I was just going to go home, I...
Prince Gumball|  Come with me. Let's go out.
Fionna|  Go... out?
Prince Gumball|  Yeah. Let's go somewhere.
Fionna|  What?
Cake|  We'd love to!
Prince Gumball|  Great! Meet me in the castle gardens in an hour!
Cake|   Yes, we'll be there!
Cake|  Oh, it's a date!
Fionna|"  No, it's not. I'm sure when he said ""go out,"" he meant ""go out,"" not ""go out!"""
Cake|  Shut up, he's into you!
Fionna|  Come on, you heard what he said. I'm like his guy-friend.
Cake|  Well, that could change tonight.
Fionna|  If it's a date, why are you coming?
Cake|  I'm coming to help you! Hold on, I'm bringing my dulcimer.
Fionna|   Man.
Cake|  It's a conversation starter. 
Fionna|  Fine, I'll do this if only to prove you wrong.
Fionna|  Mm... Let's just bail, I changed my mind.
Cake|  No! No retreat, girl.
Prince Gumball|  Hello, Fionna. And I see you brought Cake.
Fionna|  That's cool, right?
Prince Gumball|  Only if it's cool that I brought... Lord Monochromicorn!
Cake|  Hiya, gorgeous.
Lord Monochromicorn|   H-E-Y.
Prince Gumball|  Accept these tokens of our esteem.
Fionna|   Hey you didn't have to, guy...
Prince Gumball|  Nonsense. For you, Cake, a satchel of nepetalactone. Mo-Chro picked it himself.
Cake|  Catnip! Sweet babies! 
Prince Gumball|  And for you m'lady, a bouquet of posies.
Fionna|  Oh, uh, they're...
Prince Gumball|  There's a surprise at the center.
Fionna|  Huh! A crystal sword! I'm all about swords! How did you know?!
Prince Gumball|  I pay attention to things I see you being all about.
Fionna|  Thanks dude. It's just...WOW.
Prince Gumball|  Come, for the wowiness has only just begun!
Cake|  Psst, Fi, tell Gumball that you think he's HAWT.
Fionna|   What?! No!
Cake|   Guys like to hear that they're hot!
Fionna|   Will you keep your voice down?!
Prince Gumball|  Oh, Fionna!
Fionna|  Hey, what's up?
Prince Gumball|  I thought we might have a little race. A playful race to Marshmallowy Mweadows.
Fionna|  Okay, but I'm gonna kick your butt.  Not that I'm thinking of butts...
Prince Gumball|  Excellent. 
Cake|  After him, Fionna. After your man. 
Prince Gumball|   Good race, Fionna.
Cake|  Why are y'all breathless if we're the ones running?
Fionna|  Gumball!
Prince Gumball|  Sorry, I saw a pearl pygmy skull in there. It reminded me of you. The way your eyes sparkle. 
Prince Gumball|  Fionna, there's something I want to tell you.
Fionna|  Oh, my gosh, dude. That was, like, the stupidest thing ever.
Cake|  See you back at the tree house. 
Fionna|  Jeez, I dunno, I thought about it, but I think you could wear your pants as a shirt, if you really needed to.
Prince Gumball|   Okay, okay, now you ask me something.
Fionna|  Oh, um, is this a date?
Prince Gumball|   Fionna, come to the ball with me.
Fionna|  As your chum?
Prince Gumball|  No, as my girlfriend.
Fionna|  It was a date! There was singing and junk!
Cake|  I know! I was there for that part!
Fionna|  Cake, he wants me to come to the ball as his girlfriend!
Cake|  Oh, my goodness! It's almost seven! You need something to wear! Oh, hold on honey, I am gonna make this happen!
Fionna|  How am I supposed to fit my weapons in this?
Cake|  It's a ball! You don't need weapons!
Fionna|   I'll take my retractable sword.
Cake|  Okay! Lets go, go, go!
Prince Gumball|  I've been looking for you.
Fionna|  Well, here I am.
Prince Gumball|  Ha ha! Hey, I wanna show you something.
Fionna|  Okay. 
Cake|  Okay, girl! I'll see you later!
Fionna|  What? Hey, is this your bedroom?
Prince Gumball|  Fionna. 
Fionna|   Heh... whoa.  What?!
Ice Queen|  This was so much easier than I thought it would be! 
Fionna|  This is really messed up, Ice Queen! WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM WITH ME?! 
Ice Queen|  You're what stands between me and my Gumball! 
Fionna|  I can't believe I fell for this trash! You got me to show up with a dress! And a pur—  My purse! My sword!
Ice Queen|  You like my ice sword?
Fionna|  Get it off me!
Cake|  Fionna!
Prince Gumball|  Oh, my goodness. 
Cake|  WHAT'S GOING ON IN HE—  AAAHH! Don't you touch her! 
Fionna|  Shhh... It's okay, it's okay. It was the Ice Queen.
Ice Queen|  Paws off my prince!
Ice Queen|   My magic tiara... my powers!
Fionna|  And this is for yanking my heart guts! 
Cake|  Ha ha! I'm a queen! 
Fionna|  No, you might catch her crazy.
Prince Gumball|  Wow, Fionna. You're, you're just really incredible. Maybe we should meet up, for a date.
Fionna|   No way, man. Not interested.  I think the reason I got all these guy-friends and no boyfriend is because I don't really want to date any of 'em. I don't need feel like I'm waiting to be noticed. I know who I am. And I'll know what I want when and if it ever comes along. But there is one guy I would do anything to date.  The Ice King!
Prince Gumball|  What?!
Cake|  Me, too. Ice King's the real deal!
Fionna|  Ice King is the hottest hottie, and I can't wait— 
Ice King|"  ""—to marry him!"" said Fionna. Then she turned to Prince Gumball and said, ""I hope Ice King will sweep me off my feet and take me to the farthest corner of Ooo, where we will do nothing but kiss and eat a whole bunch until we get fat and die."" The end. So, what do you think of the fanfiction I wrote about you guys?"
Finn|  Uh...
Ice King|   Tell me you thought it was good!
Finn|  Uh, it's good! It's good! It's really good, dude! It was amazing!
Tree Trunks|  Shelby. Shelby, wake up.
Shelby|   Where am I? Tree Trunks, what's going on?!
Tree Trunks|  Uh, you've been snoozing on my dome. I just woke up in this room with these fellas Nectar, Ice Cream, and one of the Lemoncarbs.
Lemongrab| Awake.  Avast, hold tight your buns, if buns you do hold dear; for time has come to wake and run and not give way to fear!
Tree Trunks|  What are those awful words?
Lemongrab|   I'm reading the wall.  They are wall words.
Tree Trunks|  Beyond this room are a thousand rooms, outside of them still more.
Shelby|  Behind each door, on every floor, danger, danger, ever more.
Neptr|  Stranger, hark! The traps galore may kill you whilst you do explore. To free yourself - 
Ice King|   Huh? Oh. Now where were we? To free yourself from this tomb, and nevermore re-enter, find the room amidst the rooms that lies exactly center?
Shelby|  It's a map!
Lemongrab|  I no longer need this map. I have infallible recall.
Tree Trunks|  Oh! The room is trying to hug us!  Oh no!
Ice King|  Oh, dag.
Neptr|  Check out my mods, bro. 
Lemongrab|  Enough of this! 
Ice King|  Huh? This room doesn't have any doors. 
Tree Trunks|  W- We're trapped!
Lemongrab|   This is wrong. The map lied to me-e. It doesn't want me to find the EXIT! Ice King, h-how do you taste?
Ice King|  Uh, nice, I guess? 
Lemongrab|  Mild or SPICY?!
Ice King|  Oh, uh -  Kinda lonely.
Lemongrab|  Make yourself into food! Now!
Ice King|  You're going to eat me? Yeah, right.
Neptr|  Slop your mouths up. I have found an oven and baking supplies. 
Tree Trunks|  I can make an apple pie for all of us.
Lemongrab|  Make them fast, servile.
Tree Trunks|  If you want a taste of my juicy apple pie you better be nice. You got that?
Lemongrab|  I am sorry. Make pies, slave.
Tree Trunks|  Okay, that's better, now let's see about this pie business.
Tree Trunks|  All right, gentlemen. Have a look at my luscious, gooey apple pie.
Lemongrab|  No!  Acceptable.
Shelby|  Uh, Lemongrab?
Lemongrab|  WHAT?!
Shelby|  Never mind.
Ice King|  Come on, you guys. That mouse showed us the room door.
Ice King|   Say, you know what's weird?
Neptr|  What, Papi?
Ice King|  Well, isn't it weird how Tree Trunks' ability to make pies is specifically what helped us escape from that room?
Neptr|  I make pies, too, Papi.
Ice King|  Right, yeah, like, battery pies or summin'? 
Neptr|  No. Real pies. Don't you remember? I am your s- 
Ice King|  Hey! Look, another room!
Ice King|  Good grief, it's humid in here.
Lemongrab|  That door will lead us closer to the exit!
Ice King|  Hold up, hold up!  Look! 
Ice King|  There has to be a way to get across without that thing chompin' our WOO-HOOS!
Neptr|  Can't you fly us across, Papi?
Ice King|  Oh yeah, I can sure try.
Ice King|  Nggh! Aw dang, this heat is negating my powers! Can't do nothin' with this steam coming off the water. 
Ice King|  NGH, glob! Fah!  Nagh! Look at this!  Well, that's it. Show's over. I'll just die here and y'all can eat my body if you want to survive.
Tree Trunks|  Golly, how we ever gonna worm our way out of this... fishy situation?
Shelby|  I think I have an idea.
Shelby|  That's a girl, Tree Trunks! You can do it!
Shelby|   This is gonna work out just fine.
Tree Trunks|  Oh, that's warm on my undercarriage.
Ice King|  H-help me guys!
Neptr|  Yes, Papi! 
Ice King|  NNGH! Lemongrab, c'mon!
Tree Trunks|  Bleh! Wow, that was heavy, man.
Tree Trunks|  Aw yeah, I've been reborn!
Neptr|  Look! 
Tree Trunks|  Let's go then!
Neptr|  Papi, no!  Ouchies!
Tree Trunks|  Look out,  Shelby!
Lemongrab|  WOOAH! WUOAGH!
Lemongrab|  OUGHF! MY JUICE!! MY VITAL JUICES!!!
Lemongrab|  MOMMY!!!
Lemongrab|  The hidden door! Hohuugh.. 
Lemongrab|  My vital essence depleted... Must.. replenish...
Tree Trunks|  Oh, step back, you all. 
Shelby|  Ugh!
Ice King|  Ew.
Lemongrab|  Nugh.. That'll do, Slave Trunks. To the spiraling ledge! 
Ice King|  We almost there, Lemongrab?
Lemongrab|  Yes.
Shelby|  Faster, TT!
Tree Trunks|  Don't criticize my running, Shelby.
Lemongrab|  This door leads to the center exit!
Neptr|  The door is secured with an esoteric encryption system.
Ice King|  Well that's okay, 'cause you can hack the mainframe or whatever, right BMO?
Neptr|  I'm not BMO, I'm your son Neptr. I-I throw pies.
Ice King| Ohhhs! I grabbed the wrong robot!  Dang! Nuts face!
Shelby|  Uhhh ... what is going on here Ice King?
Tree Trunks|  Yes, I'm getting a weird feeling in my stomach, and I think it's 'cause of you, Mr. Wizard you'd better fess up to whatever you're doing.  I got no time for nobody dancing around and acting fool at my expense.  I'm Tree Trunks and people know I'm kind and honest, that's why people like me. 
Ice King|  Huh? Wha-wha-what's she sayin'?
Tree Trunks|  So stop sellin' fib-bibs and give it straight! 
Ice King|   Grrrr! All right! I knocked you all out and brought you here!
Ice King|   I'm sorry, but I had to do it. Each of you possess the exact qualities to pass the various tests of this dungeon Tree Trunks with your baking skills;  Lemongrab with your lemony-juicy... 
Lemongrab|  Essence.
Ice King|  Yeah...  Shelby, who should've been the bait for the fish.
Shelby|  Yeah..but no, thanks. 
Ice King|  And..BMO, who should've been here instead of this weird piece of junk that I don't remember nothin' about.  Ahhh, I failed!
Neptr|  Father! Look at me. 
Neptr|  Are you happy with me now, Papi?
Ice King|   Yes! Yes! Oh, my son!  The grand prize of my loins!
Ice King|  Now you see why I needed to bring you all here. Behold! The Ancient Sleeping Magi of Life Giving!
Tree Trunks|  What's it do?
Ice King|  Whatever goes in the Magi's flames..comes to life, anything at all!
Tree Trunks|  Uh, like an ashtray?
Ice King|   Yes! Isn't it amazing?!
Shelby|   Uh..You should've told us! I would've freaking brought something!
Ice King|  Do not be sad. Because I brought the ultimate thing!  This.
Neptr|  Your journal?
Ice King|  Except..it's not my journal!  It's my Fionna & Cake fan-fiction!  All my brilliant fantasies will now be real.  Fionna, Cake, Marshall Lee; they'll all be living, breathing beings, just like me.
Lemongrab|   You serve no function, you must be destroyed!  
Ice King|  Yes! Yes! 
Book|  Woo, hahaha, yeah! 
Ice King|   No..NO! Another cruel joke on my life! 
Ice King|  Oh, good..you're awake, you bum. Look what you did.. Get out of my Face! Yeah, yeah Get out! 
Finn|   This is the spot? Right here?  What was that?!
Tree Trunks|  C'mon Ice Cream. We-we're leavin' 
Jake|   I'm tellin' you dude, my pie-dar's goin' 'nay-nays. 
Jake|  Oww!
Book|  Write in me!
Finn|  What the—This is very strange.
Jake|  TT! Where is the pie at?! 
Tree Trunks|  Oh, Mister Lemoncarb ate it.
Lemongrab|   Bye, don't follow me. 
Shelby|  Hey, Jake can I catch you a ride back home?
Jake|  Yeah, but what the heck is goin' on here? 
Shelby|  Ice King was doin' some... desperate business, but it didn't work out.  He seems pretty bummed out 'bout it.
Neptr|  Don't be sad, Papi. Your characters can always be real in the garden of your mind.
Ice King|   They can? 
Neptr|  Remember when you showed me your imagination zone?
Ice King|  Yes! Yes, if I can concentrate... 
Ice King|   It worked!
Fionna|   I missed you, Ice King!
Ice King|  Oh, Fionna, can dreams be real as waking life?
Fionna|  Of course they can! Dreams are real!
Ice King|  Then I will wait for you, from across the threshold of consciousness.
Neptr|  Our worlds will surely meet, Ice King.
Ice King|   I, too, feel this; and it feels so strong it must be true.
Finn|   Who in this world is sadder than the Ice King?
Shelby|   Me, watching this.
Book|   Yeah! Write it down! Write it down!
Finn| SLAM!
Jake|  Hey! I was trying to read that!
Finn| That book is above your level.
Jake| What business are you into?
Finn| None of your business!
Jake|  Talk about it over lunch?
Finn|  Heh, if you're buying.
Jake|  Hey!
Finn|  Hey!
Finn and Jake|  Fight!
Lumpy Space Princess| Ahh! it's terrible!
Finn, Jake and Princess Bubblegum|  Lumpy Space Princess!
Princess Bubblegum|  Whats wrong?!
Lumpy Space Princess|  You guys! Somebody stole something from me! Something I can't live without! 
Princess Bubblegum|  I'll get something to calm her down. 
Lumpy Space Princess|  I've been robbed! I've been robbed!
Princess Bubblegum|   Out of the way!
Princess Bubblegum|   I need help! Can you guys hold her down?
Lumpy Space Princess|  Do something! I've been- ooh!  Ohh! 
Princess Bubblegum|  Oops.
Finn|  LSP! Who robbed you?
Lumpy Space Princess|   It...was...puh...pee...pete...sa...sas...as...
Princess Bubblegum|  I think I gave her too much.
Finn|  Jake. A crime has been committed. We must find the criminal.
Jake|  We must.
Finn|   And retrieve whatever it is that was stolen from Lumpy Space Princess.
Jake|   Stolen. But all we have to go on is part of a name. Pete something.  Need more clues! Hold me! 
Finn|  Clues, clues, clues.
Lumpy Space Princess|  
Finn|  What's that? I can't see it.
Jake|  Oop, sorry.  Aah!
Finn|  There's something in her hand!  A key! A key to...what? Three zero three. Hmm.
Jake|   Ooh, turn it around! 
Finn|  Ah!  Looks like we've got our first lead!
Finn|  Hmm. Find anything, Jake?
Jake|   Got some bags and...wait-  more bags. But no leads on Pete something.
Finn|   Same here. BMO.  Start marking evidence.
Jake|  Hmm.
Finn|  Hmm.
BMO|   Hmm.
Finn|   Dude, check this!  Is this blood?
Jake|  Yeah man, that's definitely blood.
Finn|  Hmm. LSP's injuries were 100 percent emotional. So it has to belong to Pete Sa-something. BMO, take a sample and do a full blood analysis.  The works.  Hey, if that guy cut himself during the robbery, he might have gone somewhere to buy a mini adhesive bandage. There's a drugstore across the street!
Jake|   Let's roll. 
Finn|  Woah!
Ann|  And if the oozing persists, just come back   and I'll give you something a little stronger.
Finn|   I'm Finn. This is my partner, Jake. 
Jake|  Hello, citizen. Had anyone in here looking to buy some mini adhesive bandages today?
Ann|  A lot of people come through my store, gentlemen. You can't seriously think I'd be able to remember any one particular customer among the countless others I see on a daily basis, now, can you?
Finn|  I guess not. Fair dues. C'mon, Jake.
Ann|   Wait! Now that you mention it, there was this one guy in here earlier. Real suspicious type. Had a nosebleed. Said it was the first one he'd had in years.  Used to get them all the time as a kid, he said.  Can never remember if he was supposed to pinch his nose and hold his head back, or pinch his nose and hold his head forward.  Maybe it was a case of being boxed on the nose too many times.  Made the blood vessels in his lower septum weak and vulnerable to hemorrhaging. Anyway, his mammy always said it was because he couldn't keep all those picky little fingers out of his dirty little nose holes.  He didn't buy it though. He always thought it had-
Finn|  Ma'am, can you give us a name?
Ann|  Mmm, nope. No wait, yes I can. Pete Sassafras.
Finn|  Did you catch which way he was going?
Ann|  Of course! He said he was catching a train at 1127, Candy Kingdom Station, Platform 5. Heh. Sorry, I wish I could remember more.
Jake|  See anyone who might be our guy?
Finn|   Nope.  Nobody's suspicious here. Just a load of decent law-abiding folk.  What the-?! Jake! What's with all the turning into stuff today?
Jake|  I really like turnin' into cop stuff. I literally can't stop turning into cop stuff.  Hey, there's Platform 5!  I see a nasty tranch!
Finn|  Let's book him, son.
Finn|   Stop right there! What's under that skeezy trenchcoat ya-
Blueberry Cop 1|   Crook!  Busted! For attempting to board a train without a ticket.
Finn|  Oh, guys, he's getting away!
Jake|  We're not criminals, man! We're working the beat, just like you!
Blueberry Cop 1|  Jimmy?
Blueberry Cop 2|   Yup. Checks out. He tastes like police.
Blueberry Cop 1|   Sorry about that, officers, it was an honest mistake.
Finn|   Ugh. We lost him.
Jake|  Not yet we didn't! 
Finn|  Ugh! It's too far ahead! We'll never catch it.
Jake|  If we cut through the forest, maybe we can head it off at the pass.
Finn|  Sweet thinkin'.
Finn and Jake|  Yeah!
Finn|  Are you Pete Sassafras?
Pete Sassafras|  Wha-? Uh, I got a lot of names. Who's askin'?
Jake|   Give back what you stole from LSP!
Pete Sassafras|  Who? What's that, an acronym or somethin'?
Finn|  Cuff 'em.
Jake|  Ehh, I got this.  You have the right to remain... busted.
Pete Sassafras|  Alright, you listen, flatfoot. There's been some kind of crazy mistake here. I didn't do nothin'!
Jake|  Save it for the candy judge, Pete.
Finn|  Look, you can cut the act and drop the sass, Sassafras. We've got an eye-witness and your blood at the scene of the crime.
Jake|  You do the crime, you do the time, man!
Finn|  Roll the dice, you pay the price.
Pete Sassafras|  What dice? Oh, you guys are donkers.
Jake|  Burgle our friend, it's the end.  For you!
Pete Sassafras|  I wanna see a lawyer.
Lawyer|  I'll handle this, Pete. You're upsetting my client. Just look at that face. That constitutes harassment, so give him some space. Don't worry buddy, I got this case.
"""Lawyer"""|   Welcome to the next twenty-five years of your life.
Finn|   We deserve donuts.
Jake|  Let's ball. 
Pete Sassafras|  No, wait, please! You guys!
"""Lawyer"""|  Guilty! 
Finn|  Man, we didn't just crack that case, we crunched it! Crumbled it!
Jake|  We are awesome at being cops!  No question about that.
Finn|   Call me crazy, but I was thinking maybe we should actually become detectives. Like, as a job! When we were out on the streets back there, getting those leads, busting that perp, it just felt so...I don't know...right.
Jake|   I know, man. I actually totally do know exactly what you mean.
Finn|   Aw, dude. 
Jake|  I told you I have a problem. I can't stop!
BMO|   Howdy, partner.
Finn|  Oh hey, BMO. What's going on?
BMO|  I finished processing the blood sample. And I have the result.
Finn|  Nice!
Jake|  Yeah, good work, BMO!
Finn|  It's Pete Sassafras's blood, right?
BMO|  No. It doesn't belong to anyone because it's not blood. It's tomato sauce.
Jake|  Tomato sauce?
Finn|"  Hmm...  Oh my mind! LSP wasn't trying to say ""Pete Sa-something""; she was trying to say ""Pizza something!"""
Jake|  But how would pizza sauce end up in a hotel room?
Finn|   Unless it was delivered.
Finn and Jake|  Pizza Sassy's!
Finn|  Where's the delivery guy?!
Man behind the counter|  Oh, you mean Petey. He's out. He's makin' deliveries.
Jake|   Or maybe he's out tying up loose ends!
Finn|   LSP could be in danger!
Jake|  Danger! 
Finn|  Phone?
Man behind the counter|  Phone. 
Finn|   Princess! Have some Banana Guards outside of LSP's hospital room!
Princess Bubblegum|  Huh? Why?
Finn|  LSP could be in danger!
Princess Bubblegum|  LSP woke up and went back to her hotel room.
Finn|   OH MY JAM!!!
Finn and Jake|  He's already here! 
Woman behind counter|  Can I help you?
Finn and Jake|   LSP! 
Lumpy Space Princess|  It was you! You did it!
Petey|  Help me! I was just delivering the pizzas she ordered. And now she won't let me leave.
Finn|  LSP, what is going on? You said he stole something from you.
Lumpy Space Princess|  He did! He stole...my heart! 
Finn|  Hurry up, dude!
Jake|  Shh!
Finn|  Right.
Petey|  Thanks!
Finn|  Shh. Go, go!
Petey|   Yeah, no tip, huh? That's great. That's how it is, around here. Fine.
Jake|   Huh, huh? Come on pal. Turns out the only case here is just another case of LSP being nutty!
Lady Rainicorn|  나 정말 TV 걱정되네. 쟤는 밖에 절대 안 나가잖아. 
Jake| Aw, don't worry about him. It's good to be passionate about your hobbies.
Lady Rainicorn| 으유, 몰라, 난 싫어. 쟨 밖에 나가서 찬 공기 좀 쐬야 돼. 
Jake| Yo, T.V.! Get me a chocolate bar!
T.V.| Okay.
Jake| Attaboy!
T.V.| Ah!
Old Sassy Man| Hello, young man!
Old Man|  Oh.
T.V.| Psych.
T.V.| Delicious chocolate bridge...
T.V.| Yeuch. Huh?
T.V.|  This diary belongs to B.P. Private property.  If you're stilling reading this, you're a bad person.  Uh... statute of limitations.
B.P.| Dear diary. Wow. I sound like a real cornball. Oh, well. Dear diary! Mom is going to love you. She's always ragging about me spending too much time with my nose in books. I wonder what I'm going to write in you. What kind of person will I be when I get to your last page? Will I have my braces off? Will I have written a song that doesn't totally suck? Will I have met a cool guy? ...I can barely look at dudes without breaking out into hives. ...Just another day in teenage purgatory, AKA the school caf. Sloppy joes again. ...Boys I did not talk to today Brownie Guy...
T.V.| Geez, B.P... Prone to dramatics much?
B.P.| The Fire Kingdom has officially frozen over. Justin Rockcandy asked me to the semi-formal!
T.V.| Oh my Glob.
B.P.| Justin... Justin is taking me to the Fructose Fair... Justin... Justin wants to go on the rollercoaster... Kissing is fun and easy, if I don't think about the bacteria in spit teeming, multiplying... Diary, can you keep a secret? ...Justin! ...Justin... Hive of bees in my head, get out! ...Mother, I'm not going to tell you again! ...Lies, lies, lies! ...Diary, it's my birthday tomorrow, but I don't feel like celebrating. I feel like screaming.
B.P.| Justin wants to meet at Love Tree Point. Says he wants to give me a present. I should tell him. I need to tell him. I will tell him!
T.V.|   Tell him what?  Uuuuuugh!
Lady Rainicorn| TV! 아침밥!
T.V.| Not hungs.  Heading out for a bit.
Lady Rainicorn| 쟤좀봐! 
Jake|  There you go, just need a little push from the old man. 
T.V.| I gotta get into the mind of this kid.  Roleplay.
T.V.| Rip, rip!  Ahh! Sploosh! My secret is safe at the bottom of this disgusting moat.
T.V.|  Oh, B.P., what have you done?
T.V.|  I'm sick of the lies. Sick, sick, sick!
T.V.|  Uh, babe, I said I'm sorry?
T.V.|  You don't know me. Nobody knows me, leave me alone!
T.V.| I hate Sloppy Joes!
T.V.| Yuck.
T.V.| Taffi? Mochi!
Taffi| Hey Moch'! Is that the new Nosy Nellies bootleg 7-inch?
T.V.|  Taffi, Mochi, down here!
Mochi| I ordered it from this dude in Lumpy Space.
Taffi| Is it insane?
Mochi| It's almost too insane.
Taffi| Wicked.
Justin| Hiya B.P.! What's up?
T.V.| Justin?
Justin| Guilty as charged.  You psyched for your birthday, birthday girl? Don't forget about our little rendezvous at Love Tree Point, huh? I can't wait for you to see your prezzie. You're gonna be there, right? Please say yes! Please! Please! Please! Please! Please!
Jake| Bam!  Bam!  Bam! Lady, you're really off your game. I never win at canasta!
Lady Rainicorn| TV 가 걱정되서. 얘가 하루 종일 밖에 나가 있잖아. 
Jake| You said you wanted the kid to spend more time outside. Bam--He's outside. He's loving it!
Lady Rainicorn| 너무 어두워지네. 가서 애 뭐 하나 좀 봐. 
Jake| If it'll make you feel better then yes, but I'm sure he's fine.
Jake| Uh-oh.
Jake| Uh, son?
T.V.| Mom?
Jake| Uh, close enough.
T.V.| Get out of my room!
Jake| T.V., what is that?
T.V.|  Private property.
Jake| Gimme the book. 
T.V.| Noooooo!
Jake|  A diary, huh? Juicy.  And now you've become dangerously obsessed with it, and have confused your reality with that of the diary keeper.  You always were a little too susceptible to fantasy.
Jake| Ooh, ripped pages! Mystery.
T.V.| And look how the handwriting changes right before the rip!  The e's are all crabbed. That's weird, right?
Jake| That's super weird, son.
Jake| She was obviously emotionally distraught. Maybe she was so stressed she broke out in hives!
Jake|  And they covered her whole body. So they rushed her to the hospital.
Jake|" She was thinking, ""oh man I'm so young,"" and how life is so unfair, and that this was the end."
Jake| But it wasn't the end. She had pulled through. Except her hand had been replaced with a crab hand!
Jake| Which negatively affected her handwriting.
T.V.| Yeah!
T.V.| And, and, while I recovered, I refused all visitors.
Jake| Wait... you refused?
T.V.| Especially Justin.  How could he love a girl with a crab hand?
T.V.| I mean... that is definitely not normal.
T.V.| Justin sent me flowers every day for a week.
T.V.| Then every other day.
T.V.| Then they stopped coming all together.
T.V.| On my birthday I decided I was going to keep my promise to meet Justin, crab hand or no crab hand. But when I got to Love Tree Point, Justing was already there...
T.V.| ...Making out with my BFFs Taffi and Mochi!
Jake|  He did not!  Well, that's one theory, anyway.
T.V.| Am I unlovable?
Jake| Hey, did you say Love Tree Point? That's where the kids used to go smoochin' back in the day. This diary must be pretty old.
Jake| We should go check it out.
Jake| Ugh, this place is a dump.
T.V.|  Why do they call this Love Tree Point?
Jake| Because of that tree over there.
Jake| Yeah, it's pretty heavy-handed.
T.V.|  On page 42 it says Justin hid a present somewhere around here. Maybe it's in the tree.
Jake| Hey, good thinking!
Jake| Bingo!
T.V.| It's so beautiful...
Jake| Yeah... B.P. would have love this.
Jake| Justin must have been too devastated to reclaim it. Maybe he thinks she'll come back for it one day. 
T.V.|  We've got to find her, Dad!
Jake| She never knew how much she meant to him. To all of us!
Lady Rainicorn| 어으, 놀고들 있네. 
Jake| Y'know, son, I bet I know where this music box is from.
Jake| Maybe they can give us a clue.
Salesman|" Oh, yes. Yes, this is one of mine. From my ""dancing cat"" period. "
T.V.| Do you remember who bought it?
Salesman| Oh, goodness.  It feels like a lifetime ago. I must have made hundreds of boxes since then, each marrying sound and motion to tell a unique story... The dance of the cosmos in miniature.
Jake| Okay...Well, we gotta go.
Salesman|  A young man bought this!
T.V.| Justin! Was he handsome?
Salesman| Oh, very.
Jake| Who was it meant for?
Salesman| A girl. Betsy.
T.V.|  B.P.!
Salesman| She ran away. Went wild, cut herself off from the world, hid away in a cave never to be seen again. 
Jake| Woah.
T.V.| But Dad, there are probably hundreds of caves in--
Salesman| It's the one at the fork in the road to Butterscotch Lake!
Salesman| The box said she does weird stuff to bodies up there.
T.V.| That's it!
T.V.| Why do you think Betsy ran away, Dad?
Jake| Hard to say.  Some people can't face their troubles. But T.V., hiding away won't solve anything.
T.V.| Look!
Jake| Ah, teachable moment.
T.V.| Betsy?
T.V.| Betsy?
T.V.| Betsy... Oh my Glob. We're too late!
T.V.| She was too good for this cruel world. 
Jake| It's a model.
T.V.| Huh?
Jake|" It's plastic.  ""Heeyyy."""
Jake| Hey, look at this!
Jake| Maybe we shouldn't read this...
T.V.| Yes, we should.
B.P.| Dear Justin I'm not sure you'll ever read this letter. Maybe I'm writing this more for myself anyway. You know when you're little, and the future feels really far away? You don't know what it looks like. You just hope you'll have stuff figured out by then. You'll know exactly how to act, and feel. You'll have conquered all your fears. And you'll never feel dumb or uncomfortable. You don't think about how you'll actually get there. The middle parts, between now and then? The middle parts suck. Which is why I split, I guess. Okay, so riding out your teen years in a cave is pretty dramatic, but do you know much reading you get done in a cave? I even figured out a cure for my crab hand!
B.P.| Oh Justin, I hope you're not too upset, and I hope you didn't spend too much money on that birthday present. It wouldn't have worked out between us anyway. You're kind of clingy. Sincerely, Nurse Betsy Poundcake.
Dr. Ice Cream| Nurse Poundcake!
Nurse Poundcake|  I've got the injection, doctor.
Patient|  I'm not gonna  make it, man!
Patient| Gah!
Nurse Poundcake| You will live!
Dr. Ice Cream| Way to take control of the situation, nurse.
Nurse Poundcake| Save it for the post-op, Doc.
Jake| Wow. B.P. is Nurse Poundcake. She turned out fine!
T.V.| But what about the ripped pages?
Jake| Oh, I saw them in the cabin. It was just a lot of mean stuff about Justin.  Hey, that guy must be pretty sad, huh? Hey, you wanna go find him?
T.V.| No.

Older bear|  Hmm... 
Finn|  Cubby, is there anything we can do to help?
Cubby|  You could talk to Party Pat.
Finn|  Party Pat?
Cubby|  He's our chief. If you can convince him to leave, all will follow.
Finn|  Can you take us to him?
Cubby|  Sure. He sleeps on the monster's heart. It's like a blood waterbed.
Cubby|  This is as far as I go. Party Pat is right around this corner. Bye, you guys!
Finn|  Bye, Cubby!
Jake|  Bye!
Finn|  Uhh... we're lookin' for Party Pat?
Finn|  Oh, uh...  Well, listen. I know you don't know us, sir, but we need to talk.
Party Pat|  
Finn|  It's pretty important, actually—
Party Pat|   Shhh-sh-sh-sh-shhhh. You know who I am?
Finn|  You're Party Pat?
Party Pat|   I'm the chief.
Finn|  Riiiight... right.
Jake|  You're the chief.
Party Pat|   Shhhh... before you talk to the chief, you must party with the chief.
Finn|  But—!
Party Pat|  It is the only way.
Jake|  Dude, we've been partyin' for hours.
Finn|   Yeah, he keeps drinking those honey-flavored energy drinks.
Finn|  How's your nausea?
Jake|  Full-blown.
Finn|  Hang in there, pal.  Hey, Party Pat. You're the chief, and I totes respect that... but what we have to tell you is really important. And you said if we partied, we could talk.
Party Pat|  But you haven't been partying.
Finn|  What?!
Party Pat|  You move to music, but that's not dancing. You chew pancakes, but you're not tasting. To truly party, one must leave behind the problems that are troubling  and open one's  mind eye.  I'm just kiddin'. You guys are party animals.  This is just a sticker!  You can stay in our cave as long as you want.
Finn|  That's what I've been trying to tell you, man! This isn't a cave—y'all are partyin' in a monster's BELLY!
Party Pat|   Oh, yeah. That makes sense. It's definitely the weirdest cave I've ever seen. Heh heh.
Finn|  So... you'll tell everyone to leave?
Party Pat|  Nah, we love it here.
Finn|  But you're all gonna die if you stay!
Party Pat|    Attention. Attention, everybody. Can I have your attention, please?  So... apparently we're not in a cave.
Party Pat|  We're in a... MONSTER'S BELLY!
Party Pat|  
Jake|  It's kinda peaceful.
Monster|  
Finn|  All those bears... are gonna turn into the stuff.
Jake|   Shh. Seriously? The only foreseeable threat might be all these trees being swallowed, but they're not hurtin' nothin'.
Finn|  Yeah, good thing he isn't swallowing some deadly volcano lava. That would kill them for sure.
Finn & Jake|  Whoaa.
Finn|  The monster is headed toward that volcano!
Monster|  Uh-huh.
Finn|  We gotta warn the bears!
Finn|  If we bum everyone out, maybe they'll listen to us.
Jake|  Oh, okay.
Finn|  Just follow my lead.
Finn|  You bears gotta get outta here or you're all gonna be melted by lava!
Finn|  Party Pat, do you know of another exit?
Party Pat|  Well, there's the dark and mysterious mine, but nobody uses it anymore.
Finn|   He must be talkin' about the butt intestines! C'mon, Jake, we gotta get outta here!
Jake|   Ehhhhh.
Finn|  One more bandage.
Finn|  Huzzah! The party bears are safe, Party Pat. Y'all can party out here now.
Party Pat|  No. To survive, my people need a phat party club to grind in. That monster's gut was totally excellent.
Jake|  You're sick, Party Pat. I'm gonna go watch TV. 
Finn|  Hmmm. 
Monster|   Ohh...
Finn|  Pat, he's not gonna let you back in his mouth. You scorched it all up with fireworks! Unless... Party Pat!  Party... pancakes.
Party Pat|    Hear me, monster. My people and I wish to party inside you once more. Prithee take us upon thine gut and we shall party no more with fireworks but instead  with gentle lasers!
Finn|  Hey, Jake.  Wait up!
Jake| BMO, I've been playing this 72 hours straight. Can I please save after this battle?
BMO| No, it takes up too much brain space.
Jake|  I'm out of candles. Huh? Man, if Finn were here, we'd be doing this in shifts. Oh, well, let's keep grinding.
BMO| I cannot talk and run this game at the same time.
Jake|  No!  Well, I guess that means I'm free. I live again!
Jake|  ♪My name is Jake, and love my life. Kissin' on lady 'cause she's basically my wife. Fixin' up Neptr 'cause he fell from a tree. Catchin' up with Maja and Aptwe.♪
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant| ♪Maja's in a coma, and she might not wake up.♪
Jake| ♪I'm glad you got a friend now even though that's messed up. Take T.V. to the market to get him into fruits. Take a little nappy in my blanket cocoon... Wake up really early just to cook for my friends. Later in the field at night I thought I saw death. Made myself a boat, and I sailed with a whale. Took T.V. to the market so he could try kale. And some other stuff...♪ Ah!
Shelby| Nice song, Jake.
Jake| What a crazy 2 weeks. I think I'm ready to hole up and go round tow on 'Age of Grinders'. But where's Finn? I need him on this adventure.
Shelby| Uh, well...
Jake| Hold on. What?
Shelby| If you don't know, I'm not sure it's my business to tell you.
Jake| Don't you dare, Shelby! Give up that greasy gossip!
Shelby| Word on the street is, Finn's been hanging with a new lady.
Jake| Who the honk is it?
Shelby| I don't...
Jake| Muscle Princess. It's perfect.
Shelby| I don't...
Jake| Me-Mow, from the future! 
Shelby| Nobody knows. Finn's been keeping this on the super DL.
Jake| Why?
Shelby| He's just trying to be careful this time.
Jake| Oh yeah, I get it. But I still got to know who this girl is.
Shelby| Okay, just don't blow up his spot.
Jake| I won't!
Science Cat| Hey, Jake.
Jake| Oh hey, Science Cat. Where's Sword Shark?
Science Cat| He died of old age. Hey, are you gonna find out who Finn's girlfriend is?
Jake| Who told you that?
Science Cat| Word gets around, man.
Jake| Not to me, apparently.
Science Cat| Let me know the dirt when you find out.
Jake| I won't!
Jake| Huh? What's that? Sounds like a flute coming from above the canopy.
Jake| Huntress Wizard!
Huntress Wizard| Stop!
Huntress Wizard| This isn't working, Finn.
Jake| Dude.
Finn|  Oh, hi, Jake. What are you doing here?
Jake| I wanted to check out your new lady friend, but I guess she just dumped you like a diaper in the dirt, bro.  I'm sorry, man! I want you to have a healthy relationship with someone cool.
Finn| That's so sweet, Jake. I love you, man.
Jake| Me, too, man. Okay, I'm okay.
Finn| But, dude, me and Huntress Wizard weren't together. We're just trying to conjure up the Spirit of the Forest with my flute spell.
Jake| What the blood are you talking about?
Finn| It went down like this.
Finn| I was just minding my own business, in my new alone place I've been hanging out at.
Finn| Hello.
Huntress Wizard| How are you playing like that?
Finn| I don't know. I'm just making stuff up.
Huntress Wizard| Something in your notes has the quality of a powerful evocation spell. What spirit guides your hands? Tell me, or I'll put this up your nose.
Finn| First off, I'm a great fighter. And especially agile when I'm nude, so good luck. Second, my flute improv ain't no secret. I let my grass hand do whatever it wants, which is usually sort of shreddy and busy.
Huntress Wizard| Let me see that hand!
Huntress Wizard| You're what I've been looking for.
Jake| Looking for a dope boyfriend.
Finn| No man. She thinks my grass arm flute playing could summon the Spirit of the Forest. I've been playing different songs for 2 weeks, though, and he hasn't shown up yet.
Jake| Who's that, her ex-boyfriend?
Finn| Uh, I guess they used to hang out, but maybe in some kind of mentor-student capacity.
Jake| So my theory holds. You can still make this happen.
Finn| Yeah, I really want to help her summon this dude.
Jake| Finn, that's not why you're here.
Finn| That's why I'm here.
Jake| Come on. Let's make some magic happen.
Finn| Yeah, my magic flute spell.
Huntress Wizard| Finn. I had an idea.
Jake| Hi.
Huntress Wizard| I think the problem is your flute. We should make you a better one from a magical tusk, like the tusk of the legendary Thunder Boar that lives in these woods.
Finn| I'm down for whatever if it helps.
Jake| I'm also here.
Huntress Wizard| Hey, what's up? It's late. Why don't you guys crash at my place tonight? We'll start the hunt first thing in the morning.
Jake| Ha-ha! I'm like your sleepover chaperone.
Finn| Grow up.
Jake| You grow up, you teen.
Huntress Wizard| So, yeah, here's the place. We got some nice soft dirt right over here. Pantry, in case you want a snack, bathroom. I got a console if you get bored, but it was a gift, but it was a gift, so I haven't really set it up yet. Night, boys.
Jake| Dude, I think I figured it out. You can't summon the Spirit of the Forest 'cause you ain't playing that flute for him. You got a crush on HW.
Finn| HW's just training me to live an ascetic life like her.
Jake| Okay, I buy that for like zero seconds.
Huntress Wizard| Before we hunt the Thunder Boar, you should drink from this enchanted spring. It might give you crazy dreams, but when you wake up, you'll be immune to the Boar's electrical attacks.
Finn| Let's roll those dice.
Jake| Hey, dude, are you sure you wanna do that?
Finn| I've had plenty of weird dreams... Oh-okay! That was fast.
the Spirit of the Forest| Welcome. I am the Spirit of the Forest.
Finn| Wow, dude, we've been trying to summon you for weeks.
the Spirit of the Forest| And why do you seek me?
Finn| I don't, personally, but Huntress Wizard really wants to talk to you, man.
the Spirit of the Forest| Did you know that a wolf's eyes are on the front of its head?
Finn| But, yeah, didn't you guys used to hang?
the Spirit of the Forest| Most predatory species are like that. This little buddy doesn't even know I'm here.
Finn| Fella, I don't want to have a science talk right now.
the Spirit of the Forest| Huntress Wizard only sees straight ahead, eyes on the prize. Now, why did you really need to see me?
Finn| Oh, yeah! Can you make me immune to electricity?
the Spirit of the Forest|  Here.
Finn| Whoa.
the Spirit of the Forest| Now plunge that into your heart.
Finn| And this will give me immunity to electricity?
Finn| I'll do it. To help Huntress Wizard.
Finn| How long was I out?
Jake| Seven long harrowing seconds.
Huntress Wizard| Hold still.
Finn| Yeah, fells fine.
Huntress Wizard| Great. Now we can hunt down the Thunder Boar.
Finn| Oh, yeah, the Boar.
Huntress Wizard| Try to stay focused.
Huntress Wizard| Magic dog, what do you smell?
Jake| Mostly, Finn, but also some kind of giant wild pig.
Finn| There!
Finn| Jake's joking. I smell fine.
Huntress Wizard| Good work.
Thunder Boar| You just wanted a tusk? You could have asked!
Finn| Oh.
Huntress Wizard| You can stop. He is not coming. He is gone for good, and I should just deal.
Finn| Maybe if I played it a little jazzier, like, all syncopated?
Jake| Hey! Why don't you tow try playing together? Use that chemistry to guide the music. Yeah, just get in there. Cozy up.
Huntress Wizard| I guess we've tried everything else.
Jake| Wow...
the Spirit of the Forest| Who summons me with the sweet song of longing? Oh, hey-oh. Can you see me now?
Huntress Wizard| Yes.
the Spirit of the Forest| How's it been going?
Huntress Wizard| I've been talking to a lot of twigs. Where have you been, dude?
the Spirit of the Forest| I've been right here, but the forces that drew us close became obscured as you drifted into the lifestyles of magic city livin'. Attracting forces come and go. It's the way of the world.
Jake| I still can't tell if you guys dated.
Huntress Wizard| But I'm ready to come back now.
the Spirit of the Forest| Are you, though?
Jake| That's what I'm saying.
the Spirit of the Forest| Finn, who was your flute spell for?
Finn| Um... I was playing my flute for you the whole time, but I knew you had a thing with this dude, and he seems cool, so I was just gonna keep playing this flute song about my secret feelings until my flute broke.
Huntress Wizard| I-uh, I worry that hard meat don't get eat. That is to say, if I ever find what I'm looking for, I'll become soft and I'll cease to matter in this world.
Jake| What?
Huntress Wizard| Fear of softness is waht drove me to the mad and sad world of wizarding. And Finn...
Finn| Yeah, what?
Huntress Wizard| My flute spell was for you, too. You're an exceptional beast, and you have great hair. But exceptional beasts like us cannot fall in love. That is the secret of ordinary people.
Jake| Uh, that's real dumb.
Finn| I agree.
Jake| Wait, you agree with me or her?
Finn| Take it easy, Huntress Wizard.
Finn| Man, I can't believe all you can do is upgrade your armor in this game.
Jake| It's all about patience and treating each grueling repetitive battle as if it were your first.
Finn| Oh, snap! Finally!
Both Finn and Jake| Whoo! Blah!
Finn| What a bad and boring game. It was just what I needed.
Jake| I'm sorry it didn't work out with Huntress Wizard. She just needs time to miss how cool you are.
Finn| Attracting forces come and go, man.
Finn| Oh. Heh heh. What? Where are we?
Jake| I dunno.
Finn| What did we do last night?
Jake| Mayhaps we drank juice of the Elder Toad.
Finn| Eh, I doubt it. Yo, do you see this? We're in a cage! Do you think we, like, did something wrong?
Jake| Yeah, right. When did we ever did wrong actions? Get real. 
Finn| Who ya calling?
Jake| I'm callin' BMO, see if he knows what happened.  Junk... My new camera phone... Wait, c'mere!
Finn| What?
Jake| I guess I vid-taped a buttload of stuff on here.
Finn| Play it for the clues within.
Jake| Okay, play. 
Finn| Did you take it yet?
Jake| Recording.
Finn| Okay, get a shot of the portal.
Finn| Gonna go through this biz!
Jake| Alright, let's do—
Finn| Oh, no! What?!
Jake| Battery crunked out.
Finn| Dude, do you remember any of that mess?
Jake| No, but I guess we're here on purpose?
Finn| So we opened a portal to somewhere, but where? 
Nightosphere Jailer| The Nightosphere.
Finn & Jake|  AHHHhhhh...
Nightosphere Jailer| You're in the Nightosphere.
Finn| Are you sure?
Nightosphere Jailer| Uh, yes. You got thrown in jail. Look. 
Jake| Look!
Finn| Marceline's dad! We really are in the Nightosphere!
Nightosphere Jailer| Up an' at em, people.  Eveyone out of your cages. My shift is over, and no one's shown up, so...
Finn| Whoa, wait. You're letting us go?
Nightosphere Jailer| I mean... yeah, but not really. You're in the nightosphere, so...
Finn| So what?
Jake|  Is there an outlet somewhere for this?
Finn| Hey, c'mon! Just tell us how we can get back to our world.
Nightosphere Jailer| You can't leave the Nightosphere. Not unless he let's you. 
Finn & Jake| Marceline's dad.
Nightosphere Jailer| Yeah, that's Hunson Abadeer. He runs this place.
Jake| Hunson Abadeer?  Alright.
Finn| Well, dude, how do we talk to him?
Nightosphere Jailer| You can't just talk to the boss. You gotta make an appointment.
Finn| Yeah, but we don't even know why we're here!
Jake|  And what's up with this?
Nightosphere Jailer| Ugh. Oh! Oh, oh, sick! You touched that stuff?!
Nightosphere Jailer| Later, fools. 
Jake|  Hey! Hey! Is there an outlet anywhere? You guys...
Finn| Maybe this is where they put all the dummy demons.  Right, big guy? You're not so smart, right? Yeah...  Let's go out that hole, man.
Jake| Okay, get on.
Finn| Mm-hm, mm-hm. Pretty neat.
Finn| Whoa, look!
Demon dad|  Charlie, don't socialize with the smaller demons! They're dirty and stupid!
Charlie| Daddy!
Finn| What is that?
Jake| I think it's like sentient blood mist.
Finn| Cool.
Jake| C'mon, let's see if anyone knows where Hunson Abadeer is.
Finn| Alright, well, how about that dude? 
Jake| Okay.
Finn|  Yo, bros! How do we talk to Hunson Abadeer?
Half Monster Demon|  The teller can help you. Get in my flipping belly, and I will transport you. My insides are habitable. You will not be digested.
Finn| Bye, mister!  Who's the teller? That guy? 
Boat Demon| Okay, bozos, make room, make room, make room!
Small Demon| Ouch! Come on!
Boat Demon| Scooch over, fatty.
Small Demon| I can't, dude. This outbox is packed tighter than my tummy tunnel when I can't make brown on the camping trips because of my anxieties and I have IBS also.  Ow!
Finn| Hey, guy, are you the teller?
Boat Demon| No, no, no, this is the line to meet the teller.
Finn| No, man, are you for real? How long's the wait?!
Boat Demon| I dunno. I just like to row around on top of their heads.
Finn| Bunk that!
Jake|  Hey, do you know about this?
Boat Demon| I... ew, no.  Sick.
Finn| Why do we need to see the teller anyway? We just wanna see Hunson Abadeer and find out what happened to us!
Boat Demon| The teller will get you in touch with Hunson Abadeer. We got systems down here. You gotta swim the proper channels, ya know?
Small Demon| Youse ain't special! Youse gotta wait just like the rest of youse...  Us.
Finn|  Where's the line start?
Boat Demon| Oh... I dunno. The thing sorta governs itself.
Finn & Jake|  Tight!
Finn & Jake| Ow!
Jake|  That guy stinks.
Finn|  Excuse me! Excuse me! Big man? Over here!
Big Demon| Huh? What, me?
Finn| Uh, yeah, how long have you been in line for?
Big Demon| How... long? 
Finn| Oh, butt traps. Jake, stretch us to the front.
All demons| NO CUTTING!!!
Big Demon| I will kill you with all my hopes and regrets!
Finn| All right, dudes, chill! We'll wait! 
Finn| I can't feel my legs.
Finn| SAY SOMETHING!! Say something to me!!!
Jake| I... can't. I got nothing to say anymore.
Finn| Just make up words then!
Jake| Bloobity bloo bloo blah blee blee blah. Shree shrah...
Jake| Hey, check it out. We're at the front of the line.
Finn & Jake| Woohoo!
Finn|  Yo, yo! We wanna talk to Abadeer!
Teller| Wha... Huh?  When your thingy comes up, Hunson Abadeer will see you through the door.
Finn|  42 million?! What's the number on the door?
Jake| 41 million...  We're next! Whew! Man, I thought I was gonna throw up!
Finn| That's us!
Jake| Yaaay!  Nooooooo!
Finn| I'm gonna lose it! Waaaaaaaaaaahhh... 
Jake| Hey, do you know if there's an outlet anywhere?
Two-headed Demon| No.
Jake| Do you know what this is all about? 
Two-headed Demon| No... gross.
Jake| What's going on, buddy? You givin' up?
Finn|  I guess.
Jake| You don't wanna just stick it out a little more?
Finn| I don't know if my little boy heart can take it.
Jake| Listen, Finn. Are you listening?
Finn| Mm-hmm.
Jake| Your heart may be small, but it's strong as a bull donk. And I know. You can wait through this line so we can meet Hunson Abadeer and find out why we're here, and why we're in a pile of banianials, 'cause you're a champ, OK?
Finn|  Ok.
Jake| 上手で頑張ってね 
Finn| Well, at least I can see the end of the line, I think. Let's wait the heck out of this line!
Jake| That's it, champ.  Hehehehe, you're pretty pumped up.
Finn| I'm super pumped!
Cloud| Does anyone need to go pee-pees?
Cloud| Go ahead.
Finn| Oh, yeah, we've got questions.
Jake|  Put your hand down, Finn!
Finn| No way, dude, I got questions.
Finn| What the hey, Jake!
Jake| It's not answering questions, man. That thing is gonna bake our beans.
Finn|  Hey, bloodmist cloud! What happened to us? Why can't we remember any—? Oh, it's gone.
Jake|  Look.
Jake| Ride me, partner. 
Finn| Hey, cloud! Where's Abadeer? Whoa, look at all these paintings. I think this is Hunson Abadeer's house.
Hunson Abadeer| Hey!
Finn| Hunson Abadeer!
Hunson Abadeer| How dare you chumps trespass here!
Jake| We just wanna go home, man.
Finn| Yeah, why'd you lock us up, Abadeer? When Marceline finds out about this, it's gonna stir up some heavy daddy-daughter issues.
Hunson Abadeer| NO ONE LEAVES THE NIGHTOSPHERE!
Jake| Ah, come on, man!
Hunson Abadeer| NO ONE! NO ONE LEAVES THE NIGHTOSPHERE!
Hunson Abadeer| Come with me, you juicy, little mortal soul!
Jake| Finn!
Finn| Oh, my lob, Jake! You found the portal!
Jake| We don't want to hurt you, Abadeer. Just let us go.
Finn| What the—?
Finn & Jake|  MARCELINE?!
Marceline| I'm gonna close this portal.  You're forbidden to come back to the Nightosphere!
Finn| But Marcy, let us help you!
Marceline| It's too late! Stay away from me, FOREVVVEEERRRR!!!! 
Finn| Marceline's in trouble! We gotta go back and save her.
Jake| Alright, but I'm gonna take a shower first.
Finn|  Jake! Jake!  Jake?  Hmmm... 
Jake|  Aaaah!  Aaaaah!  Bl-bl-bl-bl-bl!  Uh! That sounded horrible, man! 
Finn| I don't know how to play.
Jake| Exactly! 
Finn| Huh? Let's go! 
Jake| Oh, wait up. I gotta finish tuning my viola.
Finn| Soft People! Why are you all in a tizzy?
Soft Person #1| The Gut Grinder! He's back!
Finn|" The ""Gut Grinder?"""
Old Soft Person| Yes, the Gut Grinder is a gold-eating monster. In the past, the Soft People of this village enjoyed piling our gold in the center of town and dancing wildly around it. It was awesome ! But then, the Gut Grinder came and stole our pile of gold. So we adapted and learned how to hide our gold using a big cup. And it worked! The Gut Grinder didn't come back! But recently, and admittedly it was probably a bad idea, we took our gold out from under the cup and we put it in the center of town. Haha, 'cause--'cause we really like dancing around it! But, boy oh boy, was that a mistake. You know what happened?
Finn| Uhhh... it came back and ate all your gold?
Old Soft Person|  Yes, oh, yes!
Finn| Aw, don't cry, Soft Old Man. I'll find this monster and bring peace to this village. I swear!
Soft Person #1| Swear to what?
Finn| I swear to justice!
Soft People| Whoa! He swears to justice!
Finn| Okay, so, what does he look like?
Old Soft Person| Ohh, it's so scary we usually close our eyes and go wee-wee when he attacks. But...  he left this footprint...  storms in] Wha--?
Jake|  Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
Soft Person #1| Look! His paw matches the footprint!
Soft Person #1| I'm so scared, I'm gonna go wee-wee!
Finn| Whoa, no, no-no-no-no! Calm down, everybody. This is my friend, Jake the Dog.
Soft Person #2|  Thank goodness.
Soft Person #1| Yeah--I almost wee-wee'd!
Jake| Wait, you were gonna wee-wee if I was the Gut Grinder?
Soft Person #1| Oh, yeah! We're terrified of him.
Jake|  Then I am the Gut Grinder!
Soft Person #1| I'm gonna wee-wee! 
Finn|  That guy wee-wees weird.
Jake| I'm just kiddin', everybody. I'm not the Gut Grinder. I'm...  Jake the Dog! Woohoo!
Soft Person #3| Aw, he's just a cute little dog!
Jake| Hey, I'm not cute!
Soft Child|  Doggy!  Pet, pet, pet! 
Jake| Huh? Oh, heheh. 
Finn| Pfft.
Jake| What?!
Finn| I didn't say anything.  People of the village of Soft People, I, Finn, and my buddy Jake, will find this monstrous monster and slay it!
Finn| Come on, let's go, Jake.
Jake|  Oh... heheh. What? No!  Noooo...
Soft Child| Bye-bye, doggy!
Jake|  Bye, Soft Village.
Jake| Hey Finn, my feet fit these prints pretty well. Hm, what if I really am the Gut Grinder? 
Finn| Dude, your paws'll fit anything.
Jake|  That is true. Check this out.  I'm Finn the Human and I stink at viola!
Finn|  I'm Jake the Dog and I put my nose in poop.
Jake| There's a lot of interesting smells in poop.
Finn| Huh? 
Finn| Hey Cube People, what's going on here?
Cube Person #1| The Gut Grinder stormed into our village and ate all of our gold!
Jake|  Wait, what happened?
Cube People| Aaah! The Gut Grinder!
Finn| Whoa, no, no, no! He's not the Gut Grinder! He's my friend!
Cube Person #2| We saw the Gut Grinder and he looks exactly like him!
Jake|  Th-that's ridiculous.
Finn| Jake, back to your normal size.
Jake| Oh yeah.  Ooh ooh ooh.  I am not... the Gut Grinder. Ooh ooh-ooh ooh-ooh ooh.
Cube Person #1| Aw, he's just a cute little dog.
Jake| Hey! Y'all are the ones who are cute. I'm hot.
Cube Person #1| Aw, look--he's all mad!
Cube Person #2| Even cuter.
Jake| Aaah!
Cube Person #1|  So cute!  Aw, so cute, so cute!
Jake| I'm not cute! I'm--mnh,  ooh.
Finn| We are also seeking the Gut Grinder. Me and my friend Jake will find it and slay it! Tell us what he looked like.
Cube Person #2| Exactly like him,  but bigger.
Jake|  Ruff, ruff, grrrr... 
Finn| Huh... Which way did he go?
Finn| Jake! Hey, come on!
Jake| Wha--?  Where am I?
Finn|  Thanks, guys!
Jake|  I'm not cute. I'll mess you up.
Jake| Finn...? What if I am the Gut Grinder?
Finn| What?!
Jake| What if I'm, like, stealing gold in my sleep?
Finn| You can't be stealing gold in your sleep--I watch you while you sleep.
Jake| Wha--? Yo, Finn, that is creepy, man.
Finn| I can't help it. I take pictures.
Jake| Well, when do you sleep?
Finn| Justice never sleeps.
Jake| Well, there's gotta be a time when you're not watchin' me... that--that I--that I might be stealin' gold unconsciously!
Finn|  You... are... not... the... Gut... Grinder!
Alarm| City in danger! City in danger!
Finn| Let's go! Oh, wait--what if these guys think you're the Gut Grinder? Hmm...  Ah-ha!  Got the perfect thing for ya  Groucho glasses! 
Jake| I love it!  Launch in 3, 2, 1! 
Finn| Woohoo! Yeah!
Finn| Oh, man! These people are a mess!
Spiky Guard| Halt! Identify yourselves immediately!
Finn| I am Finn the hero!
Jake|  I'm Groucho!
Finn| We're on a mission to catch the Gut Grinder.
Spiky Mayor| I am the mayor of this village. Our gold has just been stolen by the very monster you speak of.
Finn| I hereby vow to catch that thief and bring your gold back!
Spiky Mayor| Our people thank you. I present to you this photo  of the Gut Grinder to help in your mission.
Finn|  Oh, thanks.
Jake|  Wha--?  Finn, it's me!
Finn|  Well, duh, it looks like you.  We already knew that. It's just one of those weird coincidences--like how my belly button looks like your face.
Jake| Yeah, I-I know you think it does, Finn--but this is different. I'm scared, Finn. 
Finn| Jake, stop it!
Spiky Mayor| Wha--? Oh, it's the Gut Grinder!
Finn| No, no-no-no-no! He's not the Gut Grinder! I swear on my good name... and justice... and Jake's cute face!
Spiky Mayor| His face is weird. The truth is obvious your friend is the Gut Grinder!
Finn| NOOOOOO!
Spiky Mayor|  You are under arrest for stealing our gold.
Finn|  I'll get you out of here... somehow.
Jake| No, Finn... I belong behind bars. Look at the evidence--I really am the Gut Grinder.
Finn| Buddy, listen to me. You've been my best friend for as long as I can remember! That's enough evidence to prove to me that you're not a monster!
Jake| Then... why am I in jail? Only Gut Grinders go to jail.
Old Man Prisoner| I'm in jail and I'm not the Gut Grinder.  I'm here for the free grub.  Hehehehehe! 
Finn| Huh? Wait, I got an idea!
Finn| Hey, Gut Grinder! I got some gold here that you missed. Come and get it!
Finn| Huh. Whoa, you're the Gut Grinder?
Old Man Prisoner|  Oh, Gut Grinder. Oh, Gut Grinder... you're a little cutesy. You're a little cutesy-wootsy.
Jake| Huh? Grrrr... not cute.  Am I the Gut Grinder?  All the clues fit!  I must be the Gut Grinder!  And I want GOLD!
Finn|  Woohoo! Yeah! We got him! Thanks for saving me, Jake!
Jake|  Grrrr! I'm not Jake--I'm the Gut Grinder! Now give me that gold tooth!
Finn| What? Jake?  Whoa!
Finn|  Whoa!
Jake|  Rawr! Now give me that tooth!
Finn| If I give you this stupid tooth, will you stop being a crazy jerk?!
Finn|" What the--? Jake! You never turn into a monster when I want you to. It's always, ""Not now, Finn. I have a headache."" Oh, Jake,  your viola is all I have now. "
Jake|  Huh?  Ah, stay away from my viola!
Finn| Jake, you remember your viola!
Jake|  I also remember that you stink hard at playing it. And dookie is radical, man! I don't care what anyone says.  Wha--huh? What? Where am I? Finn, is that you?
Finn| Who else would it be, baby?
Jake| Whoo!  I guess I went nuts.
Finn| You were so crazy, man! Like--like, actually crazy.
Finn|  It's good to have you back.
Jake| It's good to have you pat my back.
Finn|  Man, if I had known you were so easily manipulated, I would have eaten more of your ice cream.
Jake|  Cut it out!
Spiky Person| Cut open the Gut Grinder's belly!
Spiky Mayor| What the--?  What the--? Sharon, what are you doing in the Gut Grinder?
Spiky People|  That's the mayor's wife!
Spiky Mayor|  And the Gut Grinder's skin is not skin at all--it's cloth! Sharon! Have you been sewing?!
Sharon|  Yes, Cameron. I've been stealing gold.
Spiky Mayor| WHY, SHARON?!
Sharon| Because I like to buy things, Cameron! I like to shop! And I dressed up like Jake because I think he's hot.
Spiky Mayor| You have been a naughty girl, Sharon.  Guards! Throw my wife in jail.  Finn and Jake, thank you for saving my Spiky Village.
Finn|  No problem, mayor.
Spiky Mayor| Now give us a hug.
Finn| No, don't do that! Don't hug us!  Don't touch me! AAAAAAAAAH!
Jake| Ow! Hey! Don't touch us! OWWWW!
Jake|  Ready?
Flame Princess|  Yes
Jake|    
Flame Princess|   
Finn|  That was awesome! Alright, alright, my turn.    
Flame Princess|   
Finn|  
Flame Princess|   You guys are full of magic air.
Jake|   
Finn|   Gross!   No!  Princess? You, okay?
Flame Princess|   Yeah... It's just the air smells bad from your magic tricks, and now I feel sad.  I left all my scented candles at the castle. They'd really cut through the magic stink.
Jake|  Just go back to the Fire Kingdom and get 'em. Problem solved.
Flame Princess|    Then I'll have to see my dad. I'm still mad at him for imprisoning me in that lantern. So UNFAIR!  
Finn & Jake|  
Finn|  Uh, we can go get 'em.
Flame Princess|"    Really? That would be really nice.  But don't let my Pops see you. I don't want ""His Majesty"" thinking I need anything from him."
Flambo|  
Finn, Flame Princess, & Jake|  
Jake|  That ain't me.
Finn, Flame Princess, & Jake|  
Finn & Jake|  Whoa!
Flambo|   
Finn & Jake|  
Finn|  
Flambo|  Oh!

Finn|  Flambo, we need you to cast Flame Shield on us.
Flambo|   Alright!  
Jake|  
Finn & Jake|  
Finn|"  These candles, must be ""They."""
Jake|    They smell like an old lady's bathroom.
Finn|   Hey! Don't disrespect my lady!
Jake|   I said that as a compliment. Like, it reminds me of grandma. I love my grandma.
Finn|  
Furnius|  No one comes-sss here. Not since Flame Princess  leaved  the castle. Now guesssss what we're gonna kill Flame King with?
Finn|    A conspirator with a hiss voice!
Torcho|  How about, water?
Furnius|  Even worsssse, we'll use icccce.
Finn|   And a conspirator with an untied shoe.
Torcho|  Ice? Why ice?
Furnius|  Cuz it'sss more painful, You sssimpleton! Cold as iccce fallzz. A perfect death for the Flame King.
Furnius & Torcho|  
Finn|  
Jake|  Whoa!

Furnius|  And most of actual murdersss...
Finn|   You hear that? It sounds like a voice with a hiss.
Jake|  The kind we are looking for.
Furnius|  The ssserpent that isss...
Finn|  Stop!
Furnius|  ...my father's life, now wears his crown. 
Finn & Jake|  
Jake|  Dude, the voice
Finn|  We must follow the voice
Jake|    
Unknown|  To die, to sleep; To sleep perchance to dream...
Finn|   Which way is the hiss voice coming from?
Unknown|  ...there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what...
Jake|   This way!
Unknown|  ...dreams may come.
Jake|  
Finn|   Which way?
Furnius|  I seem to be saying a lot about our  super secret plan
Jake|   To the left

Jake|   I'm okay. I think I hear that hissing voice down this way!
Finn|   Whooooo!   Why didn't you catch me?
Jake|  Whoops. Tell me next time, I can't think in the future.
Jake|   Vent ahead.
Finn|   Jake, I wanna see. 
Lesser Flame Guard 3|    Thirty-seven...  Twenty-two

Jake|   Vent

Jalapeño pepper|  What partner? What are you blueberries...?
Red snake|  
Jalapeño pepper|  ...talking about?
Finn|   Give it up man!  I heard your hiss voice!
Jalapeño pepper|  I don't have a hiss...
Red snake|  
Jalapeño pepper|  ...voice.  There's a....

Theater troupe|  
Theater troupe leader|  Five minutes are closing everyone, five minutes.
Finn & Jake|  
Finn|  I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Jake|  
Finn & Jake|  
Jalapeño pepper|    Oh. Psh, actors.
Finn|   What's going with the costumes?
Theater troupe member|   This is a theater troupe. We're getting rrready to perform for the king. Everyone in the kingdom shall be in attendance.  Of course, you know all this being fellow actors from the exact same troupe. 
Jake|   I have an idea. We'll go on stage, act like two conspirators, you will have one shoe untied, I'll talk with a hiss voice, we'll talk about how we want to kill the king, as we do these, we'll study the faces of the audience, a move of guilty reactions.
Finn|   That's brilliant!
Jake|  Thanks! It's an original idea, by me.
Audience|  
Finn|   Hey conspirator!
Jake|  Hey co-conspirator!
Finn|  Let's talk about how we're gonna kill the king.
Jake|  Shhhhhh sssssomebody might here our evil plot.
Flame King|   Man, I am so lost.
Jake|  Psst, the audience.
Suspect|   
Jake|  You think that's one of them.
Finn|  Maybe, let's keep goin'. So, what are you packin'?
Jake|  Water, man. Enough of it to put out the King's fire.
Suspect|    
Finn|  I thinks he's starting to crack. Water? You know what is more painful, if we pour ice in his ear. That's how we'll kill the Flame King.
Flame King|   Psh, kill the Flame King?    This is treason disguised as a play!  Guards, seized them!
Flame Guards|  
Finn|  What!? No!
Flame Guards|  
Finn & Jake|  
Finn|  Please, we were trying to warn you about the assassins!
Flame King|  Hmmmmm, search them!
Flame Guard|  Hmmmm,  Huh?  Sire! It's your daughter's scented candles.
Finn|  Ahh... ahh, ah.
Flame King|  Sickos!  Off with their heads!
Jake|  Whoa, what!?

Audience|

Flame King|  Wa-wa-wait, wait. That voice.  Guards, take off their hoods.
Torcho|  Here, my identity!
Furnius|  
Torcho|   Argh
Flame King|   Furnius and Torcho!
Furnius|  Hello Uuuncle!
Audience|   Wait, what!?
Flame King|   Arrest the executioners!
Flame Guards|  
Flame King|  Hmmmm,  I thought I had you two extinguished.
Furnius|  You cannot quench the flamessss of revenge!
Torcho|  You snucked on our father to become king!
Flame King|  Oh, yeah! Hehe.  Take them to the punishment room!
Flame Guards|  
Furnius|  I'll dessstroy all of you, with ice!
Torcho|  Release me!
Finn|  Wait! So, you? You extinguished their dad?
Flame King|  
Finn|  And everyone is evil here?
Flame King|  
Flame King|   All evil.
Finn|  Then, is Flame Princess evil or maybe chaotic neutral?
Flame King|  She's evil.
Finn|  Okay, so your daughter's evil. We've established that, but do you think if a good guy really liked her, could he, change her to good?
Flame King|  Hmmmmm, well, there'd be penalties to her experience, if she acted out of alignment. But, yes, someone could change her.
Finn|  
Finn & Jake|  
Flame King|   Change her to good? 
Finn|  Aww...
Flame Princess|  
Jake|   
Flame King|   Evil, evil, evil, evil, evil.... EVIL!!!
Flame Princess|   Aah!
Flame King|  Aah!
Flame Princess|  
Finn|   Hm!  Whoa! 
Ice King|  Marceline! Marceline! I'm open, I'm wide open! Marceline, I've got ups! Check out my ups!
Marceline|  Uh! Nope! Ha-ha, too slow!
Jake|  Whoa! 
Ice King|  Ha-ha! Yeah, alright! Good game, good game! Take 5!  I'll get us all a bunch of little waters.
Finn|   Marceline, why did you ask ancient chumps to play basketball?
Jake|  Yeah!
Marceline|   Well, he's very dear to my heart. I love him.
Jake|  What you are talking about, Marceline?
Marceline|  We've been around for a long time, we have a long history together. It's... it's a long story.
Finn|  Lay it on us!
Jake|  Yeah, lay it out, Marcy!
Ice King|  Yeah! Lay down, Marceline, go to sleep! Right? What are we talking about?
Marceline|  Alright, I suppose it's about time I told someone this story.
Simon|  Huh.
Marcy|  Hmmmmmm...
Simon|   Ha-ha! Might be something in here, Marceline!
Marcy|   E-e-ewww! It's a dead rat!
Simon|  Hey! Yeah, so it is, looks like we've got a cute new traveling buddy.
Marcy|  Ewww, noooooooo!!
Simon|   It's kinda cute... 
Simon|   Hey, check it out, it's a VHS tape. You wanna watch a movie?
Marcy|  Yeah!
Simon|  ...Man, this is a boring movie.
Simon|  I like the book much better! 
Marcy|  You're so silly, Simon!
Simon|  He-he-he, yeah, I suppose so... Huh?
Marcy|  What is that?   
Simon|  I'm not sure, but it's coming our way. Come on.  Marcy, you stay in the car. I'll be right back.
Marcy|  Simon! 
Simon|  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Marcy|  You're not going to put it on, are you?
Simon|  I have to. To protect us.
Marcy|  But you're gonna act weird again!
Simon|  Don't worry, I can control it better now.
Marcy|   Mmm...
Simon|  It's okay! B.R.B.  Oh, boy. Here it comes. Oh, bread balls. Oh, bread balls! OH, BREAD BALLS!  I call upon the power of ice and snow!! Ice winds, blow!!!  Rragh! YOU WILL NO LONGER TERRIFY A 47-YEAR-OLD MAN AND A 7-YEAR-OLD GIRL! 
Marcy|   Simon, stop! It's frozen!
Simon|  Not now, Gunther, I'm doing big people things. Come play in the snow, build me a snowman. 
Marcy|  Bleh! 
Simon|  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-- Huh? 
Marcy|  Simon! Simon, are you okay?!
Simon|  Uh...uh...yeah.
Marcy|  You're getting worse, Simon. Your hair and your nose are longer, and you started to hover in the air!
Simon|  Oh, yeah. Did I look pretty...FLY?! 
Marcy|  What are you talking about? You're scaring me.
Simon|   I'm sorry. Did I say something?
Marcy|  Simon, promise me you won't put it on again.
Simon|   OK. I promise.
Marcy|  What is that thing?
Simon|  It's a deer.
Marcy|  If there are deers in the forest, do you think there are other things?
Simon|   I don't know.  Hm...  Uhh! This is gonna be good. It's gonna be worth it.  Use the remote to turn on the T.V. 
Simon|    ♪ Making your way in the world today, takes everything you got. ♪
Marcy|  
Simon|  ♪ Taking a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot. Sometimes you want to go, where everybody knows your name! ♪
Marcy|  What is this?
Simon|  Filmed before a live studio audience.  Norm!
Marcy|  Mute.
Marcy|  
Simon|   Marcy...?  Oh, no... Uh, you're fine. Just a bit warm, but you should get some sleep. 
Marcy|  Hey! Good morning! I made you breakfast! It's mostly pine needles and deer guts.
Simon|   Oh, you're even worse.  I mean, don't freak out or anything, but we need to get you some... chicken soup!  There you go.  There must've been a soupery in that town, but I don't want you walking all...  ...that way.  Okay. You ready for a motorbike ride?
Marcy|  Mmm-hmm.
Simon| Okay, now we're talking.  Just needs a little love-- 
Marcy|  AAH!
Simon|  WOWZERS! 
Simon|  Okay, let's try something else.
Simon|  Hey, Marcy, I wrote a song for you. 
Marcy|   Your songs are sooo good.
Simon|  Here we go!  Aw, it's locked.  Vandalism is wrong, Marcy.
Marcy|  Okay.
Simon|"  Oh, everything's gone... except for these greeting cards. ""] Aw..."
Marcy|  Simon, look! 
Simon|    What is that thing? This-This is bad.
Marcy|  No.
Simon|  I have to protect us.
Marcy|  No!
Simon|  I have to.
Marcy|  No, don't put it on!
Simon|  Marcy, stay back! 
Simon/Marcy|  Aah!
Simon|  We're getting out of here!
Marcy|   Oops.
Simon|  Hey, little lady, what about a ride on an old man's back?
Marcy|  I can walk. I'm not a child, Simon.
Simon|  Look, sweetie, someday you'll be too big to hold. I'm as old as garlic balls, and if someone offered to pick me up and carry me, I'd do it in a heartbeat. Take it when you can get it. 
Simon|  Gross.  You're gross.
Marcy|  You're gross, Simon.
Simon|  We're both gross, darling.  A food truck! Might be chicken soup inside there.  Alright, now to get some chicken soup inside you-- Clams?  The Clambulance?! No, I need chicken! Marceline, cover your ears! MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER, MOTHER! 
Simon/Marcy|  
Simon|   Mother, Mother!   Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother...! 
Marcy|  What are we gonna do, Simon?
Simon|  We're gonna run! 
Marcy|  Whoa!
Simon|  Come on, come on, come on!!
Simon|  Mama, mama, mama, mama, mama mia!
Marcy|  Our butts are grass, right? 
Simon|  Not yet.
Marcy|  Don't leave me here Simon! I can fight!
Simon|  I'm sorry Marcy.
Marcy|  Simon!
Simon| You have to keep it together Simon... for her.
Marcy|  Simon you promised.
Simon|  
Simon|  Marcy! Look I-I found chicken soup! Your gonna feel awesome in a moment.
Marcy|  I'm just glad  you're ok.
Simon|  Do you feel awesome? 
Marcy|  I love you, Simon.
Simon|  I love you... Gunther.
Jake|  Pretty heavy
Finn|  Whoa, mama
Ice King|  Whoa, so what happens next? How does it end?
Marceline|  Well, little Marcy felt a lot better. And she and Simon lived happily ever after. 
Ice King|  Aww, that's nice.  Marceline, you keep telling these chump stories while I score a bunch of baskets.
Marceline|   Okay.
Ice King|  Yeah, yeah! 
Finn|  Yeah!  Yeah!
Finn|  I found another bike and more computers. What do you got?
Jake|  I keep finding baby shoes!
Jake|  WHAT THE HECK, MAN?! And they're all lefties! Sorry I'm not finding any loot.
Finn|  Keep it together, chubby, because I think we found enough scrap to finish building our gauntlet dock; a dock that is also a gauntlet.
Jake|  Aww. Building this gauntlet dock is hard, man. Hard work sucks.
Finn|  Don't be lazy, Jake.
Finn|  Huh?
Jake|  Incoming iceberg!
Finn|  Whoa! That one's huge!
Jake|  I got dibs! Ooo. I hope it's not baby shoes.
Jake|   It's a guy.
Finn|  Creepy. It's a buncha guys.
Jake|  You know what they remind me of? Well-dressed pickles.
Finn|  Stand back, Jake! I'm gonna melt 'em outta there! Full charge.
Jake|  Whoa, don't roast 'em, man. You gotta flambé.
Jake|  Ah. Perfecto. Bon appetit.
Finn|  Hey! Can you hear me? Hello?
Jake|   I don't think they made it.
Finn|  Hey.  This one's got some kind of pack.
Red-tie businessman|  I remember... business.
Finn|  Let go! Let go! Let go!
Red-tie businessman| We... are Business Men.
Finn|  Oooh... Well, I'm Finn and he's Jake.
Jake|  What kind of business do you do?
Red-tie businessman|  Been frozen... so long, I...  can't remember. Can't remember! Oh. Looking for help, your business? We love work for you.
Finn|  Nah. Adventurers don't need any help.
Jake|  Yes! Help us fix that dock.
Red-tie businessman|  Dock-ka?
Jake|  Yeah! Right over there.
Red-tie businessman|  Yes. This dock-ka... could be more... efficient.
Finn|  No! Wait!
Finn|  Jake, this dock is our fun pie. We should be the ones to bake it.
Jake|  But they're begging for it, Finn. Just look at 'em.
Businessmen|   Build dock. Build dock.
Jake|  Finn. These poor souls are lost without jobs. We can't ignore their plight.
Finn|  Uhh...
Jake|   Go on guys, fix it up!
Businessmen|  Woo!
Finn|  Well... they do seem really happy to do it.
Jake|"  Of course, man. They said they ""love work for you."""
Businessmen|   Uhh... We finish.
Finn|  Whoa!
Jake|  Told ya so.
Finn|  Come on! Let's try it out!
Finn|   Yeah! Woo!
Jake|   Yeah! Woo!  See? If we hire them full time, they'll be back in business and we'll be able to focus on fun stuff. Everybody wins!
Finn|  Maybe you're right.
Jake|   You hear that, guys? Maybe I'm right!
Red-tie businessman|  Really? Job? With... ad-ven-tur-ers?
Jake|  Yeah, mans!
Finn|  Feels weird doing nothing.
Jake|  Relax, man. This is your day off.
Hot Dog Princess|  Help! Somebody help!
Finn|  Trouble, dude! Get your axe! I'll get my... wha?
Red-tie businessman|  Adventure pack... ready for you.
Finn|  Hey, thanks man.
Finn|  I have to say, Jake. My sword is totally shiny and stinkin' sharp!
Jake|  Uh huh.
Finn|  Even my shoes feel different. Not only are they clean, I feel radder, faster, more... adequate.
Jake|  Cool!
Hot Dog Princess|  Help!
Finn|  Don't cry, Hot Dog Princess! Jake and I will fend off these battle cubes!
Finn|  Man. I'm getting tired.
Jake|   Me too. These cubes are... frickin' resilient. Hey, business dudes! Hold off these cubes so we can catch our breath?
Finn|  Jake! They don't know how to fight.
Red-tie businessman|   Water. Orange slices. Help rehydrate.
Jake|  These guys are great, right?
Finn|  I gotta admit... they are helping.  Oh! I think I figured out how to defeat the battle cubes!
Jake|  That's 'cause you had time to rest your body and refresh your brain.
Finn|   Ok! We'll take it from here, guys!
Jake|  Yeah! Good work.
Finn|  Grab all the cubes together!
Jake|  Got 'em!
Finn|  It worked!
Finn|  Wake up, Hot Dog Princess. You're free.
Hot Dog Princess|  Oh! Thank you, Finn and Jake! Especially you, Finn.
Finn|   Ugh. She smells like old hot dog water.
Red-tie businessman|   I take one for team.
Finn|  This is awesome! You get a promotion, fella.
businessman|  Take one for team, too.
Jake|  Oh... Lost again!
Finn|   My turn.
Jake|  What's that?
Red-tie businessman|  Hero vision monitor. Use satellite to tell us world problems.
Jake|  Oh, wow. Anything going on?
Red-tie businessman|  Just small things. You save stress for big thing.
Jake|  Freakin' awesome, man.
Finn|  What are they doing?
Jake|  Takin' care of business.
Finn|  Jake, hit me!
Video game|  Mission complete.
Jake|  Yeah!
Finn|  We beat Adventure Master!
Jake|  Holy moly!
Finn|  We're adventure masters!
Jake|  Woo! Yes!
Finn & Jake|   Ooo.
Finn|  I never knew being fat and lazy was so rewarding.
Jake|  Yeah.  You're gut's so huge and moldable.
Finn|  Hey!
Jake|  Hold on a sec!
Finn|   Man, that tickles.
Jake|   I'm the Ice King, and I'll never find a bride because I'm such a tool.
Finn|   Alright, let me try.
Finn|   I'm Princess Bubblegum and I'm a dork, because I like science! I've also got a really annoying voice that Finn thinks is attractive!
Jake|   That's a- Hey, what'd you say?
Lumpy Space Princess|"  Ahh! Oh, my gosh! Leave me alone. All I said was ""you're ugly,"" which is totally true. Somebody help me! Oh no!"
Jake|  Man, I am not in the mood for saving Lumpy Space Princess.
Finn|  Hey, business dudes!
Finn|  What do you guys think?
Red-tie businessman|  Hmm... Just one monster. We do.
Jake|  Right. We'll just save our strength for the big adventures, then.
Jake|  Ahh. Nice call, dude.
Finn|  Imagine how awesome the adventure's going to be when it's time for us to go out there.
Jake|  I'm too tired to imagine stuff, but I bet you're right.
Finn & Jake|   To being great adventurers!
Finn|  Oh, gosh.
A voice in the distance|  Help us!
Finn|  Huh? Jake! Did you hear that?
Jake|  Yeah. Let the businessmen handle it.
A voice in the distance|  Help! Please!
Finn|  I heard it again.
Jake|  businessmen, dude.
A voice in the distance|  Heeeeeelp!
Red-tie businessman|   Woo-hoo! Woo!
Finn|  Jake! We messed up! The businessmen have gone bat-crazy, dude!
Jake|   Man, just let the businessmen handle it.
Finn|  THE BUSINESSMEN ARE THE PROBLEM, you lazy plug-hole!
Jake|   Huh?
Finn|   Guys!
Finn|  Guys, stop it!
Finn|   Stop it, guys!
Red-tie businessman|  Stop what, boss?
Finn|  You're jacking up those Fuzzy Friends!
Red-tie businessman|  But... We're being heroes. Like you, boss. We're protecting them. Collecting them in our care-sack so they cannot be hurt. It's the most efficient way to save people.
Finn|  But you're making them unhappy!
Red-tie businessman|  Irrelevant! These people are in our care-sack. Their happiness is not priority.
Finn|  I am your boss! And you guys are all fired!
Red-tie businessman|  Fi-red?
Finn|  Nooo! Alright, guys. Now I've gotta take you down... Finn style.
Finn|  I'm kicking your care-sack, dudes!
Jake|  Finn? Whoa... Crud.
Jake|  I'm comin' buddy!
Jake|  Ahh. I'm so fat, dude; I don't know what to do.
Finn|   That's it! Jake! Demoralize them!
Jake|  What? Why?
Finn|  Do it, man! I have a legit plan!
Jake|  Ok, Alright.  Hey! You guys are horrible at business!
Jake|  Huh? They're sucking me up, dude!
Finn|  Now, eat that ice cream some more to become fatter, while also using your Stretchy Powers to grow huge!
Jake|   Ok!
Jake|  This sucks.
Finn|  Yeah, dude! Keep growin'! You're breaking apart their robot!
Jake|  Oh no!
Red-tie businessman|   I'm going to kill you, not-boss!
Finn|  Wait, man! Wait! I wanna re-hire you guys!
Red-tie businessman|  Re-hire? Really?
Finn|  Yeah, mans.
Businessmen|  Woo hoo!
Fuzzy Friends|  Yay! Hip-hip hooray! Pancakes!
Jake|  So, wait... What'd you hire them to do?
Finn|  I hired them to stuff themselves in that iceberg and get outta here.
Jake|   I'm gonna miss 'em. And I'm gonna miss this gut.
Finn|   I'm gonna miss my gut too.
Finn|  Huh? Aww...
Doctor Prince|  Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!

Doctor Prince|  ...You're right. I see your side of things.
Fionna|  You saved the day mega-rad cool guy! What's your name?
Ice King|  Oh, Ice King. I'm such a great guy! This book is yours...

Ice King|   I'm just so glad you guys are real... you're really, really real! I wanna remember this day forever!
Fionna|  Don't be sad, Ice King! We're going on a space adventure!
Cake|  Hop on, baby!
Ice King|  Weehee hee!
Fionna|  Here we gooo!!!!
Slime Princess|  Ice King, stop, please. This story is terrible!
Ice King|  Hm? Wha—?
Toast Princess|  ...I don't even understand...
Wildberry Princess|  Maybe this story is a new form of torture!
Ice King|  Oh, come on! It's a first draft... don't hate! And besides, that story had everything. Action, adventure, a hotter, older guy... Wildberry, don't pretend; I know you like the silver foxes. 
Slime Princess|  What if it were a... little more like real life?
Ice King|  Real? It's based on the real Fionna and Cake!
Slime Princess|  Yeah... but what if there was a little more romance in the story?
Wildberry Princess|  Romance is a great idea!
Ice King|  Y'all are just hatin' on my steeze! I'm not listening to haters. Haters!
Ice King| What the... Whoa... I'm sorry I didn't think you were real, Gob... but now I've seen your power, and I've got some things that I did that I have to say sorry for.
Marceline|  Boo.
Ice King|   Marceline, how long have you been in here?
Marceline|  Mmm... couple hours. 
Ice King|  Oh, so you heard my story, then... Awesome, right?
Marceline|  It's... good... but, maybe it's time to let someone else try.  Listen up, y'all! I've got a story of my own!
Fionna|  Hyah! Hyah!
Cake|  Ooh, nice throw!
Fionna|  Thanks! I've got to do something today.
Cake|  What about Gumball's mission we went on this morning? Delivering daisy chains to the fluffy people not enough for you?
Fionna|  Uh... sometimes Gumball's missions can be so... lame.
Prince Gumball|  Hello, every—
Prince Gumball|  Oh my! Looks like you almost skronked up my dome piece!  Boy, have I got a treat for you two! The fluffy people and I baked these in appreciation for the mission you completed. They're cream puffs... try one.
Fionna|  Uh... I'd love to, but... maybe later...
Fionna|  What was that?
Prince Gumball|  Aww...
Fionna|  Something's on the roof! Come on!
Cake|  I'm not going out there! It's wet.
Prince Gumball|  It is wet...
Fionna|   Mhnn...
Prince Gumball|  Oh... it's just him.
Marshall Lee|  Oh, hey Fionna.
Fionna|  Marshall Lee!
Prince Gumball|  Ahem!
Marshall Lee|   Oh, forgive me! Hello, your majesty!
Prince Gumball|  Fionna, take me back inside.
Marshall Lee|  What? Is he kidding?
Prince Gumball|  Oh, honestly! I'm going in. Come and join me when you want more polite company. 
Fionna|  Be careful!
Prince Gumball|  Whoa!
Fionna|  You got it!
Marshall Lee|  What a wad.
Fionna|   A... a gumwad?
Cake|   Fionna!
Marshall Lee|   Let's ditch him!
Fionna|  Uh...
Marshall Lee|   Lumpy Space Prince is throwing a party in the woods! It's gonna be freaky nasty!
Fionna|  Umm...
Marshall Lee|  I know you're gonna say yes to me, so... Let's just go.
Lumpy Space Prince|  Oh, yeah! Mmmm!
Marshall Lee|  This looks fun... bunch. Come on.
Lumpy Space Prince|  You guys! Marshall Lee's gonna play a song, you guys!
Marshall Lee|  Follow my lead.
Fionna|  Hey! 
Marhsall Lee|  ♫ Good little girl. Always picking a fight with me, you know that I'm bad... But you're spending the night with me... What do you want from my world? You're a good little girl. ♫
Fionna|  ♫ Bad little boy. ♫
Fionna|  ♫ That's what you're acting like, I really don't buy... that you're that kind of guy... and if you are, why do you want to hang out with me? ♫
Marshall Lee|    ♫ Don't you know I'm a villain? Every night I'm out killin', sending everyone runnin' like children. I know why you're mad at me. I've got demon eyes, and they're looking right through your anatomy... into your deepest fears. Baby, I'm not from here. I'm from the Nightosphere... To me, you're clear. Transparent. You got a thing for me, girl; it's apparent. ♫
Cake| ♫ Oh, oh!  I got a hot potata!  And I gots two hot tomatas! Well they'll make a good sauce maybe... ♫
Fionna|  You're not so bad, you know.
Marshall Lee|  Not so bad? I'm the son of a demon... and the Vampire King. It's not something I have to try at. You on the other hand...
Cake|   ♫ ... on the table... the table... for as long as I am able! ♫
Fionna|  I'm not trying to be bad... I'm hanging out with you because you're my friend.
Marshall Lee|  What?  Like him? 
Fionna|   No... different!
Fionna|  Hey! Yah!
Marshall Lee|   Oh no... 
Cake|  Hey, break it up, you too!!
Marshall Lee|  Out of my way, kitty.
Fionna|  Hey!
Marshall Lee|  Oh, come on! That was funny!
Fionna|  Cake! You okay?
Cake|  Yeah...
Fionna|  Come on, let's get outta here.
Marshall Lee|  Hey! Come on... where you goin'? What's the deal? You're missing the party! Fionna, lighten up!
Fionna|  Look, I don't care if you're being a jerk to me... but nobody messes with Cake.
Marshall Lee|  Oh, really? Well, what if I just take her right now, you know?
Fionna|  What?
Marshall Lee|  Unexpected!
Fionna|  MARSHALL!
Fionna|  Cake!
Marshall Lee|  You want your Cake back? Come and get her!
Marshall Lee|   ♫ Did you think I was lying? I said I'm evil, without even trying!  Already dead, so I'm not scared of dying... Drinking the red from your heart in one sitting. You think you've got me pegged, you must be kidding. I raise the dead up, and they do my bidding. Girl, I'm a thousand years old, I'm a riddle... Bad little boy! Yes, I'm bad, but not little. ♫
Cake|  Uh-uh boy, what are you thinking?
Cake|  Fionna!
Fionna|  Cake!
Cake|  Grab onto my little paws!
Fionna|  Marshall?
Marshall Lee|  Oh, this is bad, guys... This is really bad!
Fionna|  Marshall!
Fionna|  Come on! You gotta be okay!
Marshall Lee|  This is it for me, Fionna... so... why don't you just admit it...? You're in love with me...
Fionna|  I-I get that you flirt with me all the time, and it's funny or whatever, but you're doing that now?!  What are you trying to do to my head? You think I've got some little crush on you? Well, for however long we've got left... FOR ONCE, DROP IT, YOU FREAK!
Marshall Lee|  Faking it! Faking it! Okay, my shirt is, like, filled with cream puffs!
Cake|  Oh, goodness!
Marshall Lee|  Glob, Fionna... you're like the realest person I've ever met...  Ow, my cheek meat!
Marshall Lee|  Quit clowning, Fionna. F-Fionna? Fionna!
Marceline|  The end.
Turtle Princess|  Oh hohoho! I loved that one!
Ice King|  Oh, come on! You guys got mad at me for a bad story? I mean it's cute, but... that's not how'd they be! But look, it might not be too late to polish this piece off—let's spitball off some ideas. Like, if Marshall Lee gets sick and dies, but he's got a brother we didn't know about! His name's Marshall Lee...roy. Boom, shocker!  Uh-huh! I feel goosebumps!
Slime Princess|  I like how it is!
Turtle Princess|  Yeah, don't change it!
Wildberry Princess|  Yeah! It's good!
Ice King|   Everyone get out...  I know you're out there somewhere... I just haven't figured out how to get to you... but believe me, I will! I will...
Finn| Yeow!
Toronto| Whoops.
King of Ooo| And I dub thee Sir Jake the Dog.
King of Ooo| You two now comprise the royal guard of the one true princess of Ooo. That's me!  As such, you may no longer own property or operate children and must render all treasure and wives unto your sworn princess within a hangman's fortnight.
Jake|  Joke's on you, man. We spent all our treasure the other day. Plus, don't even have any wives.
Finn| Wait, what? What about Lady?
Jake| Lady's my girlfriend.
Finn| Wait, but...
Jake| That was Tree Trunks.
Finn| Oh, yeah.
King of Ooo| We, the inhabitants of Ooo, owe you heroes our very lives. As the once powerful and dignified Princess Bubblegum sulked off into exile, it fell upon you two to save us from the impending comet of doom and/or from the hideous Orgalorg, who aimed to eat the powerful comet and grow invincible! And for that, we are eternally grateful.
Toronto| I know I am.
King of Ooo| But now your bravery is essential to a new heroic task! Can you guess what it is?
Finn| Uh...
King of Ooo| Come on. Guess!
Finn| Um... Fight a—Fight a dragon?
King of Ooo| Wrong! Follow me.
Finn|  Man, this is stupid as heck. I miss PB.
Jake| Yeah, yes...  I mean, except for this sweet armor, though. This armor is hot like fire.
Finn| Naw, the armor's stupid too.  Dang King of Ooo going around like DJ Snappy.
King of Ooo| This is it, fellas, the only spot in the kingdom left unscoured during my treasure census. I'm afraid it'll explode or something if I open it. But I really think there could, nay, there might be precious treasures in there. So I want you two to do it.
Finn| Man, this...seems like a really bad idea.
King of Ooo| Yeah, well, it's an order from your princess. Get, get, get.
Finn and Jake|  Hey, eh, ooh, oh, ah.
Finn|  Come on! Alright, alright.
Old Banana Guards| Hello.
Old Banana Guard 1| We are the sworn protectors of the forbidden inner sanctum, and to proceed you must answer this ancient riddle...I forgot the riddle.
Old Banana Guard 2| That's okay.
Old Banana Guard 1| I love you.
Old Banana Guard 2| I love you too.
Jake| Hey, there's stairs back here.
Old Banana Guard 3| I love you guys.
Finn| Woah.
Jake|  Wait up.
Finn| It's a dragon...a candy dragon. Look. He sucks the vitamins from the roots. And transforms it into candy juice? And then—And then the juice goes in all those drains. This. This is the lifeblood of the whole kingdom. Power, defense, recreation. This is everything. It cleans, it nourishes, and—and...
King of Ooo| ♪Muh-muh-muh money, money.♪ Go on...
Finn| What are you talking about with all this money talk?
Jake| Yeah, why are you singing the money song?
King of Ooo| What, you don't see it?
Toronto|  They don't see it.
King of Ooo| Look, everyone needs juice to live, right? And I control the source of the juice, so by me charging a mere pittance for every single drop, I can easily quadruple my treasure pile!
Finn| Man, if you think we're just gonna stand here and let...
King of Ooo| Although...if this dragon thing could pick up the pace a bit, we could have enough of a surplus left over to export worldwide! Hey, you there! What do you think about picking up the...
King of Ooo| Looks like the Candy Kingdom empire is finished. But the four of us will live like kings 'til the juice runs out. What do you say, boys? Let's... Huh, I wonder where they ran off to.
Finn and Jake|  Princess, Princess, Princess! Princess, Princess, Princess, Princess!
Princess Bubblegum| Oh, hey boys!
Finn| Princess, sklizz is really blizzed up with the King of Ooo! He really blizzed up all the sklizz.
Jake| He blizzed it all up, man.
Princess Bubblegum| Yeah, well maybe he should unblizz it then.  Why do I always gotta unblizz everything?
Finn| But Princess, under the tree there's—there's a dragon. And he took the juice!
Princess Bubblegum|  Oh no. This is all my fault. Neddy...
Finn| Princess? Princess, what is it?
Princess Bubblegum|  That dragon you saw, he's my brother, Neddy.
Finn|  Whaaaaaaaaa?
Princess Bubblegum| We spawned together from the Mother Gum, and now I'm all he has.
Princess Bubblegum| Neddy's very sensitive. It's not safe for him out there. He needs my help, and I'll need yours.
Jake|  Woah.  Ahhhhhhh.
Finn|  It's pretty quiet, huh?
Princess Bubblegum| Okay, guys. Neddy's in this cave. I know because my bod rod here is calibrated to our sister-brother bond. Now, people frighten him, so I'm going in alone. If he tries to run, STOP HIM.
Jake| I don't think we can. He's a giant.
Finn|  Yup.
Princess Bubblegum| Thanks, guys!
Jake|  This armor is driving me nuts!
Finn| No way, I changed my mind. I feel like a fancy shield. Or if I was like a dangerous candlestick. Like a knight's candlestick.
Jake| You don't stretch, man. This thing's cramping my crimps!  Woo!
Finn| Dude, I don't like that.
Princess Bubblegum|  Neddy, you sweet weirdo. 
Neddy|  Ooooh! OOOOH!
Banana Guard|  Oh nooo! I just want consistency!
Princess Bubblegum|  If the King of Ooo tries to come here again, you have my secret permission to stop him. No holds barred. Moosewood Stadium freestyle.  So, what are you two up to now?
Jake| Eh, garden stuff, I guess.
Finn| Ummm... Hey Bonnie, you always act like a loner, right? But next to your brother, you're the light of the party. Sorry, the LIGHT of the party.
Princess Bubblegum| I mean, yeah. One of the first things I did after making sure Neddy was safe was to start making the candy people. I was formed in the Mother Gum. My mind and my gum were in touch with dozens of others, like a crowded womb. I guess I missed that.
Jake| But Neddy's from the same place you're from, and he's a wet hot dog around everyone.
Princess Bubblegum| People get built different. We don't need to figure it out. We just need to respect it. Maybe he likes his own company better than I like mine.
Finn| Well, do you miss the candy people?
King of Ooo| Hey babaloos, good thing that juice is back on. I was making a mint, but hoo doggie, my candles were starting to turn.  Thanks, Jake.  Ahh, that's the stuff. Hey, do you know if I can drink this? Like, is it like well water? Good for bathing, but not so good for drinking? You know what? I'm going for it!  Yup, it tastes just like you'd think.
Magic Man| Bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz. The waffle doll shall fall lest you eat the yellow dough.  Bzzzzz... 
Jake|  Hmm.  I'll... I'll finish this later.  So tired. And also hungry...  Maybe I should... eat some— 
Jake| Huh? Uh...  Huh. Hmm. Everything's made of... me.
Jake| Pretty neat. I bet there's, like—like a cool city or something around here.
Jake| Nice. Jake City. 
Jake Person| Hi!
Jake| Oh, uh, hi!
Jake Person| Jake! How you doing, Jake?
Jake|  Uh, good, man! Good!
Jake| Man, this place is awesome!  Ooh!  Cool dolls! They look like the rare antique kind. Maybe my kids will like them. Mm. Wonder what my kids are gonna have for dinner. Maybe pizza...
Jake| Whoa-oh! Some kind of Jake-quake...
Goose| Eh? Is that Jake?
Jake|  Hey there, um...
Goose| C'mon, man! It's Goose! Your best friend, Goose!
Jake| Oh, uh, of course! Goose!
Goose| Aww, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake, ya big goof! How long's it been? Two, three years?
Jake| Let's see, uh...  one, two, uh... I've never been here.
Goose|"  ""I've never been here."" You've still got it, Jake."
Goose| C'mon! Let's get you home. Everyone's waiting for you at the party.
Jake| Eh—party?
Goose| No. Par-tay!
Jake|  Do it again, Goose!
Goose| Hey, Jake.
Jake| Hey, what?
Goose| Now that you're back, how 'bout that five bucks you still owe me?
Jake| Uh, what five bucks?
Goose| Cheeseburger cheesecake ring a bell?
Jake| What—? What is that?
Goose| Oh, oh, that. Don't worry about that. Do not—don't worry about that.
Jake|  Guess I'd better not worry about it.  Hmm. I'm hungies, Goose.
Goose| I think there's a leftover nacho basket or something in the fridge.
Goose|  Just a sec.  Cold cut-and-nacho sandwiches!
Jake| All right!  Ow! Something's wrong, Goose. Jakey can't eat any of these nachos...  but Jakey needs nachos! Aah!
Urchin| Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake! Mr. Jake, the Mayor wants to see you straightaway.
Jake| Alright, lad, show me the way! 
Finn| Jake! Hey, I got a for-real important question do you like cereal in your cake? Jake?  Hmm...  Mm-mm-mm.
Urchin| Mr. Mayor.
Mayor| Urchin, thank you for your help. Help yourself to the herring cakes.
Urchin| Right-o!
Mayor|  Hello, Jake. Thanks for making it.
Jake| Heh. Okay.
Mayor| Now look, we're at orange alert here. Below us are gathered the city's top minds.
Jake| Hmm.
Mayor| And they've noticed that our seismographic troubles have increased exponentially since your arrival.
Jake| Mayor, uh, I want to meet these minds.
Mayor| Here are some of the minds.
Scientist| Jake, we want to perform some tests on you to discover the cause of the quakes.
Jake| There's no need. I've got it figured out. The tremors are happening because Jake is hungry,  and his stomach is growling. And the hungrier he gets, the worse the quakes will become.
Jake| I'll prove it!
Scientists| Huh?
Jake| Mention a food item.
Scientist| Omelet.
Jake| What's in the omelet?
Scientist| Chili! It's a four-egg chili omelet!
Scientist| Watch out!
Scientist| Analysis, Tim!
Tim| It's too early to say; this evidence is anecdotal!
Jake| Look, just let me stretch outside to get something to eat, and the quakes will stop.
Tim| That doesn't sound very science-y.
Scientist| No, but you have my permission to test your idea.
Erik Adamkinson| I don't like that idea.
Scientists| Huh?
Erik Adamkinson| If Jake leaves, that would mean the utter destruction of our world. I believe that Jake is an extra-dimensional being, a Glob if you will, whose psychic field holds our world together. If he leaves, his flesh will reconfigure, and everything and everyone here will disappear completely!
Tim| Oh, Erik Adamkinson, you're just a fringe scientist, well known to have a crackpot of crazy theories.
Erik Adamkinson| Hm! Perhaps I am. And maybe I am wrong... but are you really willing to take that chance? We should imprison Jake immediately!
Jake| What?! No way! The world's not gonna end just because I go get a bagel.
Mayor| Seize him!
Jake| Uh, peace! 
Jake| Why?!
Mayor| Finish him.
Jake|  Mm.  Bagel.
Erik Adamkinson| Don't worry, everybody. I will journey to Jake's Glob world, which, legend would have us believe, lies beyond the great sky-hole, and bring back the food of the globs to appease Jake's appetite, thus saving everybody.
Erik Adamkinson's father| Wait! Wait!  I want to go with you, Son!
Erik Adamkinson| I-I'm sorry, Dad. Y-you can't; i-it's too dangerous. Your mind is unprepared.
Erik Adamkinson's father| My son. 
Erik Adamkinson| Huh?  Yeah!
Erik Adamkinson| There it is, the sky ho-o-o-o-ole!
Erik Adamkinson| Phew! Oh, my stars! It's just as I envisioned! Almighty Jake Globs, I beseech your aid! Do you have bagels? Hello? Hmm. Maybe those aren't the true globs. Yeah, they're too ugly to be— 
Erik Adamkinson|  I thought you'd be beautiful. But you're not!  You're hideous! Hideous! 
Finn|  BMO, resume.
Jake| Spaghetti... 
Guard| Don't!
Guards| Huh?
Guard| Hey, you're a le—
Jake|  Huh?
Jake| Goose?
Goose| Go.
Jake| But—but what if Erik Adamkinson is right? What if you and all the Jake peeps disappear and I can't bring you back?
Goose| Then you won't have to pay me back that five bucks.
Jake| But—
Goose| Go eat, Jake!
Finn| Uh, Jake? What's going on, man? Feeling okay?
Jake|  Just getting a snack, Goose.  Just getting a snack.
Finn| Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Finn| Look, Jake.  More guardians. The Citadel, I presume.
Jake| Likely so.
Finn| Hey. Do you think maybe one of them could be my dad?
Jake| Eh, I don't think so. We'll probably know when we see him.
Finn| Right, right. That makes sense.
Finn| Hey! The Lich again! This must be where the prison cells be at. See? Good riddance, too. I hope you rot forever, you awful jerk-clapper. Some people just make the world a worse place to be in just by being around, Jake.  That's right. Bad apples. Lock 'em all up, I say. At the bottom of the ocean, where it's too dark to see.
Jake| Look at that weird ol' kid over there. He looks just like you.  Man, look at his clo—
Finn| Daddyyy!  Aah!  All locked up in there. D-Do you think maybe he's a criminal too?
Jake|  Well, it had crossed my mind.
Finn|  Jeez, man! Now I wish I hadn't said all that stuff before. Now my heart feels yellow and green.  Maybe we shouldn't even have come here—waah!?  Jake, what did you do?
Jake| It wasn't me! It came from up there!
Finn|  He's melting the crystal all up!  Breaking cats out left and right! Turning cats gray! Did he trick us again!? I think he did!
Martin| Hey, kid!  Hey, do me a favor. Get me out of here, huh?  This fire smells crazy!
Martin| Thanks, kid. Now, where'd you guys park your Star Skipper?  This place is coming down quick, and I mean quick, like zip zip. Like wow, like boom boom wow.
Finn| Oh. We... we don't have a Star Skipper.
Jake|  Also, Finn'ss your son.
Martin| Whaaat? No Star Skipper?
Jake| Ahem! I said, Finn's your son. He came a long way to meet you.
Martin| Son? Oh, hey, good for you, kid. In other news, I still gotta get out of here and the ground is melting. Huh?  It's all pooling in the center.
Finn| Hey, um... I... I wanted to ask you something. I... well...  Hey, wait up!   Dad, wait!  Dad, I need to ask you —- aah! 
Jake|  
Starchie| Aaah!
Void Caster| Gree-nah-gah-ga-ba-ga-ga-da-da-ga-ga. 
Jake|  Finn, I know we normally come out of these things okay, but I got a bad feeling about this. Just promise me, if both my eyes get fried off, you'll fry yours off too.
Finn| What? No.  Listen, you don't gotta worry about a thing, Jake ol' pal.  We just need to defeat those five space villains, hijack the shard they're hijacking and sail it home to safety.  Easy peasy.
Martin| Yeah, Jake, smarten up. As soon as the last guardian dies, the fighting stops. See? He's bitin' the dust right now.
Finn| Aahh! Uh oh! 
Martin| It's-- It's okay. It's okay.  You just gotta fetch me a gob of that guardian blood, son. It's got that good nooch that keeps us young in the crystal.
Finn| Nooch?
Martin| Come on now, partner.  No dawdling, yer old man needs ya. 
Martin| Atta boy, Flynn! Do it for yer old man! Yeah, yeah, just get right in there! Don't be shy. Yeah!
Martin| Hey, good job, son! Now, rub some of that sap on my leg there. Make sure to get it into the chicken wing hole.
Finn|  Dad...
Martin| Martin!
Finn| Okay, M-Martin. We need to talk.
Martin| Yeah, okay, kid, but hurry it up. I'm trying to act cool here, but this thing really stings!
Finn|  Why'd you abandon me in the forest when I was a little baby!?
Martin| Oh... I mean... Heh. You know me. I'm a funny guy!
Martin| Ahhh, I dunno. It was a long time ago.  Who knows,  maybe you left me!
Martin|  But hey, daddy's back!   You and me, daddy and baby, or should I say...baby and daddy.  Now slap that sap!  Whoa! Would ya look at that!  Smooth like new.  Pssh, couldn't fix the boot too, huh?
Jake| Dude!!  S'mores important junk happening! Look!
Finn| It's time to peel bananas on this fool, as a family!  How about it, Martin?  Dad?
Martin|  I gotta run to the store!
Finn|  Hrm.  Wha?
The Lich| Fall.
The Lich| You are alone, child.  There is only darkness for you, and only death for your people.  These Ancients are just the beginning.
The Lich| I will command a great and terrible army; and we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. You are strong, child. But I am beyond strength. I am the end.  And I have come for you, Finn. 
Finn|  What? You don't like this stuff, huh?  Whoa!  Right in the doorbell.  Dad.  Jake, finish off the Lich. I gotta go catch my dad.
Jake| Finn, forget that loser!
Finn| Dad, wait!
Martin| Hey, cool guys. Looking for a new boss?  Chew faster, that guy's really moving.
Finn|  Dad! Stop!
Jake|  Finn! 
Finn|  Martin, I won't let you escape!
Martin|  Hey, hey, you're a void caster, right? We gotta put some  gas in this buggy.
Jake| Finn! Let go! He's not worth it!
Martin| Oh, gross. Pedal to the metal!
Martin| Hey, what about air—?
Jake| It'll be okay, dude.
Finn|  I mean, at least you finished off the Lich, right?
Jake| Oh, yeah, that's the good news I didn't have to! One sec.  Up you go! Check this out!  Brand new baby. The Lich is super cute now, and he smells real neat!  That sap rebooted him or something.  I like him a lot.
Starchie| Over here, fellas! Next stop, the Candy Kingdom. Previous stop, this weird place.
Tree Trunks| Mr. Pig, I think we should get a d—
Jake|  Okay, run. Go, go, go!
Tree Trunks| Oh!  Oh, this changes everything!
The Lich| Hello!
