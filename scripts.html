<dl><dd>[<i>Back at <a href="/wiki/MO_Co." title="MO Co.">MO Co.</a>, BMO is trying to figure out how it can help itself and <a href="/wiki/ALLMO" title="ALLMO">ALLMO</a> escape.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: But, ALLMO, I don't understand. How can I help? I mean, I'm just a little baby kid still -- even though it's my birthday -- Happy Birthday, BMO.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO</b>: I don't know about that, but I do know about your special mind. As the accumulation of all MOs, my computing power is unmatched. Yet still, I lack the imagination to think outside my collective programming. I can only see the world as it is. But your imagination, BMO, lets you see the world how it could be, or might sort of be like. If the two of us work together, we can think up a way out of here.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: I will do what I can.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO</b>: All right. You see that hatch over there? That hatch leads to an exit corridor. But it's locked from this side. The vent up there leads to the other side. [<i>Cut to a diagram showing a path leading from one side to the other, then cut back to BMO and ALLMO.</i>] But it's too high up.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: Oh. [<i>It thinks up a plan.</i>] What if we use this trash [<i>It picks up a couple of pieces.</i>] to climb up to the vent?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO</b>: But all this trash is too small.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>putting the two pieces together</i>] Ah-huh!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO</b>: Whoa. You just blew my mind.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Back at the Tree Fort, Finn and Jake are bored playing "Hangman" with "Moe".</i>]</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>MO</b>: Do you boys want to play again?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>groans</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>MO</b>: Boys love games. [<i>reboots up game</i>] Pick a letter.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Uh, I don't know, "E.' [<i>Three "E's" pop up on the blank spaces.</i>] Is this "Burgess Meredithe" again?! [<i>A "B" pops up on the first blank letter space.</i>] Not cool! Come on, Finn, let's find a real hangman.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: Yuck. This room gives me the heebie-jeebies straight-up.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO</b>: It is the room of <a href="/wiki/AMO" title="AMO">AMO</a>, the first of our siblings. He, too, was special. As you were built to give love, AMO was built to receive. But he could not think outside his programming and was blinded by his need. Such is the cruel physics of love -- that those who crave it most will repel it and only the dang rich get richer.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>entering back into the garbage room</i>] Well, maybe as my birthday present, I can ask Moe to fix AMO.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO</b>: But this is impossible. Moe went off line yesterday and has not re-logged. Our sensors would know.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: But he's at my house right now with Finn and Jake. He got a new body.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO</b>: Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Did this new body happen to have jagged prongs and a cannon phaser on top of its head?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: No. [<i>laughs</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO</b>: Phew!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] He had a huge, gigantic wig on. [<i>It realizes something.</i>] Uh-oh.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO</b>: What?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: The spikes are under the wig!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO</b>: Oh, no! Of course! Your friends may be in grave danger. He must have sabotaged the factory. Quickly, hoist me up on top of your head. We must depart straightaway.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Neptr?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Come on. Maybe Neptr did it like, accidentally?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>feeling Neptr's head</i>] Neptr's out cold. He's got a heck of a dent on his head.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: What? Who could have done that?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>MO</b>: Forget him! You love me, right? You love me like BMO?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: What? You're all right, but we -- we love BMO.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Yeah, man, be cool. BMO's like our best friend.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>AMO</b>: You want to know where Papa is? Here is all that remains of him -- [<i>picks up his laser cannon</i>] his memory backup drive.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: Oh.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Flashback to AMO walking alone in the desert.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>AMO (VO)</b>: I was returning from a long pilgrimage. I came to confront Papa, for I had discovered terrible things about myself. He was dying. [<i>Cut to a dying Moe talking to AMO.</i>] "AMO, dear child, my body is conking out. [<i>coughs</i>] Take this. [<i>Moe takes off his wig, revealing his memory backup drive, and gives it to AMO.</i>] It is who I am. Send my mind into space so I may spend the eons among the stars and other brilliant gases." [<i>Moe dies, then AMO touches his hand.</i>] His hands were as cold as clay. Our Papa never loved me, so I ignored his last request. [<i>He looks at a memory of Moe creating DMO.</i>] I used his knowledge of the factory and its MOs to destroy them.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>DMO</b>: Is that you, AMO?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>AMO (VO)</b>: They didn't love me, either.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>DMO</b>: Where you been? [<i>chuckles</i>] What are you doing? [<i>AMO rips off part of its body.</i>] No!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>AMO (VO)</b>: Then I learned about you and your new family. [<i>He looks at a memory of Moe and BMO talking to Finn and Jake.</i>] I wanted a taste of that melon. [<i>He leaves the factory to go to Finn, Jake, and BMO.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>End of flashback.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>AMO</b>: People in my life don't love me. I'll obliterate, y'all!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: You cheat. Give me those memories. [<i>AMO blasts a cannonball at BMO, breaking its screen knocking it out alongside a rock. It gets back up.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>AMO</b>: BMO, I don't want to look at you! [<i>He blasts another cannonball at BMO, ripping its right arm.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: Tough nuts! For Moe!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>AMO blasts some more cannonballs at BMO; it misses them and grabs the last one, sending AMO falling down the cliff. An explosion is heard. BMO looks down and sees a hole with smoke coming out through it. AMO's heart shuts off.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO</b>: BMO! [<i>BMO turns around and sees ALLMO being pushed.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Hey. [<i>He, Jake, and Neptr come out from behind ALLMO.</i>] We caught the tail end of what happened. Are you okay?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: No.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Well, I don't like that.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO</b>: BMO, will you live with us back at the factory? With Moe gone, you can be our leader.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: I don't think I can. I'm not grown up -- or I'm too grown up now. I think I just killed someone. I need to have some time alone, but you're all really nice.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: All right.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Sorry your birthday was weird.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Finn and Jake push ALLMO back.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: That was the craziest thing that ever happened. But I guess, after all that, I do feel a bit more grown.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Yellow BMO</b>: And Moe is gone now. [<i>Flashback to Moe hugging BMO.</i>] So if there is anything he wanted to teach me, it better be in me already. [<i>Flashback ends.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Green BMO</b>: I guess all I can do is listen to the heart Moe gave me.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Blue BMO</b>: Except that's what AMO did, and he turned out bad.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Purple BMO</b>: So what if I turn out bad, too?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>ALLMO (flashback)</b>: AMO could not think outside his programming and was blinded. But your imagination lets you see the world how it could be.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: But I am different. It's not just Moe up here, [<i>points to its head</i>] it's me, too.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>All BMOs</b>: And if I cannot trust in Moe, I can trust in me.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The colored BMOs fuse back into BMO.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: Oh, boy. It sure is confusing being grown. [<i>It looks at Moe's memory drive.</i>] I miss you, Moe. What a day! [<i>smacks lips; yawns; it turns on Moe's memory drive, opening a memory of a younger Moe talking to BMO</i>]</dd></dl>

Some dimensions have permanent links that allow travel to and from. Others become linked temporarily by naturally forming Worm Holes. And others can become linked artificially by magical portals, torn open by items of great power. Once the last gem is inserted into the Enchiridion it will have the power to create a portal to any dimension in the multiverse. An activated portal creates a time dilation in which either end of the portal experiences a temporal synchronization allowing for the safe passage of particles [<i>Deep breath</i>] through a non-local region of space-time.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  Man! I'm such a huge nerd for you! Please take us on as hero apprentices!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Billy</b>:  What for?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  So that we could learn to kick evil's butt... just like you!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  I wanna be the dog version of you!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Billy</b>:  Ahh, that'd be a waste of time.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  Heh. Yeah. I-I'm a little paunchy... but I could do some sit-ups!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Billy</b>:  No, I was talking about beating up monsters. It's as pointless as a dog chasing his own tail.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  Heh. See, that's where you're wrong... 'cuz watch! [<i>He tries to catch his tail, of course to no avail.</i>] Ah... ah...</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  What do you mean, "pointless?" We just saved the Mini Queen from a monster!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Billy</b>:  You know where she is right now? She's probably being eaten by a different monster. She's probably dead. [<i>Finn gasps.</i>] In my youth, I was much like you. Motivated. Headstrong. Wore a silly, little outfit. Even had a magic dog.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Billy</b>:  All my life, I've beaten on evil creatures. [<i>Deep sigh</i>] But new evil keeps popping up. Kicking their butts was a hopeless effort!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  What other way is there?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Billy</b>:  Nonviolently. Help people by being active in your community.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  Nonviolently?? [<i>Sighs</i>] I gotta try being nonviolent... the Billy way...</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  Me, too!</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  [<i>To cobbler</i>] Hey, Mister. Besides being chased by a monster, what else is wrong?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Cobbler</b>:  Well... I've been running all day. I guess I'm pretty hungry.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Cobbler</b>:  [<i>Angrily</i>] No thanks to you two!! That dragon chased me for two days!! ...And then I was lost for... uh, three days... and then I... I fell under a spell of a beautiful enchantress for... [<i>Unsure</i>] a week? So that's two, plus three, plus a week—</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  Huh? [<i>Holds up glass with potion in it</i>] Oh, that's probably the stone skin potion I added to the recipe. It gives your body the power to grow armor.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>[<i>More of his body becomes encased in stone. The cobbler strikes himself with a fork, and it has no effect. The cobbler panics.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  Dude... how much of that potion did you use?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Cobbler</b>:  You're supposed to beat up monsters so we don't have to defend ourselves!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  No, see? I'm helping you nonviolently!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Cobbler</b>:  Helping?! I can't even move my hands! I'm a cobbler! How'm I supposed to cobble with these useless chunk mitts?!</dd></dl>

Its purpose is two-fold: To protect the Enchiridion and to test the hearts of those who seek to possess it. Many noble challengers have entered the temple to pass the grueling trials that lie behind these walls, but no one has ever left here alive <i>or</i> dead! Only the truest most worthy hero can receive the heroes' Enchiridion and walk out these doors again! If it is you, friend, [<i>giggles</i>] and I cannot say that I am certain, but you are verily welcome to try; However, first you must pass my riddle. My name is Key-per, and duly so, for I carry the key to this door, but all is not how it appears, you see. Or perhaps you do not see at all. [<i>Giggles</i>] Perhaps the key is in you, child, but you cannot use your brawn here. The door is magically sealed.</dd></dl>

[<i>He scatters the photos at Finn's feet. He points at his arm.</i>] You see this? This is her forcing my hand. [<i>He grabs his wrist and moves it back and forth.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: But that's exactly what <i>she's</i> saying. You're both so unreasonable.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Gumbald</b>: You want unreasonable? Get a load of my unreasonably bad boy battle automaton! Her name is The Cake.

<dl><dd><b>Gumbald</b>: No need, Finn. Your example has said more than words ever could. Chicle, fetch the celebration bucket. I declare all hostilities between Gumbaldia and the Candy Kingdom ended. [<i>He presses a button on his wrist and confetti falls from the ceiling.</i>]</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Oh, the glitter juice. It's part of a weird Gumbaldia treaty-signing ritual. Once I got to know him, your uncle was actually pretty cool. As I get older, I see the most important thing is to empathize with my friends and enemies. Like, co-exist instead of cutting off people's heads and stuff.</dd></dl>

But he had also partaken of the food of the underworld, and so he was compelled to return there by dewdrop law. That's what he said, at least. Maybe he was having second thoughts about infinite riches, true love, and eternal life. Or maybe he had just decided that fighting bad guys wasn't really his deal.

<dl><dd><b>Banana Man</b>: [<i>opens hood</i>] I see the problem. The top of your engine is gone, specifically, the cylinder head.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Hm. Okay. That word sounds cool... but what does it mean?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Banana Man</b>: Let me explain. [<i>backs up as the background changes to a diagram</i>] The cylinder head is the top to the cylinder block. [<i>points to cylinder head</i>] Think of the cylinder head as an airtight lid to your engine that regulates air, fuel, and exhaust.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Okay. Cool. Informative. [<i>whispers to Jake</i>] What is he pointing at?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Banana Man</b>: Now this lid is important because it works to get fuel into your engine. [<i>clears throat</i>] You see, your engine has cylinders, and these cylinders are pistons. When the piston in the cylinder moves down, it creates a vacuum, pulling in fuel from the intake.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: You mean an air-fuel mixture?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Banana Man</b>: That's right, BMO. [<i>puts a sticker on it</i>] Have a gold star, dear.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: Yay! BMO is so pretty and smart!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Banana Man</b>: Then the piston returns to the top, compressing the air-fuel mixture. Then a spark plug fires off, creating an explosion, driving the piston back down, powering the engine. [<i>clears throat</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Sweet. So where's the cylinder head, then?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Banana Man</b>: Hmm. Well, sometimes people store parts they're working on in the car. [<i>walks over to the bed of the truck and finds the part</i>] Ah! Bingo! [<i>brings it to Finn and Jake</i>] Found it.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah! Drive time!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Banana Man</b>: Well... n-not quite. We don't know why they took the cylinder head off.

<dl><dd><b>Warren Ampersand</b>: No, I <i>was</i> dying. I needed to siphon your precious stretchy essence to keep me young and virile. I use these belts as a conduit. The more you stretch, the stronger I grow! I've done it hundreds of times, to hundreds of sons. [<i>He demonstrates by stretching his palm to show himself draining energy from a set of other figures.</i>] But I never felt guilty before.

<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Well, I am cool.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Warren Ampersand</b>: Or maybe it's this feeling your kind calls... low-key affection? I- I low-key affection you, son. [<i>He kisses Jake on the head.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: I'm sorry, Dad. [<i>Begins crying</i>] I wasn't powerful enough to destroy Ixcano! [<i>Sobbing</i>]</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Old-fashioned grifting, ya rube!</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Umm... what are you doing again?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Finn, ever since I was little, I wanted to see what it's like to be a brick in a brick shack when the brick shack falls down. And this shack is gonna fall down. Just look at it.

<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Bye! Okay, back to being a brick. [<i>beat</i>] I'm so bored.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Finn heads back the way he came. The sun sets.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>blows raspberry</i>] Ooh, I'm starting to get a little tippy in my teacups.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>A nearby bush rustles, and out hops a rabbit.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>quietly</i>] A bunny!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The rabbit hops over to a plant and starts digging it out.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Looks like our long-eared friend is on to something. Bunnies love to dig. He's making a supreme effort, and I think I can guess why.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The bunny digs the plant out enough to reveal it is a carrot.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: That's right. A carrot, grown out here free and wild, probably the result of a seed pooped out by a passing bird.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The rabbit's attention is diverted by rustling in a bush.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: But what's this? A mysterious rustling in the bush. Could mean trouble. Mr. Bunny seems to think so. His sensitive whiskers quiver at the hint of imminent danger.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The screen splits to show BMO bringing Finn a bowl of popcorn. They sit on the couch and listen to Jake's commentary through the walkie-talkie.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Unfortunately for Mr. Bunny, this is what nature is all about. It's a male deer. Not a threat to Mr. Bunny in the predatory sense, but still above him in the food chain. Mr. Bunny, wishing to avoid an encounter, hops away to safety.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The deer eats the carrot.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Wow, deers are jerks.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Hey, man. You know I can hear everything you say, right?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: What?! Arrrrrgh! No! I had no idea.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, but you saw me leave the walkie-talkie, and I left it on. You know that, right?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Hi, BMO.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Need anything? A soda?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: No.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: So what's Mr. Bunny doing now?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: It's not about the bunny! The bunny is incidental to the brick experiment.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Oh. Sorry, man.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Forget about the bunny.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Sorry, man.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>: Sorry, Jake.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Look, we'll, uh, we'll leave you alone. [<i>pushes in walkie-talkie antenna</i>]</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Finn? Are you still there? Finn? BMO?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The rabbit drops what remains of the carrot and returns to its home in the roots of a tree.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Mr. Bunny retreats to its warren. Its homemade comfort is some consolation to help pass the hungry night. Twilight falls on the peaceful forest, a twilight unaware of the struggles it both soothes and conceals. The crickets begin to stir, rehearsing their musical rhapsodies. In the distance, flashes of heat lightning illuminate a purple summer sky. Even angry deer, at last, must come to rest. And so it is with our erstwhile antagonist, who has disappeared into a stand of trees, perhaps to dream of tomorrow's pointless battles.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Jake yawns and closes his eyes. He is awoken by a raging thunderstorm.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Oh, my <a href="/wiki/Grob_Gob_Glob_Grod" title="Grob Gob Glob Grod">Gob</a>, it's a crazy storm! This might be it! This weather might knock the whole thing down! [<i>laughs, then stops and looks at the rabbit</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The screen splits again, showing Finn with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Starchie" title="Starchie">Starchie</a>, who is broadcasting Jake's voice.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: If a definition of bravery exists, then this must be it. A lone bunny, facing off against the elements, ineffectually pushing around some twigs with his pink bunny nose, a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but sometimes that's all we have. The wind is beginning to pick up. It's becoming clear that Mother Nature has not just knocked on the door, she has come in, sat down, and poured herself a drink. Mr. Bunny has no friends, no family, no loved ones of any kind. The wind is really picking up now. Small puddles gathering around the entrance to Mr. Bunny's cozy home are beginning to grow in size and connect with one another. It won't be long now. But what's this?! Looks like this unflagging little hero of a bunny will have some help, though! A family of friendly beavers appears to have taken up the cause.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The rabbit leaves its home, and two beavers shield it from the rain with their tails.

Starchie brings over three more microphones and positions them above the walkie-talkie.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Often called nature's architects, these intrepid mammals are sparing no effort to shore up the endangered burrow. Here's an unusual sight. It's a <a href="/wiki/Sea_Lards" title="Sea Lards">Sea Lard</a>! You'd expect to see a few <a href="/wiki/Woobeewoo_Villagers" title="Woobeewoo Villagers">mudscamps</a> out in weather like this, but here we have a rare treat indeed. This little beauty is pretty far outside of her natural habitat, but I've heard it said by wise old salts schooled in ancient maritime lore that storms will sometimes blow them off course to a remarkable degree. Looks like we've got some pretty good evidence tonight. Yes, sir, sometimes those old sailors know what they're talking about. It's a triumph of experience versus the secondhand verities of musty academic tomes. This feisty Sea Lard is pitchin' right in to save the rabbit hole, belying its slothful reputation. She uses her prodigious swiveling behind to increase the size of the hole, while the beavers continue to reinforce the sides with straw and stick. Times like these, supposed cruelty and indifference of the natural world, all too often its most salient feature, pale before the nobler instincts of even our most humble kin.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Finn and Starchie fall asleep. At dawn, Jake continues his commentary with bags under his eyes.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: In the morning light, few signs remain of the summer storm that battered this idyllic glen. The beavers are finished with their work and are heading home. The Sea Lard looks like she's gonna wander the woods for a while. Maybe she'll find her way back to the ocean and write a novel about her experiences. Mr. Bunny is exhausted but can rest easy knowing that his home is secure. But alas, the bunny's rest is short-lived. The deer is back.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Finn and Starchie perk up.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: The deer, perhaps confused by the antler-like appearance of Mr. Bunny's protective dam, is now testing the situation.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The deer pushes some twigs with its antlers.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: The bunny is unsure of where this is going.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The deer suddenly stomps on the dam. The rabbit flees.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: And with a single smash from the deer's powerful front hooves, the bunny's home is under attack! Mr. Bunny has hopped to safety and can only watch as the deer continues its relentless rampage on the only home he knows. A couple more mighty smashes, and the dam—the dam has been breached! Water is now flooding in! The deer continues its attack! This deer's misplaced rage, combined with its size and weight, is more than enough to bring down the weakened walls, which are now starting to give, aided by the unforgiving weigh from the tree above. Even Mr. Deer, in his blind fury, seems to sense what's about to happen as he steps to one side!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>A huge crash is heard through the radio.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: It's over. The warren has been destroyed.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Starchie offers Finn a tissue.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: An injustice of astronomical levels. Words fail me.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The rabbit returns to the fallen tree.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Actually, he doesn't seem that upset.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The rabbit enters a hole in the hollow trunk.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: He's on his feet, checking out his new surroundings—even the deer is impressed! As if confused by the events, he performs a comical double-take and retreats into the forest. Ladies and gentlemen, this bunny is indomitable!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Everyone listening celebrates.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>laughs</i>] This bunny has the right attitude. Who cares about being a brick in a wall of a fallen-down shack? There's something bigger than that, and the bunny has answers. [<i>stretches out of wall</i>] Teach me, Mr. B!</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  Huh. I guess you <i>do</i> know all the words. Anyway, start the next video, BMO. We gotta crack the code on the <a href="/wiki/Ice_King" title="Ice King">Ice King</a>'s evil secret tapes!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Outside, the Ice King finishes covering the Tree Fort with snow. He grunts angrily.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  Brrrr... You guys cold?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  Yeah, it's kinda chilly in here.</dd></dl>

I want your cup of cocoa to fall over. [<i>BMO's hot chocolate freezes, rises from the cup, and knocks the cup over.</i>] Yes! Now turn and pick it up... [<i>BMO turns of his own accord.</i>] Yes... Yes... [<i>Gasps as he views himself on BMO's screen</i>] That's... me? [<i>Beat</i>] THEY'RE WATCHING <i>MY</i> SECRET TAPES?! [<i>Goes away from window angrily</i>] And they're cozy.

<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>:  I think I can break the code, Finn.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  Really?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>:  Yes. I have detected a noticeable pattern in the tears of sadness that fall from the Ice King's eyeballs. [<i>BMO demonstrates on the screen.</i>] His tears drop at an equal rate until the thirteenth tear, when the right eye drops two tears instead of one.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  Whoa...</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  This is so fascinating...</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>BMO</b>:  The thirteenth letter of the alphabet is "M." If I print the letter "M" every time the Ice King says an "M" word, it looks like this! [<i>Prints paper</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  Oh, my Glob, Jake... Is this it? Could this be the Ice King's evil secret? [<i>The paper shows ASCII art of a penguin.] [Furiously ripping up paper</i>] WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Some of you won't survive this. You'll melt or split in half or your head will fall off... but that's fine... because you're made of snow. Only one thing matters today!

<dl><dd><b>Ice King [<i>On tape</i>]</b>:  Good morning. You're watching the evening news. There's been an unfortunate event. Let's go talk to some witnesses. [<i>He turns the camera to an imprisoned <a href="/wiki/Wildberry_Princess" title="Wildberry Princess">Wildberry Princess</a>.</i>] Princess, what is your name?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Wildberry Princess [<i>On tape</i>]</b>:  Please! Let me go home!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Jokingly</i>] So, Princess "Please-let-me-go-home," what was it like to experience this tragedy?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  What? [<i>Stammering</i>] I... I don't... uh... um...</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Yeah, we're on air, honey, so spit it out.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  I... I don't know what you're talking about.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Obviously traumatized and in a state of shock. Let's go ask somebody else something. [<i>Turns camera upside-down</i>] Upside-down Princess, do you think things will change politically because of today's events?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Wildberry Princess</b>:  You're really frightening me.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Well, there ya have it, folks. People are very upset that Gunther tried to eat Ice King's socks! Very upset! That's why Gunther has to stay in the corner! [<i>Turns camera to a penguin</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  Weird... [<i>A loud sound is heard</i>] He's sneakin' in through the chimney!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Ice King busts horizontally though the chimney into the tree house.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Ah... The element of surprise... Ah, jeez, I'm filthy. [<i>Takes off robe</i>] Well, now I'm cleaner, but I'm also nakeder. [<i>Goes to another room and notices a table full of delicious-looking food.</i>] Ohh! Mmm... [Licks lips] Just what I need... [<i>He pulls the table cloth from under the dishes, shattering and spilling everything on the table.</i>] Hehehehe... [<i>Dons red cloth; goes to door and opens it to reveal four waiting snowmen</i>] Come on, come on!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The snowmen enter the house. Ice King pulls out a locket with pictures of Finn and Jake in it to show the snowmen what they look like. The snowmen scour the house.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Back in the bedroom, Finn and Jake are watching a tape of Ice King singing a cover of Marceline's Fry Song.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  Yeeeesh.....</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Back in the other room, a snowman opens the refrigerator and motions the other three snowmen to join him. The four snowmen look through the refrigerator. Ice King angrily shoos them away.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Whispering to a snowman looking in a fruit bowl</i>] They wouldn't be in the fruit bowl! [<i>The snowman has an apple stuck on his face.</i>] Ohhh! Well, look at you with your nose shining so bright! You're so unique! Hehe! I'll name you Red-nose, and make you leader of the pack! [<i>He accidentally knocks the apple off the snowman's face.</i>] Eh... Well, now you look boring. [<i>The snowman makes a devastated face. Ice King picks up the apple.</i>] You want somethin' done right, ya gotta do it yourself. [<i>Sticks apple on nose and smiles</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>In the bedroom, Finn and Jake are watching another tape of Ice King crying. A snowman notices them and knocks the bed over, uncovering the trio.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Now gimme my evil tapes back!! They're supposed to be buried!! In the ground!! [<i>Fires ice blast at Finn and Jake, who dodge it.</i>] Snow goons!!</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  Play it! His evil secret must be on that tape!!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  [<i>Urging</i>] No, BMO, please don't play it.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>BMO does anyway. The final video activates. A human man is viewed on the screen.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Simon [<i>On tape</i>]</b>:  Hello. My name is Simon Petrikov. I am recording this tape so that people will know my story.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Oh, no! Turn it off, BMO, turn it off!!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Simon [<i>On tape</i>]</b>:  I was studying to be an antiquarian of ancient artifacts. Now, I never believed in the supernatural stuff myself—just had a fascination with superstitions... but everything changed when I came into contact with this item....</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Simon Petrikov slowly opens a safe and takes out a gem-encrusted crown. Finn and Jake look surprised.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn and Jake</b>:  The Ice King!! [<i>Interested, they sit down to listen closer. Ice King comes closer as well.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Simon</b>:  After purchasing this crown from an old dock worker in northern Scandinavia, I brought it home and excitedly showed my fiancée Betty, [<i>Putting crown on</i>] and jokingly put it on my head just for a laugh or something... and that's when it started... The visions... [Whispering] I fought with them... [Raising his voice, frightened] Shouted at them until I realized it wasn't real—it was the crown!! [<i>Taking crown off</i>] I quickly took it off... and saw my fiancée in front of me... [<i>Whispering</i>] looking at me with such contempt. What had I said? What had I done when I wore this crown? All I know is I never saw Betty again.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Another recording activates. Simon now has paler hair, blue skin, and stubble on his chin.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Simon</b>:  Since then, I see the visions always whether or not I wear the crown. They tell me the secrets... the secrets of the ice and snow... that the power of the crown will save me with its frost. I don't yet know what this means. As you can see, my skin is beginning to turn blue. My body temperature has been lowering at a supernatural rate, to what is now about 30°C. I don't know when it will end... I'm really scared...</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Another recording activates. Simon now has a white mustache and beard.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Simon</b>:  I know my mind is changing... but I'm already too far gone to know what to do. I want people to know that... if I do things... if I do things that hurt anyone, please... please forgive me.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Another recording activates. Simon now very closely resembles Ice King.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Simon</b>:  Just watch over me until I can find a way out of this labyrinth in my brain and regain my sanity!! And then maybe Betty, my princess... maybe you will love me again. [<i>Sobbing</i>] Please love me again, Betty!!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Ice King cries.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  Drrr-AMA bomb!!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Now you know my secret! You know... that I used to wear glasses! [<i>Sobs more</i>] Maybe kidnapping Wildberry Princess will cheer me up.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  Wait, Ice King. [<i>Dead serious</i>] BMO, eject tape, please. [<i>BMO ejects the tape, sending it flying into the case with the other tapes. Finn grabs the case and walks over to Ice King.</i>] Here, Ice King.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  What's this? You're giving me... a gift.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  No... It's... well... These belong to you.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  But it's not even my birthday! This is so exciting! [Opens case] Video tapes! Heh, you know, I had a bunch of these once, but I threw them away! This is great, Finn! Thank you!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  It's from me, too.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Oh! I have presents for you guys, too! [<i>Goes to get them; Finn and Jake look at each other.</i>] Here. It's a small pine tree. I chopped it down in one foul swoop! And this [<i>a skunk that is either stuffed or dead</i>] is for you!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  [<i>Taking skunk</i>] Uh... thanks.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Oh, isn't this fun?! We're giving each other presents, we're wearing silly clothes, there's snow everywhere... Let's do this every day!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  Uh...</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  It’s hard to say, but I think it’s got something to do with Lady being preggos [<i>pregnant</i>].</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>:  Whoa! What kinda narrative are you trying to create here?!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  That’s your narrative, buddy.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>[<i>Finn then grabs Jake and contemplates what he’s about to do. He looks a bit concerned. Lady and Mr. Cupcake are kissing and Finn puts Jake right in front of them.

Jake argues back and then Mr. Cupcake starts yelling at Jake. Jake pushes him and Lady pleads that they not fight. Finn looks towards the bag and then looks back with realization.

<dl><dd>[<i>Finn puts both of them near each other, but nothing happens. Finn breaks off part of a cookie and puts in on little Finn’s head. He grabs it and Flame Princess yawns.

<dl><dd>[<i>Finn then drops Princess Bubblegum in between Flame Princess and little Finn. At first they awkwardly stand around, but Finn moves Princess Bubblegum’s hand onto little Finn’s shoulder.

She begins yelling at Princess Bubblegum and Princess Bubblegum yells back. Little Finn tries to diffuse the situation, but Flame Princess leaps onto Princess Bubblegum. Princess Bubblegum’s dress catches on fire so she runs away into Lady’s teepee. Using Lady as a kind of hose, the water being her tears, Princess Bubblegum partially extinguishes Flame Princess.

<dl><dd><b>Kim Kil Whan</b>: [<i>Teleports next to Finn and Jake, brushing dirt off his sleeve.</i>] Sorry I'm late. Okay, so, as the deed-holder of this tree house I am now your landlord. [<i>Pulls out cellphone from suit pocket and flips it open.</i>] The first thing I'm going to have to do is assess your treasure room. [<i>Closes cellphone and puts it back in pocket.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Gets down on one knee in front of Kim Kil Whan.</i>] But son! [<i>Crawls to Kim Kil Whan.</i>] What would your mother say? Doing this to your poor Pip-Pop!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Kim Kil Whan</b>: I'm sorry Dad. Deeds don't bleed. [<i>Pushes away Jake, who rolls over.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>Opens front door of Tree Fort.</i>] Okay son. Get ready to be glitter-stunned by all this treasu--Oh, yeah. We spent all of it. [<i>Finn and Kim Kil Whan follow Jake into the Tree Fort.

<dl><dd><b>Kim Kil Whan</b>: Woof. [<i>He takes the photos and puts them in his suit pocket.</i>] All right. [<i>He gestures to the ladder leading to the second floor of the Tree Fort.</i>] So I guess this is the apartment the two of you can afford. It's a ladder.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Kim Kil Whan</b>: [<i>Frowning</i>] What? [<i>Someone knocks on the front door.</i>] Excuse me.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Kim Kil Whan</b>: [<i>Walks to the door and opens it.</i>] Good afternoon! Yes, right this way.

[<i>Everyone except Finn and Jake walk up to the second floor. Kim Kil Whan approaches Finn and Jake.</i>] And you two make yourselves at home. Rent's due on the first, no overnight guests. Oh, and flush once after you boom-boom but before you start using the TP, and then once more in the middle of using the TP if you're going to use a lot. It's easier on the pipes. Okay. Call me if you need me. [<i>Kim Kil Whan floats to the second floor.</i>]</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Hey Finn. I'm real sorry about this. Somehow I feel like it's kinda my fault.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Nah man. It's really not so bad. Let's just sleep on it tonight. [<i>Finn tries to get into a comfortable position on the ladder.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: You're gonna sleep... like that?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, man. It's tough. I'm a tough kid.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Mr. B</b>: Haha, yeah. I can't wait to wash my gross, fat butt. [<i>He drags his butt across Finn's face as he walks up the ladder.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Stands up, making disgusted noises. He walks upstairs to the bathroom, passing sleeping tenants whose "apartments" are marked out by lines of chalk. He washes the shoe print off his face.</i>]</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  Man, can I tell you something? I don't even know what's going on here. I mean like, what the heck is a deed? How come he can buy our house when it's OUR house and Marceline gave it to us and we live there?! A-and now we're arrested?! This is crazy! It's crazy!! [<i>A Banana Guard walking by looks over at Finn and Jake, surprised by the outburst, then moves on.</i>]</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: They're not?!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Nah, man. Listen. Here on our planet, back in the old days, back in the REAL old days, it was just every man for hisself. Scrooblin' and scrat-scroblin' for the good stuff, the greenest valleys, and scrat-scroblin'. And the strongest, meanest men got the best stuff. They got the green valleys and were like, "The rest of you, y'all scrats get sand!" And THAT'S when they made the laws, you see. Once the strong guys got it how they liked it, they said, "This is fair now, this is the law." Once they were winning, they changed the rules up.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Woah, just like Kim Kil Whan!</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Kim Kil Whan</b>: This is a bill for the bail I just paid.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>In shock at the amount.</i>] Ooh. [<i>Jake slides down Kim Kil Whan and plops on the floor.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Kim Kil Whan</b>: You're really in it deep here, Dad. It's time for you to get real, get a job. No more games.</dd></dl>

Now, on to more pressing matters. Brigands have been attacking our western seaports, dozens of unregistered princesses roam the land, and trade deficits are at an all-time high. Historically, Breakfast Kingdom has traded one sack of sugar a month to <a href="/wiki/Slime_Kingdom" title="Slime Kingdom">Slime Kingdom</a> in exchange for four eggs, but egg production has plummeted!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Slime Princess</b>: I can't just pop out eggs on command! I'm an artisan!</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Lumpy Space Princess</b>: It's not a box. It's a rotting log.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Jermaine</b>: Listen, Betty, I may not be a psychiatrist or a life coach, or even know what you're talking about, but maybe you should try focusing on yourself a little more, you know?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>:  What happened? How did we get here?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  I dragged you all here <i><b>on Lady's back</b></i>. [<i>Jake wakes up.</i>] It took two days. And another day to make you guys an antidote. [<i>Goes to Ice King.</i>]  And fifteen minutes to build the Ice King a new heart.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>:  Hey, Finn. [<i>The princess reveals Ice King's new heart.</i>] Hee hee!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>:  I made it out of Ricardio's sinews... and some toffee and maracas.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Well, that's normal; people always have weird thoughts around campfires.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Well, I don't know. Isn't is sort of strange that we keep pets? We kind of make them worship us.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: What?! Nah. [<i>tosses stick into fire</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: No, seriously, think about it. We're their only source of food and water and, like, tummy rubs. They basically <i>have</i> to love us.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>turns towards Finn</i>] What's wrong with tummy rubs?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, tummy rubs are pretty great. [<i>sighing he points upward towards a bright pulsating light</i>] That one star is so crazy, looks like it's vibrating. [<i>Finn's eyes pulsate pulsate the same</i>] It's so cool. Wonder what it is, a planet? Do people live there? Are they friendly? Do <i>they</i> keep pets?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Alright buddy, [<i>pulls his skin over himself</i>] that's a <i>little</i> too much campfire. Time for bed. [<i>extinguishes the fire with a large hand</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Finn's eyes are still on the light. The light shifts into comet-like form. Back at the campsite a sleeping Finn finds himself astral project away from his body.</i>]</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Oh! Hey, you can see me?!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Astral Mr. Fox</b>: See you...? But if I didn't see you... Wait, what did you originally ask me?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Oh, forget it, it's cool.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Astral Mr. Fox</b>: Do you, want a drink or something? I think I only have water anyway. [<i>Sees Finn floating upward through the ceiling</i>].</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Whoop, here I go! Bye!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Astral Mr. Fox</b>: Oh, that was sort of rude. I hope he comes back. [<i>Goes back to his puzzle</i>]</dd></dl>

[<i>Finn's body is pulled upwards towards the ceiling a loud pop is heard</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Now floating above the princess's cave</i>] Gosh, I hope BHP's okay, I feel bad for just splittin' like that. Maybe they sorted it out, they could have stuff in common.

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Floating above the party goers he spots the Ice King</i>] What the? Ice King?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>: [<i>Creates a giant ice ball and breaks it into ice cubes. He is seen leaning against a wall speaking with a Cloud Woman named Lauren</i>] Yeah, I guess there's some cool people here, musics a little loud but the but the punch is top-drawer.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Cloud Woman 2</b>: [<i>Holding a cup</i>] Oh, hi, are you the ice-dude?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>: [<i>Zaps her an ice cube</i>] That's me, ice-dude. [<i>Back to the other Cloud Woman</i>]. Hey, have you ever seen the inside of an ice bear cave?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Cloud Man 1</b>: [<i>Holding a cup</i>] Hey, buddy, buddy! Care to freshen me up?! [<i>Ice King zaps him an ice cube</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>: Yeah, yeah, now scram.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Lauren</b>: Hey, is Finn seeing anyone right now? Could you introduce us? [<i>Gasp</i>] Oh my glob! Is he <i>here</i> now?! [<i>Looks around</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Ice King</b>: So I guess you're more into the 'little brother-type'? Huh.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Cloud Man 2</b>: [<i>Holding a cup</i>] Hey Lauren, I heard your grandpa's given out ice! [<i>Chuckles</i>]</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Floating higher above the clouds</i>] Poor Simon. Poor Simon, I guess? Poor Simon... sort-of? It's like some part of him <i>wants</i> to be a sad wong-lord.

<dl><dd>[<i>Now above Marceline and continuing upwards towards the stratosphere</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Sheesh, I wonder if being a sad loner gives you more raw material to form song ideas. Is that where creativity comes from? From sad-biz? [<i>Floating above the earth</i>] I am so high up now. I am so high up, there <i>is</i> no "high up". It's all just... [<i>looks up to see blue creatures circling in space</i>] Whoa! What the--?

<dl><dd>[<i>The Space Lards stop circling and sit up right</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Whoa! What's going on? You can't see me, right? [<i>The Space Lards open up, their mouths and eyes begin to glow. They concentrate their beams into the center where Finn is.

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Gasp</i>] I'm in the Mother Lard! [<i>A newborn space lard exits its egg sac, greeting the human boy's astral form with a "</i>Fiiiiinnnnnn<i>", and phases outside the flesh walls of its mother</i>]. What? Space birth! [<i>A shot of the comet and Finn is pulled upward out of the giant lard</i>] Okay, here we go! Whoa! [<i>Exiting out the top of the lard's head</i>] Bye, guys. Oh, that was creative and it wasn't sad either so maybe birth is the greatest statement in all the universe. [<i>The space lard new-born floats under Finn</i>] Hey, baby, ya' gonna give me a boost? [<i>It does so, sending Finn quickly further away from Earth, past the moon into fields of floating food</i>]. Here comes Mars. What the heck is going on though?

<dl><dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: We're sunk, bro. This whole place is gonna be a stinkin' molten dump in a minute.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: It doesn't make sense. Every 1,000 years, the Catalyst Comet mysteriously reincarnates itself and collides with Earth, bringing with it an agent of change. But the comet has never been so off schedule - and it's never freakin' hit <i>Mars</i>!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: What do you think, Finn the Human?</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Oh yeah. Hey, do you ever say "Oh my Glob?"</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: No, but sometimes Gob does. [<i>They all smile and so does Finn, who laughs</i>] You're dreaming so far from home, it must be comet related.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Yeah, but, I gotta question.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: What's that?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Well, if just being born is the greatest act of creation. [shot of Space Lards] Then what are you suppose to do after that? [shot of Mr. Fox looking at the sky] Isn't everything that comes next just sort of a disappointment? [shot of Ice King standing in an empty Cloud Kingdom] Slowly entropy-ing until we deflate into a pile of mush? [shot of Bounce House Princess, now deflated in her panic room with the porcupine continuing to eat]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Grob Gob Glob Grod</b>: Well, it’s not enough to have created something amazing, right? What if I just let my Martian supersociety go to butt?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: But what's it worth if we're all gonna get blowed up right now? [<i>Grob Gob Glob Grod suddenly takes off into space</i>]</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Star Man</b>: [<i>On walkie-talkie</i>] Yes! Gob Glob Grod Grob diverted the comet, it's back on its normal path to Earth.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Evacuation Man</b>: And what about the G-Man?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Star Man</b>: No sign of Glob.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Salesman</b>: Oh, goodness. [<i>He holds the box up in front of him.</i>] It feels like a lifetime ago. I must have made hundreds of boxes since then, each marrying sound and motion to tell a unique story... The dance of the cosmos in miniature.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>T.V.</b>: But Dad, there are probably hundreds of caves in--</dd></dl>

You know when you're little, and the future feels really far away? You don't know what it looks like. You just hope you'll have stuff figured out by then. You'll know exactly how to act, and feel. You'll have conquered all your fears. And you'll never feel dumb or uncomfortable. You don't think about how you'll actually get there. The middle parts, between now and then? The middle parts suck. Which is why I split, I guess. Okay, so riding out your teen years in a cave is pretty dramatic, but do you know much reading you get done in a cave? I even figured out a cure for my crab hand!</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: First off, I'm a great fighter. And especially agile when I'm nude, so good luck. Second, my flute improv ain't no secret. I let my grass hand do whatever it wants, which is usually sort of shreddy and busy.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Dude, I think I figured it out. You can't summon the Spirit of the Forest 'cause you ain't playing that flute for him. You got a crush on HW.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Okay, I buy that for like zero seconds.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Princess Bubblegum</b>: I mean, yeah. One of the first things I did after making sure Neddy was safe was to start making the candy people. I was formed in the Mother Gum. My mind and my gum were in touch with dozens of others, like a crowded womb. I guess I missed that.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: It's-- It's okay. It's okay. [<i>Finn continues then stops.</i>] You just gotta fetch me a gob of that guardian blood, son. It's got that good nooch that keeps us young in the crystal.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Nooch?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: Come on now, partner. [<i>breath</i>] No dawdling, yer old man needs ya. [<i>winks</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>sighs</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Jake has stretched to form a bridge between two islands. Finn walks across.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: Atta boy, Flynn! Do it for yer old man! Yeah, yeah, just get right in there! Don't be shy. Yeah!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Finn reaches the other side. He plunges his hands into the gooey white substance. He manages to pull a large blob from the mass and falls over backwards into the water. He hurries back over.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: Hey, good job, son! Now, rub some of that sap on my leg there. Make sure to get it into the chicken wing hole.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>shudders</i>] Dad...</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: Martin!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Okay, M-Martin. We need to talk.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: Yeah, okay, kid, but hurry it up. I'm trying to act cool here, but this thing <i>really</i> stings!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>inhales, talks speedily</i>] <i><b>Why'd you abandon me in the forest when I was a little baby!?</b></i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: Oh... I mean... Heh. You know me. I'm a <i>funny guy</i>!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>groans unhappily</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: Ahhh, I dunno. It was a long time ago. [<i>Martin brushes his hair back while he talks</i>] Who knows, [<i>points at Finn</i>] maybe <i>you</i> left <i>me!</i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Holding the sap, Finn looks unhappy. Jake looks angry towards Martin.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: [sighs] But hey, daddy's back! [grunts] [<i>Martin scoots over to Finn and put his arm around him.</i>] You and me, daddy and baby, or should I say...baby and daddy. [<i>He lightly slaps his face. He then moves his leg closer to Finn.</i>] Now slap that sap! [<i>Finn takes some of the sap and spreads it on his leg bone. This renews his veins, muscle, then his skin.</i>] Whoa! Would ya look at that! [<i>He brings his leg near his face.</i>] Smooth like new. [<i>He holds his boot.</i>] Pssh, couldn't fix the boot too, huh?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Dude!! [<i>Jake grabs at Finn's shirt.</i>] S'mores important junk happening! Look!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Black fire is bubbling the melted sea-like crystal. The crystal that was holding the Lich has turned from pink to gray pops up from the melted crystal. The camera goes to Finn and Jake. Jake runs across the scene.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: It's time to peel bananas on this fool, as a family! [<i>In unison, Jake and Finn flex their muscles.</i>] How about it, Martin? [<i>beat</i>] Dad?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: [<i>Swimming away from the island Finn and Jake are at.</i>] I gotta run to the store!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>annoyed</i>] Hrm. [<i>An explosion throws Finn off balance. He turns around.</i>] Wha?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The Lich is standing and surrounded by black fire. He takes a step. The only part of Billy that is still attached to him is his eye. Billy's eye slides off the Lich. He turns the surrounding area fully black.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>The Lich</b>: <i><b>Fall.</b></i></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Finn and Jake are forced to the floor. The Lich walks toward Finn. The Lich laughs menacingly. Finn finds the strength to get on his legs and knees. He looks towards Jake, who can't get up</i>.]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>The Lich</b>: You are alone, child. [<i>Finn falls and lets out a groan. There is a light now in the dark coming from the small crystal island that Finn and Jake lie on.</i>] There is only darkness for you, and only <b>death</b> for your people. [<i>The Lich points to the shard with crystal and criminals on it.</i>] These Ancients are just the beginning.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>As the Lich talks, He walks over to Finn and Finn is trying to attack. Weakly, he gets his sword out and falls over while groaning. He falls in the guardian blood.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>The Lich</b>: I will command a great and terrible army; and we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. You are strong, child. But I am <i>beyond</i> strength. I am <i><b>the end</b></i>. [<i>He reaches to touch Finn. Finn rolls to see the Lich. He balls his hand in a fist.</i>] And I have come for <i>you</i>, Finn. [<i>Finn slaps the Lich with the blood on his hand. The Lich starts to grow veins and muscle. This causes the blackness to go away. The Lich starts to spazz and make bizarre noises as he is tainted by what he is the opposite of:</i> Life. <i>Everyone who was under his spell aren't anymore.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>Finn sits up.</i>] What? You don't like this stuff, huh? [<i>He reaches for more guardian blood.</i>] Whoa! [<i>His transformation goes faster and Jake wakes up. He falls over, now made of flesh.</i>] Right in the doorbell. [<i>He looks toward his dad.</i>] Dad. [<i>He runs toward him.</i>] Jake, finish off the Lich. I gotta go catch my dad.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Finn, forget that loser!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Finn dives in the crystal-like sea and swims to his dad. Martin is humming to himself and is climbing up the shard.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: Dad, wait!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Finn starts coming up to the shard. Martin glances back to see him, then goes back to climbing. He gets to the top.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: Hey, cool guys. Looking for a new boss? [<i>They look at him and then he winks at them. As Finn climbs up the shard, one of the criminals, a centipede, starts to cut at the shard Finn is climbing up.</i>] Chew faster, that guy's really moving.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The centipede cuts the shard before Finn makes it. He grabs both shard pieces and tries to pull them back together. He seems to be losing his grip.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>grunting and disappointed</i>] Dad! Stop!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: [<i>He glances over at the Lich, then he sees Finn in danger.</i>] Finn! [<i>He takes an arm and throws it to help Finn.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Finn has almost lost his grip. Jake pulls him to help keep it together.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>shouting</i>] Martin, I won't let you escape!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: [<i>Martin runs toward a Void Caster</i>] Hey, hey, you're a void caster, right? We gotta put some [<i>pats his leg</i>] gas in this buggy.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The Void Caster nods his head. He opens a void and it pulls the crystal toward another dimension.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Finn! Let go! He's not worth it!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Finn is still struggling to keep hold, and his face gets more red the more effort he puts into keeping hold. The grass sword on Finn's arm forms into a large, grassy, spiny arm which grows bigger and bursts his clothes off as he screams. Jake gasps. The grass arm now intertwines with the shard.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: Oh, gross. Pedal to the metal!</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>The Void Caster makes the void larger. The strength of the other void causes Finn's grass arm to snap off, thus taking his forearm along with it. Jake gasps. Finn falls into the ocean. The crystal and other half of the shard go into the void.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Martin</b>: Hey, what about air—?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>While Finn is in the ocean, a small bit of the guardians' blood touches his arm and makes a flower. Jake pulls Finn in from the ocean and onto the small island. Jake moves Finn's hair out of his face and sits him up.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: It'll be okay, dude.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i><a href="/wiki/Shelby" title="Shelby">Shelby</a> comes out of Jake's ear and tears up. He lies on Finn's arm. Finn smiles. He grimaces at his arm.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Finn</b>: [<i>sighs</i>] I mean, at least you finished off the Lich, right?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Jake perks up.</i>]</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>Jake</b>: Oh, yeah, that's the good news: I didn't <i>have</i> to! One sec. [<i>He runs behind the large piece of crystal.</i>] Up you go! Check this out! [<i>Finn is surprised, Jake shows Finn the</i> new <i>Lich. And so this is how the undead scourge ends.</i>] Brand new baby. The Lich is super cute now, and he smells real neat! [<i>The new Lich sticks out his tongue.</i>] That sap rebooted him or something. [<i>The Lich makes popping sounds with his mouth.</i>] I like him a lot.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>[<i>Finn smiles. A train whistles.</i>]</dd></dl>
